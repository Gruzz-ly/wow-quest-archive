==Objectives==
Collect and feed 5 pieces of [[:Charred Basilisk Meat]] to the Spawn of Smolderos.
*[[Spawn of Smolderos]] Fed x5
*[[Fiery Leash]] (provided)

==Description==
Hmmmphh.... it seems they'll let anyone in these days.

Very well. You doubtlessly became acquainted with [[Smolderos the Carbonizer|Smolderos]] in the proving grounds.

Well, I've been entrusted with the care of one of his pups. Quite the little terror—if he grows up to be anything like his father he shall serve our cause well.

Collect meat from the [[basilisk]]s from the area and feed them to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
Well... is he fed? I'm not taking him back unless the little monster's not hungry anymore.

==Completion==
Excellent. This little pup will grow to be strong and merciless like his father.

==Notes==
Use the Fiery Leash to summon the Spawn of Smolderos, then head out and kill some [[Spinescale Basilisk]]s. Loot the Charred Basilisk Meat from the corpses and use them to feed the core hound pup, which does attempt to "help" kill the basilisks...
