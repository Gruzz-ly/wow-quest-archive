== Objectives ==
Step back through the [[flamegate]] and return to {{NPC||Tortolla}} at the [[Scorched Plain]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
I'll escort the {{NPC||Child of Tortolla||Children of Tortolla}} out of here and seal up this accursed portal.

I'll leave it to you to inform Tortolla of our victory. Simply step back through the flamegate. The ancient will be pleased!

== Completion ==
You've been to the firelands?

{{NPC||Nemesis}} is dead?

So it is finished.

Thank you.

== Notes ==
Step out back to the surface and fly across the Scorched Plain back to the edge of the [[Regrowth (subzone)|Regrowth]] where Tortolla awaits.

==Progression==
