== Objectives ==
Slay 8 Charbringers.
*[[Charbringer]] slain x8

== Description ==
<Name>, these fiends from the [[Twilight's Hammer]] are attempting to scourge this [[Mount Hyjal|whole mountain]] clean of all life. Even now they trail behind this [[The Inferno|inferno]], leaving death and ash in their wake.

{{NPC||Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem}} is behind the fires, trying to salvage the wilderness before it's blotted permanently from the map. Travel southeast, through [[The Inferno]] and down the road beyond. Find and aid the Arch Druid.

On your way there, clear the roads by killing any Charbringers that you find.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Have you made any progress clearing the road to this shrine?

== Completion ==
Very good. The Twilight's Hammer must be sent the message that we will never give up.

== Notes ==
Head south, killing [[flamewaker]]s along the way. As the road turns to the east, the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]] can be found south of the road and the [[Ashen Lake]]. Hamuul is there, as are {{NPC||Rayne Feathersong}}, and two vendors: {{NPC||Inoho Stronghide}} and {{NPC||Nenduil Meadowshade}}.

==Progression==
{{Sanctuary of Malorne}}
