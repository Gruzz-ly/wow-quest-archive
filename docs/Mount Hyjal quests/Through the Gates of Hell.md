==Objectives==
Pass through the portal atop [[Nordune Ridge]] and help [[Malfurion Stormrage|Malfurion]] secure a Foothold on the [[Molten Front]].
* Secure a foothold in the Firelands

==Description==
There will be time to mourn for [[Hamuul Runetotem|Hamuul]] later. His is the first of many inevitable casualties in this war.... but our attack cannot wait, nor should the momentum we have gained over the last several days be wasted.

The portal atop Nordune Ridge is now open. Our reinforcements are prepared, and they await only my order to pass through the portal.

We will meet again on the other side of the portal. Once there, we shall ensure that our foothold is secure.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*86750 XP (or {{cost|20|67}} at max level)
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x15 and {{cost|18|80}}
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Completion==
Very well done, <class>. We've managed to take a foothold in our enemy's realm without their notice. Our armies are moving through to establish a front as we speak.

We have a long, brutal war ahead of us. It is my hope that you'll be around to help us see it through.

==Notes==
Fly up to [[Nordune Ridge]], where at {{co|27.5|56.4|Mount Hyjal}} is the Portal to the Firelands, which has finally been activated. Take it!

Malfurion and [[General Taldris Moonfall]] are tanking the [[Obsidian Slaglord]], an elite. Help them out, as they will not complete the fight on their own.

The slaglord has the following ability outside of basic melee:
*{{abilities|Obsidian Devastation|Summons massive Obsidian Spikes to erupt from the ground around the caster, dealing 0 Physical damage and knocking nearby targets back.|note=Channeled. The ground lights up a few seconds before the spikes rise. The spikes will follow the player around. They hit for a few thousand damage.}}

The slaglord is fixated upon Malfurion, so unload as it is impossible to pull aggro. Occasionally an [[Obsidian Monstrosity]] will join the fight, aggroed upon the player. Kill it, then go back to the Slaglord. Malfurion also channels Tranquility on occasion, healing for roughly 40,000 health a tick.

Once the slaglord is dead, Malfurion runs off:
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Well done. We should be safe for the moment, but we haven't much time.}}
He runs into the Sentinel Tree off to the left. Follow him and speak to him to continue.

On complete:
:''Malfurion starts a channel.''
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|With this seed, we set root. With time and attention, we should be able to grow shelter from this charred, hostile realm.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Here we will hold firm against the onslaught of the elements.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Here we will draw the attention of Ragnaros' army so that others might strike at the heart of his realm.}}
:''Malfurion walks outside. The breach is under siege!''
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|And now, the war begins.}}

Three dailies open up from [[Rayne Feathersong]] and General Taldris Moonfall, on either side of Malfurion's position outside the tree. [[Captain Irontree]] also offers a daily quest. Head out on those four. When returning to the breach, the phase has advanced slightly. Malfurion now also offers the opportunity to recruit the [[Druids of the Talon]] and the [[Shadow Wardens]] to the fight. Gather 150 Marks of the World Tree and it will be possible to unlock that faction's quests.

Back at the Sanctuary of Malorne, [[Matoclaw]] offers [[The Fate of Runetotem]]. Shockingly, Hamuul did not die in Leyara's attack. Additionally, another daily quest is up at the sanctuary as well.
