== Objectives ==
Run away from the {{NPC||Blazing Trainer}} within the [[Forge of Supplication]] for 1 minute.
*Physical Training

== Description ==
Before we go any further, we're going to have to get you into shape.

Devotion to the [[Old Gods]] is not going to save you when some [[green dragon|emerald dragon]] comes chasing after you. You need to be fleet of foot, if you catch my drift.

Enough said. We'll summon your trainer... your job is to run away from him without leaving this camp.

Go!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Yes?

== Completion ==
Oh. You're still alive.

Not bad.

== Notes ==
Accept the quest and then start running away. The Trainer doesn't run that fast, but remember to stay inside the forge subzone. He hits for 15-1600 on cloth, though.

On accept:
