== Objectives ==
Step through the flamegate atop the [[Lightning Ledge]] in [[Mount Hyjal]], and speak with {{NPC||Jordan Olafson}} within.

== Description ==
;Lo'gosh
:Atop the Lightning Ledge, the Twilight's Hammer has erected an enormous flamegate. I do not know where it leads; I know it is not of this realm, and I cannot enter. None of my other followers have returned.
:I need you to enter this realm and be my fangs within. Step through the flamegate. If he is still alive, meet with Jordan Olafson inside. He will give you a token that will allow you to use my powers in that realm.
:Be bold, <name>. Find out where that flamegate leads, and destroy whatever lies within.
;Takrik Ragehowl
:<name>! {{NPC||Lo'Gosh}} needs you. Atop the Lightning Ledge, Twilight's Hammer has erected a flamegate. We don't know where it leads, but nobody who's gone through has returned. You are to venture inside and be the fangs of Lo'Gosh within.
:Step into the flamegate and talk to Jordan Olafson when you get inside. He'll give you a token to allow you to use Lo'Gosh's power inside that realm. Find out where the flamegate leads!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Fang of Lo'Gosh}}

== Completion ==
Ah, you are the champion Lo'Gosh promised! Your eyes don't deceive you: you have entered the Firelands, an elemental plane of molten stone and fire. We've got our work cut out for us here.

Put aside your differences with the Alliance, there's plenty of danger to go around.

And take this: the Fang of Lo'Gosh will allow you to channel the ancient's power here within the Firelands. Use it well!

== Notes ==
If players should somehow drop/lose this quest, Takrik offers it back at the shrine, just in case. The flamegate is at the southwest corner of the [[Lightning Ledge]] at {{co|26.1|41.2|Mount Hyjal||1}}. Players drop down to the [[Firelands Forgeworks]] in the [[Firelands]]! {{NPC||Jordan Olafson}} and {{NPC||Yargra Blackscar}} await.
