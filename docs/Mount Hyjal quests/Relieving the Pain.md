==Objectives==
Obtain 4 Flame-Wreathed Hearts from [[Seething Pyrelord|Seething Firelords]].
*[[Flame-Wreathed Heart]] (4)

==Description==
The Arch Druid has an immense tolerance for pain. I've treated burn victims that spend twenty-two hours a day screaming in pain, and their burns weren't even half as bad as what [[Hamuul Runetotem|Hamuul]] has suffered.

Nevertheless, I can sense that he is in greater discomfort than normal today. Bring me the hearts of the large [[fire elemental]]s to the southeast. I can use them to prepare a soothing salve for our patient.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x1 and {{cost|9|40}}
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|165400}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
These hearts will give us exactly what Hamuul needs to rest.

==Completion==
I must get to work preparing the salve immediately. These reagents lose their efficacy by the minute.

Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Protectors of Hyjal]] before heading out. The pyrelords are elites at [[Sethria's Roost]] and are more easily killed with a party of NPCs helping.

==Progression==
