==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Marion Wormwing.jpg|Marion Wormwing|Just lure her out and start fighting. I'll sneak up behind her and take care of the rest.}}
Extinguish a Harpy Signal Fire to get the attention of Marion Wormwing. Fight her until {{NPC||Thisalee Crow||Thisalee}} subdues her, then question the [[harpy]] matron.
*[[Marion Wormwing]] Captured
*Marion Wormwing Interrogated

==Description==
It's time to get to the bottom of this. We need to investigate the matron of these beasts, Marion Wormwing. We'll capture her alive. Here's the plan:

The Harpies communicate across [[Rim of the World|the ridge]] using a series of signal fires. If we extinguish one, Marion is sure to come investigate.

You fight her as a distraction while I sneak up behind and grab her. I'll leave the questioning to you. Let's get her, <name>!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Punishing Shoulders|Legplates of Persuasion|Pinpoint Choker}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
Marion used to visit the shrine here. {{NPC||Skylord Omnuron}} tried to give the harpies the benefit of the doubt, but I never trusted her.

==Completion==
So the harpies are tools of some sort of dragon - "{{NPC||Sethria}}."

But what are the dragons doing to those eggs? And what's this 'special' egg that Sethria wanted so badly?

This is beyond me, <name>. I've given a report to Skylord Omnuron - he'll know what to do next.

==Notes==
There are signal fires all over the ridge: 
{{Zone Map|zone=Mount Hyjal|notes=
{{Zone Map Note|32.9|46.5}}
{{Zone Map Note|35.6|47.3}}
{{Zone Map Note|36.5|44.7}}
{{Zone Map Note|38.3|44.2}}

On extinguishing a fire:
:{{text|say|Marion Wormwing|Step away from there, <class>!}}
Hold Marion in one place as Thisalee exits flight form behind her and walks up on her:
:{{text|say|Thisalee Crow|Gotcha Chickenlips! You'd best get talky, or I'll get stabby.}}
Initially, Marion says one of the following. Choose the soften her up option and she'll randomly choose another, followed by some commentary from Thisalee:
*You'll get nothing from me, <race>!
*Do what you will. My new masters will cave my name into your flesh before they execute you.
*<Marion sqaks loudly and glares at you.>
*Your cities will fall, <race>. You'll perish in the darkness of the new regime!
{{gossip|''<Soften her up.>''}}
*{{text|say|Thisalee Crow|We don't need to tell Omnuron about this.}}
*{{text|say|Thisalee Crow|Easy, <name>. We still need the info.}}
*{{text|say|Thisalee Crow|Hey, you don't waste any time.}}
*{{text|say|Thisalee Crow|There's more where that came from, Marion!}}
*{{text|say|Thisalee Crow|Brutal!}}
*{{text|say|Thisalee Crow|Wait, was I supposed to be the good cop?}}
*{{text|say|Thisalee Crow|I'm not sure that's strictly necessary.}}
To get some information, actually ask the question:<br />
{{gossip|''Why are you stealing eggs?''}}
:She asked for eggs. Eggs for her fiery hatchery in another realm.
:And one egg... a special egg... she sought more than any other.
{{gossip|''Who? Who are you giving the eggs to?''}}
:She of the skies, but also of darkness. Brood of the Earth Warden. Invincible!
{{gossip|''Brood of the Earth Warden... you answer to a black dragon? Give me a name!''}}
:Foolish <race>! There is a new order. Aviana is dead. DEAD! And never coming back.
:Tell that to the druids in the trees.
:Sethria will soon be the master of the skies, and she has made sure that Aviana will never be reborn. The egg is hers.
:You are too late.
{{gossip|''<Order Thisalee to kill the harpy.>''}}<br />
{{gossip|''&lt;Ask Thisalee to release the harpy.>''}}
;Kill: {{text|say|Thisalee Crow|You're my kind of <class>, <name>! We're finished with this filth.}}
;Release: {{text|say|Thisalee Crow|You're a better person than I, <name>. But I suppose the harpies are just pawns here.}}
;Then:{{text|say|Thisalee Crow|Meet me back at Aviana's Shrine, <name>!}}

Skylord Omnuron offers the followup, [[Fact-Finding Mission]], upon the completion of both this quest and [[A Prayer and a Wing]], the conclusion of the Aviana chain offered by {{NPC||Choluna}}.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Aviana}}
