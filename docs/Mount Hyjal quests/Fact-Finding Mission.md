== Objectives ==
Report to [[Thisalee Crow|Thisalee]] at the entrance to [[Sethria's Roost]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

== Description ==
The dragon [[Sethria]] must be stopped. We know that her roost is south of here, along the southern cliffs of Hyjal, but beyond that we know little else.

I have sent Thisalee on a fact-finding mission to Sethria's Roost. She specifically requested your help - evidently you made quite an impression with the young druid.

Meet Thisalee just beyond the tunnel leading to Sethria's Roost. And remember, this is a fact-finding mission - don't do anything crazy!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|1|95}}

== Completion ==
Ah, <name>! I was hoping to see you out here.

What, [[Skylord Omnuron|Omnuron]] calls this a 'fact-finding mission?' Bah! Facts are best found on corpses.

Let's do some damage.

== Notes ==
The entrance of the cave is at {{coords|33.4|67.0|Mount Hyjal}} at the southern end of the [[Flamewake]] east of the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]]. Thisalee is on the other side of the cave at {{coords|32.8|70.8|Mount Hyjal}}

Most of the quests here are to kill dragonkin, a boon to [[skinner]]s.  You may also have [[Blackened Dragonscale]]s drop as you skin.  If there are many non-skinners coming by to complete their quests, stay a while and skin as much as you can, of course taking into account any [[PvP]] mechanics.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Aviana}}
