'''[[Mount Hyjal]]''' is one of the two 80-82 level-up zones in ''[[Cataclysm]]''. Breadcrumbs come from Stormwind and Orgrimmar from the [[Hero's Call]] and [[Warchief's Command]] billboards, which send players to Moonglade. There, the breadcrumb [[As Hyjal Burns]] directs players to the zone, where the chain proper starts underneath [[Nordrassil]], the world tree, with [[Inciting the Elements]] and [[The Earth Rises]].

Hyjal is an extremely-phased directed-questing experience. Following the breadcrumbs from the end of one area to the start of the next leads to a full exploration of the zone in a natural progression. The only branching point is after [[#The Return of the Ancients|The Return of the Ancients]], when the [[#Shrine of Goldrinn|Goldrinn]]-[[#Grove of Aessina|Aessina]]-[[#Awakening Tortolla|Tortolla]] portions loosely form one sequence, while [[#Shrine of Aviana|Aviana's]] section can be completed before, after, or in between them. Regardless, the storyline converges again at [[#The Ancients|The Ancients]] and is linear for the rest of the zone.

The other 80-82 level-up zone is [[Vashj'ir]]. The [[Vashj'ir quests|quest chain of Vashj'ir]] also starts from the Hero's Call/Warchief's Command billboards and drops players off in [[Kelp'thar Forest]].

The progression of the storyline in this zone is tracked in the achievement [[Coming Down the Mountain]].

After Mount Hyjal, the next zone is [[Deepholm quests|Deepholm]], which is started at the [[Earthen Ring]] earthshrines outside of [[Stormwind City]] and [[Orgrimmar]].
