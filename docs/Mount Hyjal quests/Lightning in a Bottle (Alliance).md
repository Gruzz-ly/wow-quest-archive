==Objectives==
Collect a Charged Condenser Jar from a Twilight [[Lightning Channel]].
*[[Charged Condenser Jar]]
*[[Totem of Goldrinn]] (provided)

==Description==
When I prayed at the shrine, [[Goldrinn]] granted me another vision. I saw you standing astride the [[Lightning Ledge]] with lightning in your hands. Goldrinn seems to feel that this is of the utmost importance, but I don't understand what the Ancient has planned...

<Name>, go to the Lightning Ledge. [[Twilight's Hammer]] has been running experiments with something called a "Lightning Channel." Investigate these channels, then use this totem to summon the Spirit of Goldrinn to see what he has in mind...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 4,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
We meet again, <class>. You carve a path of fear and confusion in your wake.

<Goldrinn's eyes twinkle expectantly.>

==Completion==
So, it is true! You indeed carry lightning in your hands.

You are the chosen one, <name>. You will be my champion, and carry my vengeance to realms where I cannot tread...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sweeping the Shelf (Alliance)|Sweeping the Shelf]] before heading out.

Head up to the ledge. While killing the natives, look for a lightning rod. Collect a condenser jar then use the totem to summon Goldrinn.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}
