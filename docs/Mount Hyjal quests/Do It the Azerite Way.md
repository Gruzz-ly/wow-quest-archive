==Objectives==
Return to the [[Chamber of Heart]].

==Description==
Incredible! Ye stopped the wound from spreadin' before it could get out o' control!

Let's get back tae the Chamber o' Heart, an' see if we can put any o' that azerite ye absorbed tae good use.

Do ye feel that, champion?

Yer [[:Heart of Azeroth]] is practically glowin'! I think ye may have absorbed somethin' special from the [[:azerite]] here at [[Nordrassil]]!

Let's go back tae the Chamber of Heart and sort it out. There's no tellin' what ye might discover!
