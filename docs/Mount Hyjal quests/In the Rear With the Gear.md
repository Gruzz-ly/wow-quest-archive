== Objectives ==
Collect 36 Twilight Supplies left behind from freed {{NPC||Twilight Slave (Mount Hyjal)||Twilight Slave}}s.
*[[Twilight Supplies]] x36

== Description ==
Prisoners of the [[Twilight's Hammer]] are forced to lug around sundries for the war effort, like common pack animals. I want those supplies, and if we can free a few poor souls from the Hammer's shadowy grip, all the better.

Kill the slave drivers along the road to our south and nearby slaves should make a break for it.

Search the packs they leave behind for anything valuable, and destroy anything you can't carry.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Repurposed Twilight Girdle|Rust-Scrivened Leggings|Sharptooth Signet}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Have you created some havoc down there, <name>?

== Completion ==
<Jadi kicks open one of the crates and picks up a curved dagger within. She immediately winces in pain.>

Augh! Cursed - this metal is cursed - it bites!

<When the dagger falls to the ground, it shatters, as if made of brittle glass.>

What demented workmanship is this? <Name>, I've never fought any foe like this before.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Harrying the Hunters]] and [[End of the Supply Line]] before heading out. Kill the proveditor and the slavemaster to free three slaves, each with three bags of supplies.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}

==Trivia==
