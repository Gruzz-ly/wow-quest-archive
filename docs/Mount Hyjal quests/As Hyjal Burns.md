==Objectives==
Fly to [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]] using {{NPC||Aronus}} and speak to {{NPC||Ysera}} once you're there.

==Description==
<Name>! We've heard much about you and your previous accomplishments.

It is good that you've come here just as [[Azeroth]] finds itself in a time of great need.

{{NPC||Deathwing}}'s minions are attacking Hyjal and seek to bring the destructive {{NPC||Ragnaros}} back into our world.

Aronus will take you to join {{NPC||Malfurion Stormrage||Malfurion}}'s forces in Hyjal. Lend them what help you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|90}}
*9,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Ysera appears to be in some sort of trance.>

==Notes==
Hop on. Aronus will take an Emerald Portal to the [[Scorched Plain]] on the lower portion of Hyjal, which has been wiped out.
:{{text|say|Aronus|No... it can't be. Our forward outpost has been obliterated!}}
:''Aronus then heads south toward [[Sulfuron Spire]], where Deathwing is hovering.''
:{{text|say|Aronus|Is it too late? I feel Deathwing's presence nearby!}}
:''As Aronus closes in on Deathwing, the former aspect pours his fire breath into the lava, from which Ragnaros spawns!''
:{{text|yell|Ragnaros|BY FIRE BE PURGED!!!!}}
:''Panicked, Aronus flies away, heading to Nordrassil.''
:{{text|say|Aronus|The Firelord has risen! We must send word to the others. Let us hurry!}}

Players are dropped off just outside a building which has been erected over the [[Well of Eternity (Hyjal)|Well of Eternity]]. Ysera awaits inside.

Better do this quest immediately! If you get out of Moonglade without jumping on Aronus, or get out of Hyjal before you turn in the quest, you have no easy way to get to Aronus in Moonglade unless you are a druid, as the portal from your capital city will no longer be offered. You will have to fly there manually. However, after you turn in this quest, a two-way portal to [[Orgrimmar]] or [[Stormwind City]] will open at the [[Nordrassil Inn]] entrance, enabling you to enter and leave Hyjal at any moment.

==Progression==
{{Nordrassil}}
