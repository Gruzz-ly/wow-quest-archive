== Objectives ==
Get and equip a [[:Twilight Firelance]] using the rack behind {{NPC||Farden Talonshrike||Farden}}. Mount one of {{NPC||Aviana's Guardian}}s and fly her to the Guardian Flag on the ledge below. Press the flap button to flap your mount's wings!

== Description ==
<Name>, our enemy is using [[Firelands Hatchery|this grotto]] in the [[Firelands]] to prepare an invasion. We're going to hit them hard right where they live.

But first, you'll need to get your wings. Flight in the Firelands does not work as it does in the outside world. Something about the dense, superheated air. You'll need some practice!

Get a Twilight Firelance from the rack behind me, equip it, then mount one of Aviana's Guardians. Practice flying - flap your wings! Visit a flag placed on the ledge below and return. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

== Progress ==
Do you feel comfortable flying yet?

== Completion ==
Well done! How does it feel?

It is challenging to master flight in this burning wasteland, but it is the only way.

I hope you're ready for battle, <name>...

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|bossemote|Grab a Lance from the Racks}}
Snag one. Then:
:{{text|bossemote|Equip the Lance}}
Equip it. Then:
:{{text|bossemote|Mount One of Aviana's Guardians}}
Mount it. Then:
:{{text|bossemote|Press Flap to Flap Your Wings!}}
The guardian has one ability:
*{{abilities|Flap|Flap your mount's wings. Flap repeatedly to gain altitude and momentum!|notes=Instant. No GCD.|cd=0.25 sec}}
There are three flags on lower islands. Land on any one of them. Then:
:{{text|bossemote|Flap Your Wings Rapidly to Re-Gain Altitude!}}

This area is Blizzard's shrine to the classic arcade game [[wikipedia:Joust (video game)|Joust]]. Joust is all about flapping at the right time to maintain momentum and altitude. And crashing into enemies to take them out...

There are no enemies at this point, so take as much time to practice to get a feel for it as necessary. At the very bottom of the pit is {{NPC||Numa Skyclaw}} who has some spare guardians in an emergency.

It is not necessary to dismount to interact with Farden to complete the quest and continue the next, so stay on to get ready for [[Wave One]].
