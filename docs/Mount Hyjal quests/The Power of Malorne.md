==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Galenges.jpg|Galenges, the Unbreakable|Wait for Malorne to attack, then unload on him!}}
Use the Guardian's Staff to summon and defeat Galenges.
*[[Galenges]] slain
*[[Guardian's Staff (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Matoclaw's voice continues.>

The portal that opened up to our east is guarded by a powerful [[flamewaker]] by the name of Galenges. We will need all of [[Malorne]]'s help in defeating him.

Do you remember the staff that I gave you? Place it in the pile of ash in front of the portal. Then pray that Malorne comes to your aid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 and {{cost|9|40}}
*69400 XP (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*+250 reputation with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Galenges has fallen, the unbreakable is broken... but our work is not done.

==Notes==
This quest is automatically offered upon completion of [[Between the Trees]]. Head east past the flamegate to see a glowing Pile of Ash at {{co|41.7|56.1|Mount Hyjal}} on the ground in front of some curiously burnt trees and a glowing portal. Place the staff. Galenges is a level 85 elite flamewaker with 1.3 million health, who immediately shatters the staff and starts attacking whoever placed it. A few seconds in, one of Malorne's ghostly spirit fragments will appear, weakening Galenges. Take this opportunity to quickly finish him off.

Galenges has the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Melee|notes=3600-4700 on cloth}}
*{{abilities|Focused Strikes|range=Melee|Slices rapidly at the enemy for 5 sec.|notes=Channeled. Repeatedly triggers...}}
**{{abilities|Focused Strike|range=Melee|Slices rapidly at the enemy, dealing 50% weapon damage.|notes=Instant}}
The Spirit of Malorne has the following ability:
*{{abilities|Antlers of Malorne|range=100|Charge at Galenges, increasing damage taken by 900% and reducing side by 30% for 10 sec.|notes=Instant.}}

On placing the staff:
:{{text|yell|Galenges|Which one dares to challenge Galenges? Stand forward, weakling!}}
:''Galenges destroys the staff and opens himself up to attack.''
:{{text|yell|Galenges|You stand no chance against me!}}
:''A stag comes, weakening him.''
:{{text|bossemote|Galenges is weakened by Malorne's Antlers! Attack him now!}}
:{{text|yell|Galenges|Ahh! What is the meaning of this!?}}
Victory:
:{{text|yell|Galenges|A noble effort... but it will take more than one of your puny stags to take down Galenges, the UNBREAKABLE!}}

Should players defeat Galenges before he is weakened a second time, they will complete the Galenges step of [[Infernal Ambassadors]].
