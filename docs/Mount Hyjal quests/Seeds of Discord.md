==Objectives==
Distract [[Karr'gonn]] and slay Dark<!-- sic --> Cultist Azennios at the [[Seat of the Chosen]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].
*[[High Cultist Azennios]] slain
*[[Ogre Disguise]] (provided)

==Description==
According to the intelligence you acquired, there is major friction between the ogres and non-ogres in the [[Twilight's Hammer|cult]].

High Cultist Azennios and the [[ogre mage]] Karr'gonn are meeting at the Seat of the Chosen in an attempt to ease the conflict.

There is an [[Ogre Outhouse|outhouse]] like this one at the Seat of the Chosen. Go there and put on this ogre disguise. Find a way to kill Azennios while he's in this mission of peace.

We must exploit this division as much as we can!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
Is it done yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Excellent job, <name>! You've outdone yourself this time.

==Notes==
Head northwest to the Seat of the Chosen. At {{coords|77.4|48.1|Mount Hyjal}} is the Ogre Outhouse. Use the Ogre Disguise at the outhouse to put on the ogre disguise, then walk in to the big building where Karr'gonn at {{coords|76.6|49.1|Mount Hyjal}} and High Cultist Azennios are talking. Talk to Karr'gonn:
:Yeah? What's the matter?
{{gossip|Boss, one of the boys is causing some trouble outside.}}
:{{text|say|Kar'gonn|What? I'll show that pipsqueak!}}
:{{text|say|High Cultist Azennios|I've got a bad feeling about this.}}
:''Karr'gonn walks out. Azennios goes neutral, and can be attacked and killed while in costume. After his death, Karr'gonn runs back in.''
:{{text|say|Karr'gonn|Curses! Who killed the human!? This is not good!}}
