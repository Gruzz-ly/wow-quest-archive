== Objectives ==
Collect 4 heaps of Core Hound Entrails.
*[[Core Hound Entrails]] x4

== Description ==
I was stunned to discover that [[Twilight's Hammer]] had located - and imprisoned - the great turtle ancient [[Tortolla]]. As we speak he is chained above the murky waters of the [[Ashen Lake]].

Freeing Tortolla from his bonds will not be easy. But we will take it one step at a time.

Head into the [[Flamewake]] and collect for me heaps of [[core hound]] entrails. I will explain why later.

And beware of [[Nemesis]] the Usurper while you are there! His time will come, but we are not yet prepared.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Gore-Stained Shoulderpads|Gutrip Gauntlets|Calcified Gizzard}}
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Have you collected the innards?

Core hounds are not native to this part of the world, they accompanied Twilight's Hammer from the nether regions of the earth. Do not trouble yourself over their elimination.

== Completion ==
Very good. We will need these to act as bait while they are still warm.

Here is my plan...

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Durable Seeds]] and [[Firebreak]] before heading out. Head northeast into the [[Flamewake]] -- much more target-rich environment.

==Progression==
{{Sanctuary of Malorne}}
