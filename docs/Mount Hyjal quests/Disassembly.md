== Objectives ==
Use Thisalee's Shiv to awaken and kill 3 Twilight Juggernauts. The shiv can be used multiple times to tear down a Juggernaut's armor.
*[[Twilight Juggernaut]] slain x3
*[[Thisalee's Shiv]] (provided)

== Description ==
We have to stop these juggernauts before they're completely encased in armor. Right now they're vulnerable, but only if we pry aside the plates and hack at the marred flesh beneath.

Take my shiv, and jam it between the plates of armored juggernauts to deprive them of their armor.

Once they break from their trance, you're in for a tough fight - keep prying loose that armor and stop those juggernauts!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Nimble-Knife Chestguard|Bladerip Girdle|Discarded Juggernaut Plating|Claw of Corroded Hope}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Oh good.

You're still alive.

== Completion ==
That was some fancy bladework, <name>!

There's one less threat for us to worry about in Hyjal.

== Notes ==
The shielded dragonkin are the targets this time. Open up with a shivving then attack as normal. Use the shiv again to speed the process by dropping some of the shield.  Each use of the shiv removes one stack.
