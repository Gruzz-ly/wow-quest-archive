== Objectives ==
Fight the waves of [[Charred Invader]]s on [[Nordune Ridge]] until the portal is opened.
*Open the portal to the Firelands.

== Description ==
We appear to have everything under control. Our invasion portal to the Firelands will be opened momentarily, and the elementals have not put up much fight.

Assist our druids by dispatching the last few of these elementals. Then, once the gate has been opened, we can make our move.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*69400 XP (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

== Progress ==
Continue the fight, <name>. Only a short while longer now.

== Completion ==
[[Leyara]]... she lives. I sense [[Fandral Staghelm|Fandral]]'s hand at play here...

== Notes ==
A progress bar will appear on accept and must reach 105 before completing. This appears to be timed, and not tied to kills. The NPCs can handle the invading fire elementals easily on their own, but help out to potentially speed up the process. Once the objective is complete, a voiced script event starts!
:''Leyara walks out of the portal.''
:{{text|yell|Hamuul|Druids, hold your fire! She is unarmed!}}
:{{text|yell|Malfurion|Wait a moment... I know that girl. Leyara, is that you?}}
:''The friendly NPCs run up to her.''
:{{text|yell|Leyara|Minions of the Firelord, lay waste to these invaders! The Guardians of Hyjal shall burn for their arrogance!}}
:{{text|yell|Leyara|You will all suffer the wrath of Ragnaros!}}
:{{text|yell|Leyara|DIE!!!}}
:''Leyara turns attackable by opening with a Fire Nova that hits for 20,000 Fire on players and 300,000 on NPCs, one-shotting all but the named elites. Leyara has 5.4 million health, but the NPCs hit hard. When she is nearly defeated...''
:{{text|say|Leyara|No matter. I shall watch Hyjal burn from afar.}}
:''Leyara shifts into flight form, taking the form of a phoenix.''
:{{text|say|Hamuul|A [[Druids of the Flame|flame druid]]... she is dangerous, Malfurion. You know her?}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion|Yes, Hamuul. And she's more dangerous than you know.}}
Speak to Malfurion to continue.
