== Objectives ==
Take [[Pip's Mole Machine]] to [[Blackrock Mountain]].
*Take Pip's Mole Machine to Blackrock Mountain.

== Description ==
[[Raz Skullcrusher|Raz]] and I were enlisted by the [[Guardians of Hyjal]] to investigate the re-emergence of [[Ragnaros]] into our world. Let me go ahead and confirm that he is back and he is angry! We also have evidence that these [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists are moving elementals from here to [[Blackrock Caverns]], over in the [[Eastern Kingdoms]].

Raz and I were about to head over there to investigate. We've got room for another in the mole machine if you're interested. Just meet us on the inside and we'll begin our journey.

== Progress ==
HELP! HELP!

== Completion ==
Oh dear, Raz has been captured! As soon as we entered a dozen cultists and [[Rom'ogg Bonecrusher|some big fat ogre]] jumped us. I ran while I Raz tried to fight them off. We need to save him, <name>!

== Notes ==
The mole machine is found to the left of Raz, down the ruins. Using the mole machine will transport you just outside the [[Blackrock Caverns]] in [[Blackrock Mountain]].
