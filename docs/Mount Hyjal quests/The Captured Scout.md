== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Scout Larandia}} at the [[Twilight Command Post]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

== Description ==
I've heard about you, <name>, and the news you brought from the south. The battle has reached a stalemate.

One that I fear is about to be broken by the {{NPC||Ragnaros||Firelord's}} reawakening.

That is unless we tip the scales in our favor in some way.

There is a scout that was captured by the [[Twilight's Hammer]]. I believe she was in possession of valuable intelligence. Find her in the Twilight camp to the west.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|3|90}}

== Completion ==
Help has arrived at last!

== Notes ==
Head west along the road from the ruins to reach the [[Twilight Command Post]]. Larandia can be found in a cage at the north end of camp.

==Progression==
{{Nordrassil}}

==Patch changes==
