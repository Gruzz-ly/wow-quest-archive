== Objectives ==
Return to {{NPC||Choluna}} at the [[Shrine of Aviana]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

Aviana's Egg should have arrived safely back at the Shrine. You should go check on it! Choluna should know how to handle this.

I'll finish the last of our business here and catch up with you later.

== Rewards ==

== Completion ==
<Name>! Is it true you led an assault against a [[twilight dragon]]?

You are truly a herald of the ancients!
