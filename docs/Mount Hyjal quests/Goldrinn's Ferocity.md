== Objectives ==
Acquire 6 Polluted Incense.
*[[Polluted Incense]] x6

== Description ==
The {{NPC||Lycanthoth Vandal||beasts}} you see here, they're no longer my brothers from [[Gilneas peninsula|Gilneas]]. They've been corrupted by some kind of madness, and they've taken over the shrine.

They came when the [[Twilight's Hammer]] arrived in Hyjal, and they howl the name of some [[Blasphemy|blasphemous]] mockery of our beloved {{NPC||Goldrinn}}. Forget about me - your first duty is to destroy these vandals before they continue to defile [[Shrine of Goldrinn|the shrine]].

As you destroy them, look for the incense they carry and bring me some samples.

== Rewards ==
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Worgen like myself were drawn to the story of Goldrinn, his strength and his wisdom. But these vandals - they worship a different aspect of the wolf gold entirely.

== Completion ==
<Ian examines the incense.>

As I suspected. These reagents bear the mark of the Twilight's Hammer. And here, the name "{{NPC||Lycanthoth}}." I believe these are used in a summoning ritual...

== Notes ==
Head north 30 yards and start killing.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
