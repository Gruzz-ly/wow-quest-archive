== Objectives ==
Return to {{NPC||Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem}} at the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
I slumbered in the healing silt of Hyjal.<br/>
I slept until the world broke open.<br/>
When the others came, I was not ready.

I am ready now, <race>.

My children and I. Slow to anger.<br />
But our wrath is final.

Tell those who sent you that we are prepared for war.

The others will be cast from the mountain.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|15|60}}

== Completion ==
<Name>!

You were able to earn the ancient's trust?

Wonderful! We are one step closer to taking back this mountain...

== Notes ==
Head back south across the lake. This concludes the Sanctuary of Malorne chain.

On complete, the Vision of Ysera appears:
:{{text|emote|A vision of Ysera materializes before you.}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Ysera|So Tortolla has risen to fight at our side. You are wise, <name>; it is difficult to earn that ancient's trust. He will be a stalwart companion.}}
If players have not already done the [[Shrine of Aviana]] chain after the [[Shrine of Goldrinn]], she offers [[Aviana's Legacy]] again.
