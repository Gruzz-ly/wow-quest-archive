== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Elementalist Ortell}} at [[Darkwhisper Pass]].

== Description ==
Only once has there been a leader capable of commanding [[demigod]]s and [[mortal]]s alike.

His name was {{NPC||Jarod Shadowsong}} and his ability to lead in battle was such that {{NPC||Cenarius}} and the other Ancients placed themselves under his command.

He disappeared for years and his whereabouts were unknown. Until now.

Our scouts believe he is being held captive inside a [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight]] camp in [[Darkwhisper Gorge]].

Your job is to infiltrate their ranks and free Jarod. Speak to the one known as Ortell at [[Darkwhisper Pass]] to the southeast.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

== Completion ==
Hey there. I'm glad to see they sent someone of your caliber for this operation.

This here's going to call for some subtlety. We can't risk Commander Shadowsong getting killed.

== Notes ==
Fly southeast of Nordrassil to the third [[flamegate]] in the [[Scorched Plain]], then keep heading east along the road. Inside the pass at {{coords|71.2|58.1|Mount Hyjal}} is Ortell, who has relocated from [[Ortell's Hideout]] in [[Silithus]]!

==Progression==
{{Darkwhisper Gorge}}
