==Objectives==
Use the Fang of the Wolf atop the corpses of 10 [[Firelands]] invaders within the [[Regrowth (subzone)|Regrowth]].
*Howl atop an invader's corpse x10
*[[Fang of the Wolf]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[wolf]] [[Ancient guardian|ancient]], [[Lo'gosh]] - or, if you prefer, [[Goldrinn]] - has many weapons available to him, but always the most underestimated is his howl. Today, we will use this weapon to summon and defeat [[Lylagar]], one of the [[lieutenant]]s of flame that lurk within the Firelands.

Defeat any of the creatures of flame within the Regrowth, and then use the Fang of the Wolf while standing atop their corpse. Soon, your howl will echo across all of [[Kalimdor]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x1
*52050 XP (or {{cost|12|40|50}} at max level)
*+150 reputation with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
The wolf also lives by fang, claw, and fleet of foot. It is easy to see how the howl is forgotten.

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Matoclaw.jpg|Matoclaw|Your howl is inspired, friend.}}
<Matoclaw's familiar voice enters your consciousness.>

Yes, <name>, you are ready. Now, we strike against Lylagar.

==Notes==
Same hostile mobs as other kill-quests in this series. Make sure to stand on their corpse and use the fang before moving on. Do this for 10 and the quest completes automatically.

Mobs at [[Sethria's Roost]] count as well.

==Progression==
