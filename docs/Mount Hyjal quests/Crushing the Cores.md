== Objectives ==
Acquire 8 Smoldering Cores by killing {{NPC||Searing Guardian}}s, then smash them against a [[Twilight Anvil]].
*[[Smoldering Core]] Destroyed x8

== Description ==
These searing guardians are murderous! We destroy them, and within minutes, they reignite from the ashes.

I think there's a way to destroy them permanently, but we'll need someone who can fight through the front ranks.

<Name>, kill the searing guardians and take their smoldering cores to the nearby anvils. Smash them on the Twilight Anvils, and destroy them for good!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Coreforged Girdle|Anvilcrush Bracers|Drape of Smoldering Dreams}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Are they dead?

It seems like nothing we do can cool this inferno...

== Completion ==
Great work!

There was a time when adventurers would [[Lava Core|collect]] these [[Fiery Core|cores]] in order to craft mediocre [[Lokhtos_Darkbargainer#Reputation_recipes|fire-resistant equipment]]. But for now, I'm glad just to destroy these fiends once and for all.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Forged of Shadow and Flame]] and [[Rage of the Wolf Ancient]] before heading out. Kill searing guardians and loot their Smoldering Cores. Find an anvil at {{co|29.2|42.7|Mount Hyjal||1}} on the right side of the path heading southeast toward the forgemaster and use the cores near the anvil to destroy them.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}
