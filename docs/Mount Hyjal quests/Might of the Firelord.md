==Objectives==
Slay 4 Flame Ascendants and 5 Twilight Subjugators at the [[Ascendant's Rise]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].
*[[Flame Ascendant]] slain (4)
*[[Twilight Subjugator]] slain (5)

==Description==
I've been charged with leading our military operations against the enemy. A humbling task when you consider there are [[demigod]]s walking among us.

I'm going to have you carry out a series of hit-and-run attacks behind enemy lines. It will be important that you keep the enemy off guard and weaken their numbers ahead of our main force's attack.

Your first target will be the Ascendant's Rise, where the most highly trained [[Twilight's Hammer]] devotees have achieved a partial elemental state.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Flamesear Leggings|Subjugator's Shoulderguards|Gauntlets of Guerilla Fury}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
What news do you bring, <name>?

==Completion==
You did well, <name>. I've a new target for you.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Secrets of the Flame]] before heading out. Take a left out of the gates and turn south before reaching Sulfuron Spire to get to the Ascendant's Circle. While killing subjugators and ascendants, keep an eye out for the [[Pure Twilight Egg]], which can be found at {{coords|59.1|83.9|Mount Hyjal}}on a cart near the southern end of the rise. It begins [[The Twilight Egg]].

==Progression==
{{Darkwhisper Gorge}}
