==Objectives==
Slay 8 Twilight Stormcallers and 5 Howling Riftdwellers.
*[[Twilight Stormcaller]] slain (8)
*[[Howling Riftdweller]] slain (5)

==Description==
Wonderful work in [[Gar'gol's Hovel|the hovel]], <name>. I prayed at the shrine while you were away, and in my visions, [[Goldrinn]] was watching you closely.

But we've been on the defensive too long: it's time to foil the [[Twilight's Hammer]] directly.

Fly up to the [[Lightning Ledge]] and disrupt their operation. Kill the stormcallers and the monstrosities they're preparing to unleash!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Bracers of the Forlorn Wolf|Wolfcall Stompers|Belt of Binding Purification|Rage of Lo'Gosh}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
The battle heats up! How goes it?

==Completion==
You should've seen the battle from here! Bodies were falling off of the cliff! Spectacular!

==Notes==
Don't worry about killing all of these and turning in before doing the [[Lightning in a Bottle]] chain. One less needless run across the valley.

Also, keep an eye out for [[Leyden Copperkleist]]. He guards an interesting book, [[The Condensation of Electra-Atrocity]].

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}
