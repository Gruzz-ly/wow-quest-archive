A character must have completed this quest in order to unlock the quests of the [[Firelands Invasion]].

==Objectives==
Take the Heart of the Forest to [[Hamuul Runetotem]] at the [[Grove of Aessina]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].
*[[Heart of the Forest (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<The finger-like branches of one of [[Nordu]]'s burning limbs part, revealing an untouched, glimmering seed.

This is the Heart of the Forest. The seed of life.

Take this to your Arch Druid at Aessina's Grove - Hamuul Runetotem will know how to invoke its power. I promise you, the wilderness spirit will be silent no longer. New life will bloom from the ashes of old.

Thank you, <race>. My time is done.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Rebirth Spaulders|Gloves of Nurtured Truth|Treads of Restoration|Chestplate of Viridian Renewal}}
You will receive: {{cost||78}}

==Progress==
I am at my wit's end, <name>! [[Aessina]] is silent.

Have you found something? What is this?

==Completion==
This is the key, <name>! With the seedlings you collected for me earlier, the animals you've saved from around Hyjal, and the Heart of the Forest you've just discovered, we can rejuvenate this land right from under the feet of [[Twilight's Hammer]]. Imagine their astonishment to see their work undone, as life triumphs over chaos...

I will begin the ceremony at once!

:{{text|say|Aessina|By your hand, this mountain will bloom again. It is yours to protect and defend.}}
:{{text|say|Aessina|See that it thrives. Drive out those who would do it harm. Do this in my name.}}
:{{text|whisper|Aessina|There will be no second chances, <race>.}}

:{{text|say|Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem|<Name>! You did it! I can't believe my eyes... the Inferno is gone... What has Aessina done!?}}
:''True to Runetotem's word, [[Inferno (subzone)|The Inferno]] and the [[Flamewake]] are no more, replaced by the [[Regrowth (subzone)|Regrowth]]. The Sanctuary of Malorne now has a statue of him.''
