This is the [[daily quest]] option for "jousting" in the [[Firelands Hatchery]]. It is essentially the same as [[Wave Two]] from the three-part jousting main quest series.

== Objectives ==
Equip a [[:Twilight Firelance]] and fly {{NPC||Aviana's Guardian}}. Kill 10 Twilight Lancers by flying into them. Press the flap button to flap your mount's wings! 
*[[Twilight Lancer]]s slain x10

== Description ==
The agents of Twilight continue their assault within this pocket of the Firelands. We must not let our offensive fall! Take wing, and destroy as many of those lancers as you can!

Do not forget to pick up and equip your lance first.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Our vigilance must not fall. Especially not now, in this most trying of times!

== Completion ==
Well done, <class>. I hope you don't forget about us here in the Hatchery. 

== Notes ==
Completing this daily quest ten times awards an achievement: [[The 'Unbeatable?' Pterodactyl: BEATEN.]]

If you leave the [[Twilight Firelance]] equipped when you turn the quest in, it will typically be removed from your inventory.  If you unequip it before turning the quest in, it typically will remain in your inventory.

There are several possible descriptions of the Daily Wave.  It is unknown if the name makes any difference.
* Lance in the pants!
* Lance with the devil in the pale Twilight!
* Hyjal kids, Hyjal wives!  They're lancing everyone in here!
* Lancer?  I hardly knew her!
* Get thee to a hatchery!
* Joust!

== Progression ==
{{Firelands jousting quests}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 4.1.0|note=Added.}}
