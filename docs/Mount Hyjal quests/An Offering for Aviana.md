== Objectives ==
Use the Sacred Nectar at Aviana's Burial Circle.
*Nectar Offered
*[[Sacred Nectar]] (provided)

== Description ==
Although the guardian of all winged creatures is no longer with us in body, I sometimes hear her voice in the whisper of swaying leaves.

<Name>, we ask much of you as you set out to preserve [[Mount Hyjal|this mountain]]. Before going on, take a moment to reflect.

Take this offering of nectar to {{NPC||Aviana}}'s burial circle, a circle of stones just outside the main door of the shrine. Perhaps some time alone with Aviana's memory will help sharpen your focus.

== Progress ==
<The spirit fades in and out of your vision, as though here and elsewhere at the same time.>

== Completion ==
<A whispered plea rings within your head.>

To be born again, but in darkness...

I have been stolen away.

<The spirit appears frantic, but falls silent as her image fades.>

== Notes ==
Aviana's Burial Circle is just outside the temple to the west at {{coords|40.3|44.3|Mount Hyjal}} with a few glowing golden butterlfies circling a font. Use the nectar to summon a {{NPC||Mysterious Winged Spirit}}.
