==Objectives==
Climb up trees in the [[Whistling Grove]], grab stranded Hyjal Bear Cubs, and then hurl them at the [[Soft Target]] from the top of the tree. This is perfectly safe.
*[[Hyjal Bear Cub]]s chucked to safety
*[[Inconspicuous Emerald]] (provided)

==Description==
Oh, raspberries! Just when we had saved the last bear cub from the treetops, the fires returned and scared them again!

I don't know if you know this, but baby bears are precious and soft.

Go to the Whistling Grove, far to the northwest. Climb the trees, grab the bear cubs, and chuck them - gently! - to the soft target in the center of the grove.

<Without warning, [[Mylune]] suddenly smashes you against her bosom and begins sobbing.>

Lil' b-b-b-baby bears! Save them, <name>!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x1
*52050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|12|40|50}} at max level)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
<Mylune gives you the big eyes.>

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Mylune.jpg|Mylune|Oh, yay!}}
<Mylune's thoughts echo in your mind, along with unwanted images of flowers and squirrels.>

Oh, you did it, <name>! The baby bears are so happy.

I'm beginning to think they've started doing this on purpose.

==Notes==
See [[The Bears Up There]] for more information on how to complete this quest.

The quest automatically completes once the sixth bear has safely landed on the soft target.

Mylune's bosom appears to be 10-12 feet off the ground.  That's a bit of a lift for any character other than a tauren.

==Progression==

==Trivia==
The quest is referenced and re-used in one of the [[Grand Hunt]]s in the [[Azure Span]] with the objective [[No Way Down]].
