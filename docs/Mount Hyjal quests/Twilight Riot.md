== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Jarod Shadowsong}} at the [[Gates of Sothann]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
I thank you for freeing me. Let us take advantage of the distraction you've created and get out of here.

We must hurry before the cultists catch on.

Meet me again when we've left this place.

== Completion ==
You have my thanks, <name>.

== Notes ==
Head to the island off the Gates of Sothann. Cenarius, Shadowsong, Ysera and two Emerald Drakes await.

On accept:
:{{text|yell|Elementalist Ortell|Yes, my bretheren! We are claiming this prisoner for the True Sons of the Twilight! These ogre scum are not fit to offer him as sacrifice! They are not worthy of the Old Gods' grace!}}
:{{text|say|Elementalist Ortell|Come on now commander. Let's get you out of here. <Name>, meet us at the Gates of Sothann -- {{NPC||Ysera}} awaits!}}
