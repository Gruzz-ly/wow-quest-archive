== Objectives ==
Slay 4 Twilight Field Captains.
*[[Twilight Field Captain]] slain x4

== Description ==
It looks like most of the [[Twilight's Hammer]] has fallen back to regroup for another assault. Their most dedicated are staying behind to hold the line. This is our chance to whittle away at their leadership.

Range out along the [[Scorched Plain]] and crush the Twilight Field Captains! We'll remove them from the equation!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
You've given our forces a second wind, <name>. How goes the fight?

== Completion ==
Terrific! Twilight's Hammer will no doubt try to re-take the mountain, but they'll have to do so without the leadership of those fat-for-brains thugs.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Hyjal Recycling Program]] before heading out. No followup, so head to the third flamegate.

==Progression==
{{Scorched Plain}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
