== Objectives ==
Seek out {{NPC||Nordu}}, an [[Ancient of Lore]], at the [[Flamewake]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

== Description ==
You have awakened the ancients, <name>, but the wilderness spirit {{NPC||Aessina}} remains silent. With her help, we can turn the tide of this attack and undo the damage [[Twilight's Hammer]] has done.

There may be one who can help us. The oldest of the trees, Nordu, stood in the center of what is now the Flamewake for thousands of years. His wisdom is as old as this mountain. If that old tree still lives, perhaps he can awaken Aessina... seek him out.

== Completion ==
I ... have not yet ... perished.

== Notes ==
Nordu is just north of the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]] on a rise east of {{NPC||Tortolla}}. He is being pestered by {{NPC||Fiery Tormentor}}s.

If you did not accept the quest from {{NPC||Ysera}} when she showed up at the [[Shrine of Aviana]] or the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]], you can find her back at [[Nordrassil]].

==Progression==
Requires: [[An Ancient Reborn]] and [[An Ancient Awakens]]
{{Scorched Plain}}
