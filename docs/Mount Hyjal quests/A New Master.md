==Objectives==
Use the Bottled Bileberry Brew on the corpse of a Twilight Inferno Lord, then speak with him.
*[[Twilight Inferno Lord]] Subjugated
*[[Bottled Bileberry Brew]] (provided)

==Description==
The potion you created is vile enough to wake the dead. Which is its intended purpose.

Slay a Twilight Inferno Lord and force the brew down his throat. He will revive, if only briefly, and be completely under your dominance.

Speak with him and learn the true name of the [[fire elemental]] he is channeling into [[Azeroth|the world]] to burn down your [[Mount Hyjal|precious forest]].

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|90}}

==Completion==
<The wretched creature before you speaks in a wavering voice, its body broken but briefly animated by Blackhorn's vile potion.>

Yes, master?

==Notes==
Find an Inferno Lord and kill it, then target its corpse and use the brew.

==Progression==
