== Objectives ==
Kill a {{NPC||Twilight Field Captain}} and recover the Glyph of Opening.
*[[Glyph of Opening]]

== Description ==
My {{NPC||Nemesis}}. Still lives.<br/>
The servants of fire still come.<br/>
We must pursue. Into their den.

The ogres know the way.<br/>
Slay the Field Captains.<br/>
Recover the Glyph of Opening.

This is the way.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
The glyph. Show it to me.

== Completion ==
This power is ancient.<br/>
Primitive.<br/>
Easy.

We will use it against them.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Breakthrough]] and [[Lost Wardens]] before heading out. While killing {{NPC||Twilight Scorchlord}}s and saving {{NPC||Lost Warden}}s, kill a {{NPC||Twilight Field Captain}} to loot his [[Glyph of Opening]] and return to {{NPC||Tortolla}}. Try to kill one early in the progress of the other quests so the trek back to Tortolla happens sooner rather than later.

==Progression==
{{Scorched Plain}}
