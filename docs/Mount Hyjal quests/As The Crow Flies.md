==Objectives==
Secure transport to the peak of [[Mount Hyjal]].

==Description==
I really should check in with [[Skylord Omnuron|Master Omnuron]] about this. However, you've been so helpful to the [[Druids of the Talon]] that I'll take a chance. I'm sure that he'll understand.

It's better to beg forgiveness than ask for permission anyway!

We'll leave now. You can't see the route we take to bypass the wards so I'll need to obscure your vision. This is irresponsible enough as it is and I definitely can't expose the secrets of the Druids of the Talon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Argent Dawn]]

==Completion==
Well, here we are.

I warn you, do not leave the immediate area of the summit. It will not go well for you. The [[druid]]s that guard [[Nordrassil]] are not always what I'd call friendly. There's also a whole mountain full of other horrors up here that would love to make a meal out of a nice juicy <class> like you.

I suggest you finish up here as quickly as possible and speak with me again when you are ready to head back down to [[Everlook]].

Good luck!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Thisalee Crow]]|You'd better hold on tight!}}

Speak to Thisalee on arriving in Hyjal:
{{Dialogue|You should be hasty, <class>. There are many creatures lurking up here that will quickly take interest in your presence. Some of which are my fellow druids. If they discover you here... well, it could get messy.

{{Gossip|Please fly me back to Everlook, Thisalee.}}
