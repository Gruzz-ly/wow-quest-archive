==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Flame Blossoms.
*[[Flame Blossom]] x5

==Description==
It is customary for new recruits to be sent on a difficult or sometimes impossible task. I was sent to obtain a [[black dragon]]'s scale; last year's instructors demanded a feather from a [[phoenix]].

Your lot has it relatively easy. Find me a handful of flame blossoms.

They grow around here in relative abundance. Oh, right. There will be a gigantic [[core hound]] roaming the fields to keep things interesting. Do your best to avoid him.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
Yes, <name>damus?

==Completion==
So you managed to pass this part of the test without getting yourself eaten by [[Smolderos the Carbonizer|Smolderos]] or being incinerated by the [[fire elemental]]s?

I suppose I should congratulate you on ascending the lowest rung of our ladder.

Well... congratulations, recruit!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Trial By Fire]] and [[Waste of Flesh]] before heading out. Plenty of Flame Blossoms are all over the area.

==Progression==
{{Darkwhisper Gorge}}
