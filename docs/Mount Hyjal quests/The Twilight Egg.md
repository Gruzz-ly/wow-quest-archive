== Objectives ==
Take the Pure Twilight Egg to {{NPC||Aronus}} at the [[Gates of Sothann]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].
*[[Pure Twilight Egg]] (provided)

== Description ==
The egg is unlike any that you've seen before. Its translucent shell appears to bend the light around it.

Accompanying it, you find a note describing the arrival of a fertile broodmother at the [[Ascendant's Rise]].

Perhaps you should show this to Aronus.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|31|50}}

== Completion ==
You were right to come tome with this, <name>. This represents a great threat to us if we do not act swiftly and boldly.

== Notes ==
On [[Might of the Firelord]] and [[Secrets of the Flame]], players are sent to the [[Ascendant's Rise]] on Mount Hyjal. The egg can be found at {{coords|59.1|83.9|Mount Hyjal}} on a cart near the southern end of the rise.

Aronus is next to Shadowsong and Cenarius at the gates.

==Progression==
