==Objectives==
Speak to [[Malfurion Stormrage]] at the [[Tranquil Grove]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

==Description==
<[[Ysera]]'s eyes look distant, as if not fully acknowledging you.>

I feel it as well, <class>. [[Ragnaros]] has arrived.

We must defeat his minions before he can join them and lend them his strength.

Seek Malfurion Stormrage at the [[Tranquil Grove]], west of here, and aid his forces in any way you can.

I must seek answers from within the [[Emerald Dream]]. You must protect the world tree until I return.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|95}}
*3,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You've arrived just in time, <name>.

==Notes==
Fly to the southwest out of the valley holding the world tree and follow the path toward the [[Verdant Thicket]]. Furion is just south of the road standing next to [[Windspeaker Tamila]] helping the [[Hyjal Warden]]s fend off [[Twilight's Hammer]] [[Twilight Vanquisher (mob)|vanquishers]] and [[Twilight Flamecaller|flamecallers]]. Furion says, before completing the quest:
:The forces we are up against go beyond the Twilight's Hammer, [[Ragnaros]] or even [[Deathwing]]. We must succeed here if our world is going to survive at all.
