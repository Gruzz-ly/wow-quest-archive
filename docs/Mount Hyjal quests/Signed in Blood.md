==Objectives==
Lure a [[Twilight Recruit]] away from the group and take his Twilight Recruitment Papers.
*[[Twilight Recruitment Papers]]
*[[Blackjack]] (provided)

==Description==
You're here at last, <name>. Just in time as well.

News of [[Ragnaros]]' emergence has spurred a large wave of recruits to seek membership in the [[Twilight's Hammer]].

If you're to infiltrate the cult, the time is now. We will need recruitment papers — signed in blood by a referring Twilight member. Lure one of the new recruits away from the group and hit them with this blackjack.

If you're lucky, you'll be able to steal his recruitment papers. Bring them back to me and we'll do our best to alter them.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
Did you get the papers?

==Completion==
Excellent. I'll do my best to alter these documents.

==Notes==
Run to the southeast along the road to come across a small group of Twilight Recruits under the watchul eye of [[Twilight Recruiter Maruk]]. Talk to one of the recruits to lure him or her away from Maruk and break out the Blackjack! It will take running back to the pass to get out of Maruk's sightline. The Blackjack will one-shot the recruit, so use it and loot the papers.
