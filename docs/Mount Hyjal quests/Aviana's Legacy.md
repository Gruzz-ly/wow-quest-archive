==Objectives==
Locate {{NPC||Choluna}} at the [[Shrine of Aviana]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

==Description==
Your expertise is needed elsewhere, <name>.

Just southwest of the [[Nordrassil|World Tree]] you will find the Shrine of Aviana, home to the [[Druids of the Talon]]. {{NPC||Aviana}}, the matron of all winged creatures, gave her life for this world [[War of the Ancients|ten thousand years ago]].

I sense her shrine is being threatened, as are the [[druid]]s who guard it. Seek out Choluna, one of the wisest of the winged druids, deep within the shrine.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|90}}

==Completion==
Ysera herself sent you to me? Oh! It's an honor to speak with a representative of the [[Dragon Aspects|aspects]].

It is true that our shrine is in jeopardy. The [[harpy|harpies]] we once sheltered in our boughs have suddenly turned against us.

But please, don't rejoin the fight until you are ready. Our shrine is no mere battleground. Use its peace and power to center yourself.

==Notes==
The Vision of Ysera offers this quest at the conclusion of the [[Shrine of Goldrinn]] chain, after [[Return from the Firelands]] and at the conclusion of the [[Sanctuary of Malorne]] chain, after [[An Ancient Awakens]]

The other post-Return from the Firelands quest is [[The Fires of Mount Hyjal]] which leads to the [[Grove of Aessina]]. There is no other post-An Ancient Awakens quest.
