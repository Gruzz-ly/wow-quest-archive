== Objectives ==
Stand by [[Malfurion Stormrage|Malfurion]] as he resurrects [[Malorne]].
*Protect Malfurion

== Description ==
Malfurion is working on a miracle for us. He believes that, in this time of peril, he can resurrect Malorne to protect [[Sanctuary of Malorne|the Sanctuary]]. I have faith in him.

In the meantime, we need to hold this perimeter. Stand by, and make sure no harm befalls my fellow arch druid.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x10
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

== Progress ==
Please, <name>. Focus on the task at hand.

== Completion ==
Malorne's strength alone may have just saved [[Kalimdor]]. To imagine, Malorne has returned today, after so long an absence...

<Malfurion surveys the area.>

We've taken heavy losses. Though the immediate threat is no longer present, our forces will need time to heal, and to put out any remaining fires here in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

Our attack on the [[Firelands]] will have to wait.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|bossemote|Stay by Malfurion's side while he summons Malorne!}}
:{{text|say|[[Matoclaw]]|The invaders are fast approaching, Malfurion! Give up this ritual and join the fight!}}
:{{text|say|Matoclaw|With your help, we can repel them!}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|No, Matoclaw.  [[Ragnaros]] will not be content to send mere foot soldiers to attack us.}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|I sense something larger is coming, and we will need the strength of Malorne if we are to survive.}}
:{{text|say|Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem|Have patience, Matoclaw.  The ritual is nearly complete.}}
:''[[Lord Rhyolith]], an elite [[magma giant]] appears in the distance!''
:{{text|yell|Matoclaw|[[Elune]]'s [[Moonlight|light]]... what is that thing?}}
:{{text|yell|Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem|Hold them back! We need to buy more time!}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Rhyolith|Buuurrnnnn!}}
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Hold the line! They must not break through!}}
:{{text|yell|Lord Rhyolith|Succumb to living flame!}}
:{{text|yell|Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem|Stand strong!  Only a bit longer!}}
:''Suddenly, Malfurion pulls through and resurrects Malorne! Malorne intercepts Lord Rhyolith, meleeing him for roughly 1 million Physical a swing, quickly defeating him. Job done, Malorne then runs off to the northeast.''

Speak to Malfurion to continue. This concludes the introduction. Now, dailies, and a collection quest for 20 [[Mark of the World Tree]].
