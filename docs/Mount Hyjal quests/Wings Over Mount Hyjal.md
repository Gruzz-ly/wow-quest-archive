== Objectives ==
Locate {{NPC||Choluna}} at the [[Shrine of Aviana]] in [[Mount Hyjal]].

== Description ==
<Name>, is it true you're going to try to commune with the ancients?

Southwest of here is the Shrine of Aviana, the matron of all flying creatures. It's the home of my favorite instructor, Choluna. I've never encountered one who was so deeply in touch with the spirits of this world. You could learn a lot from her!

The recent attacks have isolated the shrine. But it's easily accessible from the air - look for the second biggest tree on Hyjal. Good luck!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||78}}

== Completion ==
Oh, you were sent here by {{NPC||Tiala Whitemane||Tiala}}? A wonderful student, she'll do many great things.

Altough I sense even greater potential from you.

Please, stay a while in our shrine. There's much to do, but you can't accomplish anything with a troubled mind.

== Notes ==
This is one of the two breadcrumbs to the Shrine of Aviana. The other is [[Aviana's Legacy]], offered by the Vision of Ysera upon the conclusion of [[Return from the Firelands]] at the [[Shrine of Goldrinn]].

The Shrine is due south of the [[Verdant Thicket]]. Choluna is on the bottom floor of the tree all the way in the back. The Shrine is a fully-fledged town with innkeeper, flight master and vendors. Also just inside is {{NPC||Thisalee Crow}}, who offers [[The Wormwing Problem]] and [[Scrambling for Eggs]].

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Aviana}}
