==Objectives==
Speak to [[Skylord Omnuron]] at [[Malfurion's Breach]].

==Description==
Many of the [[Druids of the Talon]] have made their way to the [[Molten Front]], at your beckoning. You should go to Skylord Omnuron at Malfurion's Breach and see how their wings are faring in those burning skies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|35}}
*17350 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|41350}} at max level)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Completion==
These skies are indeed oppressive, but we've been able to navigate them for the most part.

We may need your help to secure additional landing territory past the [[Furnace]]. I will call for you when we are ready.

==Notes==
The innkeeper at the [[Shrine of Aviana]] offers this quest upon completion of [[Druids of the Talon (quest)]]. It is not required to advance the phase on the Molten Front, but free gold/rep/experience is nice to have. Make sure to pick it up before leaving the shrine!

The phase at Malfurion's Breach has advanced, if slightly. Several Druids of the Talon and Skylord Omnuron are standing near the path to the [[Furnace]], northwest of [[Malfurion's Breach]].

Complete the phase two daily quests and then the phase three daily quests will unlock for the day. Should players have both factions unlocked, they may complete ''either'' faction's chain of daily quests each day, not both.
