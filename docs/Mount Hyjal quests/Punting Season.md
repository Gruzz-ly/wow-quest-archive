==Objectives==
Punt 5 Children of Tortolla into water.
*[[Child of Tortolla]] punted into water (5)

==Description==
Baby turtles can be sweet, even if they can be somewhat bitey.

<[[Mylune]] holds up a bandaged finger.>

But they're so slow with their tiny little legs, they can't escape the [[fire elemental|fire creatures]] who are attacking [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]]!

<Mylune claps her hands together.>

PLEASE save them, <name>! Pick up the wee turtles and punt them into the water of the [[Ashen Lake]]. Don't worry about the kicking, they have hard shells.

They also have hard teeth, so don't pick them up by the mouth.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x1
*52050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|12|40|50}} at max level)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
So may tiny animals. And only so many hugs to give!

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Mylune.jpg|Mylune|Poor little shelly-shells...}}
<Mylune's voice echoes in your head, along with an unwanted image of playful kittens.>

You saved the wee turtles, <name>! I hope you gently, lovingly kicked them as hard as you possibly could.

==Notes==
Head northwest from base to see [[Child of Tortolla|Children of Tortolla]] being tormented by [[Flame Terror]]s. Kill the nearby hostiles and snag the child. Players will be put in a vehicle with two abilities:
#{{abilities|Punt Turtle|Punt the Child of Tortolla.|note=Instant.}}
#{{abilities|Drop Turtle|Put the Child of Tortolla back on the ground.|note=Instant.}}

This will cause permanent player pets to DESPAWN, and they do not respawn after the turtle is released. Plan accordingly for this!

Run to get a better shot at the [[Ashen Lake]] and then punt the turtle. The turtle must land ''in the water'' or it will not count.

The quest will complete automatically after the fifth turtle lands in the water.

Do note that the turtles have some considerable "hang time." Once you've punted the fifth turtle you'll have 10 seconds or so before quest complete. It's safe to start flying back as soon as you've punted. 

The Phrase "save the wee turtles" is a pop culture reference to a line from Groundskeeper Willie in the Simpsons.

While doing the quest, you can target one of the fire elementals with the punted turtle as a step for the [[achievement]] [[And the Meek Shall Inherit Kalimdor]].

==Progression==
