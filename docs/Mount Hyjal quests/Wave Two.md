== Objectives ==
Equip a [[:Twilight Firelance]] and fly {{NPC||Aviana's Guardian}}. Kill 10 Twilight Lancers by flying into them. Press the flap button to flap your mount's wings!
*[[Twilight Lancer]] slain x10

== Description ==
You've stirred up the hornets, <name>. The ceiling is coming down on us! And their strongest fighters are taking wing on creatures warped and twisted by this [[Firelands|world of flame]].

Get back out there and take them down! Watch out for flaming boulders.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
FLAP! For the love of all things merciful, flap. Flap harder!

== Completion ==
By the wings of {{NPC||Aviana}} - you were born to fly, <name>!

Quickly, let's get back out there and hit them again...

== Notes ==
New complications this round: Falling Boulders are dropping out of the ceiling! They hit for ~8000 damage, on a health pool of 37187. The guardian does regenerate health, but slowly. If your mount is wounded, you can also return to the starting area, dismount, and get on a fresh mount--the quest is not interrupted.
