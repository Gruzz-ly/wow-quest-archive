== Objectives ==
Return to {{NPC||Ian Duran}} at the [[Shrine of Goldrinn]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

== Description ==
I'll usher out the rest of {{NPC||Goldrinn}}'s followers and seal this portal behind us.

The rest of our forces at Mount Hyjal will want to hear of this victory. Return to Ian Duran and let him know what we've discovered and how we were triumphant!

Simply step through the portal to return to Mount Hyjal.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||78}}

== Completion ==
They're moving supplies to Hyjal straight from the [[elemental plane]]s? That explains so much.

You've made Goldrinn proud by sealing that flamegate, <name>, but there may be more portals to seal. You should check with the other shrines!

== Notes ==
Players are returned to the [[Lightning Ledge]] on the surface. Finish up [[Sweeping the Shelf]] if not already done and fly back to the shrine.

On complete:
:{{text|emote|A vision of Ysera materializes before you.}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Ysera|<Name>, you have unleashed the wolf ancient and defeated his shadow. Your actions already reverberate across the dream - thank you. But more remains to be done...}}

Her gossip text:
:<Ysera's image flutters before your eyes, as if in a dream. Nobody else sees her here, yet the vision senses your presence.>

She offers [[Aviana's Legacy]].

Also on completing this quest, [[Rio Duran]] offers [[The Fires of Mount Hyjal]].

==Progression==
