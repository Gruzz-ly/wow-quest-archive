== Objectives ==
Slay 6 Twilight Inferno Lords within [[Inferno (subzone)|the Inferno]].
*[[Twilight Inferno Lord]] slain x6

== Description ==
The firestorms up ahead are unbound [[elemental]]s in the purest form - something I didn't think could exist outside their [[Firelands|own plane]]. Only very skilled summoners could unleash something like this.

<Name>, head into the Inferno and seek out [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight]] Inferno Lords. They've got to be summoning in reinforcements as we speak. Silence them... For good!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ring of the Quenched Inferno|Lordbane Scepter|Firestorm Hackblade}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Tell me... you have found the fiends responsible for this?

== Completion ==
Dead? Good!

But it seems there's still so much to be done... fires to quench... and the soil to heal...

I hope you'll stay close to help us reclaim [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]]!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Fighting Fire With ... Anything]] and [[Save the Wee Animals]] before heading out.

The inferno lords are at the three Firestones...
