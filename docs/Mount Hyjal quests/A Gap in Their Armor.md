== Objectives ==
Gather 8 Twilight Armor Plates.
*[[Twilight Armor Plate]] x8

== Description ==
Do you see what they're doing here? They're affixing armored plates onto the [[Dragonkin]]. A page out of {{NPC||Deathwing||Deathwing's}} book, I suppose.

Those {{NPC||Twilight Juggernaut}}s look like they'll be invincible once they're complete. There's got to be a way around that armor plating!

Run out there and fetch some of the Twilight armor plates that are waiting to be installed. We'll figure out how to beat this.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Did you get a hold of some plates? Did you have to kill anyone to get them?

I hope so.

== Completion ==
Look at these things. Ugh, the runes make my eyes hurt. This one here is meant to sear flesh? Seriously? Ouch! Wait a minute...

These plates are designed to be riveted directly into flesh. The pain must be unbearable!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Sethria's Brood]] before heading out. Head south and start looking for plates on the ground. Keep an eye out for the Codex of Shadows at {{coords|31.3|77.1|Mount Hyjal}} too. It starts [[The Codex of Shadows]].

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Aviana}}
