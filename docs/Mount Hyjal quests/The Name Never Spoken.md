== Objectives ==
Assemble the true name by examining the three Firestones.
*[[Northern Firestone]] Examined
*[[Central Firestone]] Examined
*[[Southern Firestone]] Examined

== Description ==
We called upon the fury and the flame of the One, my former master.

[[Inferno (subzone)|The Inferno]] is by His design.

His true name is never uttered, it holds His power.

Each of us was told but a piece. Each piece engraved on a firestone.

The One's true name is here, in the Inferno. Seek the three stones...

== Progress ==
A name, <name>. We need a name.

== Completion ==
Yes, yes! Show me the runes you discovered.

"Vol'talo {{NPC||Thol'embaar}}." That's the name of your real enemy.

Presumably you're dealing with one of {{NPC||Ragnaros}}'s generals, sent here to scorch the [[Mount Hyjal|mountainside]] and pave the way for his conquest.

I will show you how to crush him.
