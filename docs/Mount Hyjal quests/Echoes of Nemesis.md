==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Nemesis.jpg|Nemesis|Portions of Nemesis' spirit still linger between our dimensions.}}
Speak with [[Tooga]] to summon and kill Nemesis. Stand under Tooga's shell to protect you from Nemesis' Molten Fury.
*[[Nemesis]] slain

==Description==
<Mylune's voice sings like a melody in your head.>

Remember that awful fire turtle, Nemesis, from the [[Firelands]]? He's dead now (yay!) but echoes of him keep trying to break through to [[Mount Hyjal]].

Go to the shores of the [[Ashen Lake]] and speak with my friend [[Tooga]]. Let him know you're ready to fight an echo of Nemesis, and the turtles will draw him into this world. Then you can hit him! Hard!

Hide inside of Tooga's shell if he starts to erupt.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x2 and {{cost|9|40}}
*69400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|16|54}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
So many animals in trouble. So few hugs to give!

==Completion==
Hooray! It just goes to show you, when a turtle puts his mind to something -

<Mylune is distracted by a butterfly and never finishes her thought.>

==Notes==
This quest is automatically offered upon completion of [[Punting Season]].

Head down to the [[Ashen Lake]]. Speak to Tooga, hiding behind a tree at {{co|24.1|55.7|Mount Hyjal}} to start the event:
:Are you ready to face Nemesis? I hope you have your totem ready.
:Let me know when you want to summon him.
{{gossip|I am prepared to face Nemesis, Tooga.}}

:{{text|yell|Tooga|NOW, YOUNG ONES! ATTACK THE PORTAL! FOR TORTOLLA!}}
:''Five Children of Tortolla attack the portal, summoning the echo of Nemesis.''

Nemesis is a level 85 elite with 232470 health. He has the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Basic melee|notes=~5000 Physical on cloth.}}
*{{abilities|Molten Fury|range=40|Nemesis EXPLODES with the volcanic fury of a hundred suns, damaging all enemies in a 40-yard radius.|note=7 sec cast. Uninterruptible. Hits for 45,000-55,000 Fire.}}

Molten Fury is telegraphed with the following boss emote:
:{{text|bossemote|Nemesis is about to erupt! Get under Tooga's shell!}}

Tooga will pop a glowing yellow shell bigger than he is. Run under it to go immune to Nemesis' Molten Fury, as it hits for 45,000-55,000 Fire. However, Tooga's shell also silences players and they will be unable to attack while immune.

Return to Mylune once he is dead.

Should players defeat Nemesis without taking any damage from Molten Fury, they will complete the Nemesis step of [[Infernal Ambassadors]].
