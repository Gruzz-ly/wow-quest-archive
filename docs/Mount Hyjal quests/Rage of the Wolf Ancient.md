== Objectives ==
Slay 12 Dark Iron Laborers.
*[[Dark Iron Laborer]] slain x12

== Description ==
Here we are deep within [[Firelands|the realm]] of the fire god and what do we find? The little puppets of {{NPC||Ragnaros}}, scurrying around to do his building.

These [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Iron]] laborers are finishing and packaging the weapons the [[Twilight's Hammer]] hopes to use in their conquest of [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]]. I don't care if they're here of their own free will or if they've been brainwashed or kidnapped... They're a foe of our beloved {{NPC||Goldrinn||Wolf Ancient}} and they should pay the ultimate price.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
It's okay to revel in the destruction of deserving foes, <class>. How goes the fight?

== Completion ==
Dead? Good. They sealed their fate when they threw in their lot with Ragnaros and his kingdom of flame.

Leave their bodies down here to crumble into ash.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Forged of Shadow and Flame]] and [[Crushing the Cores]] before heading out. Welcome back to the Burning Steppes and Blasted Lands.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Goldrinn}}

==Patch changes==
