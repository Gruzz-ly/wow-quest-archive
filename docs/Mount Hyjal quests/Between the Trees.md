==Objectives==
Catch three Spirits of Malorne by walking close to them.
*[[Spirit of Malorne]] captured x3
*[[Guardian's Staff]] (provided)

==Description==
Spirit fragments of [[Malorne]] - seen to us [[mortal]]s as ghostly white deer - still frolic through these forests. While Malorne is no longer with us, these pieces of his spirit may be of use to us.

Travel east and walk among the trees. If you are able to get close enough to one of the spirit fragments, it will bestow its power to you.

Oh, and take this staff. You may need it later.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*52050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|12|40|50}} at 85)
*[[Mark of the World Tree]] x1
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Guardians of Hyjal]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Matoclaw.jpg|Matoclaw|I can already sense the power of the stag within you.}}
<Immediately after touching the final spirit of Malorne, you hear [[Matoclaw]]'s voice.>

Well done, <name>. With the horns of Malorne on our side, we stand a chance against one of the Firelands' most difficult foes: Galenges.

==Notes==
Pale ghostly white stags are running around the area around the flamegate in the Regrowth faster than epic land mounts. Try to land in front of one and hope it doesn't randomly change direction. No need to do anything&mdash;like dismount&mdash;just be near it. This quest will automatically complete after collecting the third stag spirit.
