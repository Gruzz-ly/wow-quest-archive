== Objectives ==
Gather 8 Hyjal Eggs.
*[[Hyjal Egg]] x8

== Description ==
There's a pattern to these [[Wormwing]] attacks. While groups make a showy assault on the [[Shrine of Aviana|shrine]] itself, others swoop into the nearby nests and make off with eggs from all the flying creatures of [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].

These animals are under our protection. Before we find out why the Wormwing are doing this, it's up to us to rescue as many eggs as we can from their talons.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
<Thisalee is cleaning her nails with a dagger. She looks up at you expectantly.>

== Completion ==
Good, that's a start.

The birds who laid these eggs will never accept them again, so we'll have to raise these birds as orphans in the shrine here. Were {{NPC||Aviana}} here, she never would've let this travesty happen.

But on to business...

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Wormwing Problem]] before heading out. Go west and kill stuff. Look for eggs at the base of trees.

==Progression==
{{Shrine of Aviana}}
