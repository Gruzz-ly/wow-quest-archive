== Objectives ==
Slay 10 Raging Firestorms within [[Inferno (subzone)|the Inferno]].
*[[Raging Firestorm]] slain x10

== Description ==
[[The Inferno|The inferno]] raging up ahead marks the front line between us and the forces of the {{NPC||Ragnaros||Fire Lord}}. The [[fire elemental]]s unleashed here are unlike any I've ever encountered.

Can you help us stem the tide of destruction? Slay the raging firestorms... before they engulf [[Grove of Aessina|Aessina's Grove]] and erase all hope of someday reclaiming [[Mount Hyjal|this mountain]]!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
You're covered with soot. Are we winning the fight out there?

== Completion ==
Thank you, <name>. You've given us the opportunity to try to reclaim the upper hand.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Disrupting the Rituals]] and [[Save the Wee Animals]] before heading out. Fire elementals everywhere in the Inferno.

The title of this quest is an obvious reference to the English idiom [[Wiktionary:fight_fire_with_fire|"fighting fire with fire"]].

==Progression==
{{Grove of Aessina}}
