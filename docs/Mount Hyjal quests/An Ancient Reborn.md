==Objectives==
Use the Herald's Incense before Aviana's Egg at the [[Shrine of Aviana]].
*Herald's Incense Burned
*[[Herald's Incense]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm convinced that YOU are the herald of [[Aviana]], <name>. It was you who first saw her and rescued her essence from the claws of a dragon.

Yes, I believe Aviana is to be reborn into our world. And you shall have the honor of ushering her over the threshold.

Take this incense and burn it before Aviana's egg in the room just above me.

The ancient awaits, <name>. Our deliverance is here!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Skygrip Handguards|Heraldcall Censer|Signet of Fragrant Summoning}}

==Completion==
I ... live.

Those that tried to corrupt me and kidnap my children will soon feel the rake of my talons, <class>. Believe it.

Continue to push forward across Hyjal. I will collect myself and assemble with the other ancients.

==Notes==
Head upstairs to see Aviana's Egg. Use the incense to summon Aviana.

This concludes the primary Shrine of Aviana storyline. The Vision of Ysera materializes on complete:
:{{text|emote|A vision of Ysera materializes before you.}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Ysera|The guardian of the skies has taken flight again! This is encouraging news, <name>. But much remains undone, and we must turn our attention elsewhere...}}

If this is the last shrine to be completed, the Vision of Ysera will offer [[The Last Living Lorekeeper]], which leads to Aessina's Miracle. Otherwise, she will direct players to the shrine that has not been completed, which is probably Aessina+Malorne.

Once Aviana is reborn, [[Morthis Whisperwing]] offers an optional side-chain starting with [[The Hatchery Must Burn]], which sends players to the [[Firelands Hatchery]], which is only traversable by using [[wikipedia:Joust (video game)|Joust]]-inspired flying mounts&mdash;Spam the Flap button to gain altitude and momentum. Attack enemies by running in to them.
