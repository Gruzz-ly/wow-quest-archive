== Objectives ==
Obtain the Ascendant's Codex, the Burning Litanies and the Tome of Flame at the [[Ascendant's Circle]] in [[Mount Hyjal|Hyjal]].
*[[Ascendant's Codex]]
*[[The Burning Litanies]]
*[[Tome of Flame]]

== Description ==
If we are to banish {{NPC||Ragnaros}} back into the [[Firelands]], we will need to gain access to [[Sulfuron Spire]].

Only the most trusted members of the [[Twilight's Hammer]] will have been entrusted with such valuable information.

Go search the Ascendants' Circle for any written tomes you might find. Foul as they are, we cannot waste the opportunity to learn about our enemy's weaknesses.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Did you succeed in your task, <name>?

== Completion ==
These foul books should not be allowed to exist. Yet the information inside them is of vital importance.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Might of the Firelord]] before heading out. Take a left out of the gates and turn south before reaching Sulfuron Spire to get to the Ascendant's Circle. Also, look for the [[Pure Twilight Egg]] at {{coords|59.1|83.9|Mount Hyjal}} on a cart near the southern end. It begins [[The Twilight Egg]]
