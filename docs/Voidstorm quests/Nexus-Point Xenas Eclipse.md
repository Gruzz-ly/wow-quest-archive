:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|All this time, Lothraxion thought that my judgment had been compromised by the Void.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Now his zealotry threatens all of [[Silvermoon]].}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|I've seen this before. In the [[Scarlet Crusade]], in [[Turalyon|father]], even in myself.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Given who Lothraxion was before he embraced the Light...}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Maybe his conviction was the only thing that could anchor him in a place like this.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Perhaps. For a thousand years, I saw the Light bolster the resolve of its champions. But it also... changed them.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Lothraxion was obviously no exception. And neither was Turalyon.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|More than anything, that was what I feared for you, Arator. Not that you would come to harm, but that the Light would alter you forever.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|That in the face of peril, you, like Lothraxion, would lose yourself to wrath. Like I risk losing myself to the Void.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I... understand. But I promise you that it will never happen. Not for me, and not for you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|We're Windrunners, after all. No outside force has ever succeeded in telling us what to do.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Then let us save Silvermoon together. As Windrunners.}}

Complete the dungeon and head to the [[Approach]] with the party who is with [[Magister Umbric]].
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Keep your word, Decimus. Shut it down!}}

Speak with Decimus,
:{{Dialogue|Well done. Watching you fight is exhilarating as always.

Pity about your friend. Why are lightlings always so eager to throw their lives away?

{{Gossip|quest=|Play Movie=|Shut it down!}}
}}

A [[Midnight in-game cinematics|pre-rendered cutscene]] starts.

After that, Decimus has a new gossip
{{Dialogue|Ah, an army of lightlings against an endless swarm of Void. I'll enjoy watching this.}}
