==Objectives==
Recover Mementos from fallen vanguard soldiers.
*[[Fallen Vanguard's Memento]] (8)

==Description==
Our vanguard forces have been harrying the Devouring Host, probing for weaknesses and gathering intelligence.

Unfortunately, nearly all of them have succumbed to the host. We are too late to help those who have fallen, but perhaps we can gather something to remember them by.

Will you do this, <name>? Recover mementos of the fallen so they can be returned to those they fought to protect.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Voidbreaker's Clasp]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Cord]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Sash]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Waistguard]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*3,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered them yet? I'm sure these keepsakes will be a source of comfort to their loved ones.

==Completion==
A grim task, <name>. But one that may bring a small measure of comfort to those that live.

==Notes==
Upon accepting '''The Memory Remains''' & [[Aegis of the Redeemer]],
:{{Text|Say|Arator|The Vanguard has rushed out full of conviction. and its soldiers return here to the infirmary.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|We need to get out there and help those still on the battlefield.}}

Upon collecting 2 of the Fallen Vanguard's Mementos,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|May the Light bless the fallen and safeguard the living as we hold back this evil from our world.}}

Upon collecting 4 of the Fallen Vanguard's Mementos,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|All these poor souls were peeled off from their units. We should stay together.}}

Upon collecting 6 of the Fallen Vanguard's Mementos,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|If I've learned anything from this place, it's that the Devouring Host is eager to prey upon our convictions.}}

After collecting 8, turn in both quests to Arator.
