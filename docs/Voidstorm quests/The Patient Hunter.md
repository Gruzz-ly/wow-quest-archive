*[[Vanguard Medic|Second Clue]] discovered
*[[Bloody Trail (Voidstorm)|Third Clue]] discovered

==Description==
These void beasts are elusive, able to open temporary void portals that they can use to move short distances instantaneously. 

They may be beneath [[Turalyon]]'s notice, but they're having devastating effects on the vanguard's morale. 

Between the two of us I'm confident we can outmaneuver them.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Voidbreaker's Soles]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Striders]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Waders]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Sabatons]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*3,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh thank the light! I thought I'd be food for sure!

Can you free me from this thing?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Stay alert, <Name>. These creatures can come from anywhere.}}

Head into the first Dead Vanguard and examine him
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|This was one of the soldiers from the Vanguard. They must've been dragged from their cot, then feasted upon here in the gorge.}}

Head to the [[Vanguard Medic]] and wipe the [[Feasting Karion]] and then examine the body.
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|This body is half-eaten, torn apart by those scavengers.}}

Head to the Bloody Trail and examine it.
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|This blood is fresh... wait, <Name>. Do you hear that?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|A survivor! We're not too late!}}

Head to where the sound is from, and it came from a human named [[Nadia Brighton]] who is held in the [[Voidstalker Patriarch]]'s mouth. The beast leaps into the portal carrying her.
:{{Text|Say|Nadia Brighton|Oh no. Not another portal!}}

Take out the two Voidstalkers.
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Quickly, <Name>! I'll hold the rift open for you, and you can jump through and rescue her.}}

Head into the rift to find Nadia Brighton.
:{{Text|Say|Nadia Brighton|Hello? Is anyone there? I need help!}}
