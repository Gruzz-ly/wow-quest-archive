==Objectives==
Find Lothraxion at the overlook to [[Nexus Point Mid'ar]].

==Description==
I refuse to let another naaru fall to darkness.

Before our departure, the scouts reported they had found a Nexus Point connected to this forge. If the Void's forces possess a naaru, it might be where they're keeping it.

I will prepare the manacells as we conduct the search. Come.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|5|85}}
*3,575 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A naaru, imprisoned. The Light shall give these monsters no mercy.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Keep your distance from the naaru, [[Decimus|voidspawn]]. You are unworthy to bask in its radiance!}}
:''Lothraxion takes off flying.''
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|If you're going to degrade me, Lothraxion, you could at least put some effort into it.}}
:''[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]], [[Alleria Windrunner]], & Decimus starts departing.''

Follow the party into Nexus-Point Mid'ar who are seeing [[Nexus-King Salhadaar]] tormenting [[T'era]] from the high ground,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|There! Imprisoned within that shield!}}

Arator has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|A naaru, taken captive by Xal'atath's forces... We have to do something, <name>.}}

Upon completion,
:{{Text|Emote|Decimus subtly beckons at you with the crook of their finger.}}
