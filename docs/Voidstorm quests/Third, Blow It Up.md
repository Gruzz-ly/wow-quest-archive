==Objectives==
Place 5 Overcharged Manacells at Nexus Point Mid'ar.
*Place [[Overcharged Manacell]] (5)

==Description==
The manacells have been prepared. Set them near the pylon and its supporting machinery. When it's done, I will command [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] to ignite them from afar.

But we cannot proceed until the naaru has been brought to safety. Go now and I will make certain of their freedom.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*14,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is taking too long! Every wasted moment brings us closer to ruin!

==Notes==
Upon accepting '''Third, Blow It Up''' from Lothraxion, [[Just In Case...]] from [[Decimus]], & [[Agents of Darkness]] from Alleria Windrunner,
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]], keep an eye on your mother and her smug hound. I don't want it out of the Light's presence.}}
:''Decimus & Arator starts departing.''
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Direct your zeal at our foes, Lothraxion. And remember that I'm not one of them.}}
:''Alleria departs and not long after, Lothraxion flies off.''

Jump off the ledge into the Nexus-Point.
:{{Text|Say|[[Xal'atath]]|It seems you have visitors, [[Nexus-King Salhadaar|Salhadaar]]. Remember what we discussed.}}
:{{Text|Yell|Nexus-King Salhadaar|They will not stop me! Not this time! Shadowguard, slay them!}}

Head to the pylon and plant 5 Overcharged Manacells

Upon plating the first Overcharged Manacell,
:{{Text|Say|[[Xal'atath]]|A pity Alleria has to die. [[L'ura|Her dark naaru]] would make a far more effective weapon than this one.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Xal'atath]]|If only your Shadowguard had captured it before she claimed its power all those years ago.}}

Upon placing the last Overcharged Manacell,
:{{Text|Say|[[Xal'atath]]|Your foes work quickly, Salhadaar. You had best redouble your efforts to turn the naaru before it's too late. Again.}}
:{{Text|Yell|Nexus-King Salhadaar|Enough of your veiled threats, Xal'atath! You will have your naaru and I will have what I am owed!}}

Head to the ethereal installation and meet up with the party
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|This is taking too long. Stand aside, I'll smash the damned thing.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|No, Lothraxion! <name>, we need your eyes.}}

Upon completion,
:{{Text|Whisper|[[T'era]]|Dusk... Beckons...}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|We need that shield down, now!}}
