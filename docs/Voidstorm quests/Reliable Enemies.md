==Objectives==
Interrogate Decimus.
*Interrogate [[Decimus]]
*Meet up at the overlook above the [[Ethereum Refinery]].
*Talk to Decimus

==Description==
The ren'dorei scouts report a familiar enemy upon this world. [[Ethereal]]s. Wretched scavengers and bandits that plague every corner of the [[Great Dark Beyond]]. The [[Shadowguard]] are the worst of them. We'll handle them.

This... thing we've taken prisoner must know what they're doing here, and much else. Press the Void's secrets from it. See that it is convinced to share what it knows, or I will employ my own methods.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|5|85}}
*3,520 [[XP]]

==Completion==
If Xal'atath was mortal, then she is all the more monstrous for all that she has done. For becoming what she is now.

Our long battle comes to an end on this world. I swear it.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|You will tell us how to break the storm, voidspawn.}}

Speak with Decimus (His gossip is the same as previous but with two options for this quest)
{{Dialogue|{{Gossip|quest=|<Apply force.>}}

{{Gossip|quest=|I don't have time for this. Tell us what you know.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|My. Let's have it, then.}}

Upon giving Decimus a ton of Damage,
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Oh. Now that is something.}}

Upon reaching 20% health,
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Ow. Ha. Hahaha.}}

Upon being depleted to 5%
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Mercy won't get you far out here. But I'lו consider it offered in good faith.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|On the fringes of this world, you will find Nexus-Points. They keep the storm churning.}}
:''Lothraxion walks away.''
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Then we will destroy them. And the ethereals will provide our ordnance.}}
:''[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] and [[Alleria Windrunner]] follows suit.''
:{{Text|Emote|A smile grows across Decimus's face.}}
:''Decimus follows the party.''

Follow the party into the Ethereum Refinery.
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Ah, the ethereals. It was not so long ago that [[Xal'atath]] brought them into the fold.}}

Lothraxion has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|The Army of the Light has made short work of the Shadowguard before. This will be no different.}}

So too does Arator:
{{Dialogue|All my life I was told stories of my mother and father. It shouldered me with lofty expectations.

Seeing my mother in action, making use of what I've learned... For all the danger of this place, it feels good to be with her.}}

Speak with Decimus
{{Dialogue|Xal'atath. Temptation made manifest. Even her foes yield to her whispers.

Care to hear how?

{{Gossip|Play Movie=|How did Xal'atath take control of the ethereals?}}
}}
A [[Midnight in-game cinematics|2.5D cutscene]] "Xal'atath recruits [[Nexus-King Salhadaar|Salhadaar]]" starts and after it's finished.
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Xal'atath... was once mortal?}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|That's what she told Salhadaar. Perhaps it was even the truth.}}
