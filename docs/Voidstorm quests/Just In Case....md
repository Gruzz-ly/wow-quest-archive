==Objectives==
Collect 8 Fragmented Keystones from Devouring Host soldiers at Nexus Point Mid'ar.
*[[Fragmented Keystone]] (8) (Optional)
*[[Master's Override|Combine Fragments]]

==Description==
Perhaps [[Lothraxion]] will be able to bring that shield down on his own. Or perhaps he is a pompous blowhard.

The [[Devouring Host]] offers its trusted soldiers fragments of a relic that can override any ethereal device, including that shield. You'll need to carve quite a swath through their forces to recover enough shards.

But what do I know? I am merely unworthy voidspawn.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*14,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A mortal, receptive to outside ideas. Truly exemplary. No need to thank me.

Though, perhaps you'd want to free me of this bondage? I'm feeling a bit chafed by the Light about now.

No? Oh well.

==Notes==
Upon accepting [[Third, Blow It Up]] from Lothraxion, '''Just In Case...''' from Decimus, & [[Agents of Darkness]] from [[Alleria Windrunner]],
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]], keep an eye on your mother and her smug hound. I don't want it out of the Light's presence.}}
:''Decimus & Arator starts departing.''
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Direct your zeal at our foes, Lothraxion. And remember that I'm not one of them.}}
:''Alleria departs and not long after, Lothraxion flies off.''

Jump off the ledge into the Nexus-Point.
:{{Text|Say|[[Xal'atath]]|It seems you have visitors, [[Nexus-King Salhadaar|Salhadaar]]. Remember what we discussed.}}
:{{Text|Yell|Nexus-King Salhadaar|They will not stop me! Not this time! Shadowguard, slay them!}}

Slay the [[Assimilated Netherdrifter]]s, [[Entropy Orbiter]]s, [[Collapsing Voidcaller]]s, [[Stasis Channeler]]s, [[Lightbreaker (mob)|Lightbreaker]]s, & [[Assimilated Ultradon]]s and loot the Fragmented Keystones from them and then combine the fragments into the Master's Override.

Head to the ethereal installation and meet up with the party
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|This is taking too long. Stand aside, I'll smash the damned thing.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|No, Lothraxion! <name>, we need your eyes.}}

Upon completion,
:{{Text|Whisper|[[T'era]]|Dusk... Beckons...}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|We need that shield down, now!}}
