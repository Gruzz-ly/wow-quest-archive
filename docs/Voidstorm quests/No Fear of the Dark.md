==Objectives==
Help Magister Umbric apply the anchor spell and open a portal to Voidstorm.
*[[Shadow Focus (Silvermoon City)|Shadow Foci]] connected (3)
*Stay a while and listen to [[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]] (Optional)
*Portal entered

==Description==
Against all odds, we made it.

I can open a way into the storm, but it will be a tenuous connection. We can only get a small team through the portal.

We have no idea what awaits us on the other side. We must be prepared.

I can use the [[Cynosure of Twilight|Cynosure]] to bind us to [[Magisters' Terrace]]. If we need a quick escape, I can bring us back there.

Come, help me calibrate this spell.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|11|70}}
*6,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
;Every single race
This... this power! I have never felt the Void like this.

All-consuming.

;{{Race|VoidElf}}
This... this power! I have never felt the Void like this.

It is all-consuming. Like when we were overwhelmed in [[Telogrus Rift|Telogrus]]...

But you overcame it. We can all overcome it. We are ren'dorei.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Here <name>, help me align the spell. It will anchor us back to Magisters' Terrace in case of disaster.}}

Pick one of the Shadow Foci.
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|High Commander [[Lothraxion]] has warred on countless far realms, so I have asked him to lead this mission.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|And young [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] has more than proven his worth. Together, I hope their Light will balance you within the shadow.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|You ren'dorei may be our greatest weapon against the Void. I swear to protect you all.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|The Light is our greatest weapon against the Void. Remember that, or succumb to corruption.}}

Start pulling the first Shadow Focus to the second and connect the second to the third.
:''Magister Umbric opens up a portal''
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|The portal is open. Gather your courage... only darkness awaits us on the other side.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|The fate of Silvermoon, of all Azeroth, may rest on the outcome of this mission. Anu belore dela'na.}}

Lor'themar Theron has a {{Gossip|<Stay awhile and Listen.>}} option.
:''[[Grand Magister Rommath]] steps in.''
:{{Text|Say|Grand Magister Rommath|How DARE you step into Magisters' Terrace, Umbric! You nearly destroyed us all, just like I knew you would!}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|I have confidence in the strength of myself and my allies. Something you noticeably lack, Rommath.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grand Magister Rommath|Confidence? Arrogance! The same arrogance that transformed those poor souls who follow you into void monstrosities!}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|We are not monsters. We are in control. We are ren'dorei.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|Enough. It was a risk to let them near the Sunwell, yes. But we will not win this war without taking risks. The ren'dorei have not wavered yet.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grand Magister Rommath|Yet. We shall see if this "mission" succeeds.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grand Magister Rommath|You've always been reckless, Umbric. You leave calamity and ruin in your wake.}}
:{{Text|Say|Grand Magister Rommath|At least try to make it back alive.}}

Go into the Void Portal and you arrived at the [[Ingress]] and Umbric, [[Riftwalker Sideras]], [[Lady Darkglen]], [[Riftblade Maella]], [[Riftwalker Hieron]], [[Riftblade Astre]], [[Voidlight Everdawn]], Arator & Lothraxion also came here.
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|So much--so much Void!}}

If you're a Void Elf, use the ability: Overcome.
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Resist it, <name>! You control the Shadow, it does not control you!}}

;The following for all the races
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Eyes forward!}}
:{{Text|Say|Voidlight Everdawn|This-- this power! It's like nothing I've ever-- Ha! Ahahaha!!}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Control yourselves!}}

Lothraxion has a new gossip:
{{dialogue|I have seen hundreds, no, thousands, of worlds across the [[Great Dark Beyond]].

We fought the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. These were worlds plunged into war and darkness.

And yet, still, none were like this. This foul taste in the mouth, this chill.

There is something ever darker here. [[Xal'atath]].}}
