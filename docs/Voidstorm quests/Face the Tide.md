==Objectives==
Disrupt Obscurion Citadel forces.
*[[Void-Tainted Flesh]] destroyed (4)
*Void Gate sealed (4)
*[[Abducted Offworlder|Captives]] freed (6)

==Description==
I expected an army, but this is chaos. Beasts pouring from the Void, gorging themselves, taking captives for sport.

Our mission is to claim the Mantle, but we can't ignore this. Sooner or later, these forces will be loosed against [[Silvermoon City|Silvermoon]]. Any blows we strike now will save lives down there, <name>.

Starve their forces, stem the flow of beasts from the Void, and free every captive they've abducted.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*14,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This is what [[Alleria Windrunner|my mother]] has battled on her own for all these years? I won't let her shoulder that burden alone any more.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both [[The Harvest (quest)]] from [[Decimus]] and '''Face the Tide''' from Arator,
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Break her toys and fight to the top of the food chain. Dear little Torentia will take it as a challenge.}}
:''[[Alleria Windrunner]], Arator, & Decimus departs.''

Across the citadel, free the 6 Abducted offworlders, break the 4 Void-Tainted Flesh & the 4 void gates.

Meet up with Arator & Alleria Windrunner
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Some of these captives aren't from Azeroth. How many worlds have suffered the Void's violence?}}

Arator has a gossip,
{{Dialogue|This place is a crime beyond words.

{{Gossip|<Inquire about the captives.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|Was it foolish to hope that only our world would be subject to the Void's hunger?

Look around us. [[Paladin]]s from the [[Sunwell]], defenders of [[Silvermoon]], but there are others too. Offworlders whose garb I do not recognize.

How do we defeat an enemy as hungry and indiscriminate as the Void?

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
