==Objectives==
Collect 8 Abductor's Marks from the voidwalkers of Masters' Perch.
*[[Abductor's Mark]] (8)

==Description==
;Non-draenei
Go home. How? 

<She offers a dramatic flourish with her fingertips, producing some arcane sparks. Then, she makes an X with her index fingers.> 

Of me? No. Of they. 

<Tul'amar gestures to a group of voidwalkers up ahead. She then draws her thumb across her neck.> 

Kill. And. 

<She reaches into a pouch on her hip and retrieves a cracked stone of domanaar make. It looks like a spell reagent of some kind.> 

As this. Need.

;{{Race|Draenei}}/{{Race|Lightforged}}
<Tul'amar reaches into a pouch on her hip and retrieves a cracked stone of domanaar make.>

The voidwalkers carry these. I've been able to use them as spell reagents, and they were helpful for my initial construction of the portal nexus. I presume that they'll help me attune it to our homeworld.

Besides that, they deserve death at your hands. Our suffering is their delight. Repay them the favor.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
;Non-draenei
<She counts out the portal runes in your possession and nods in approval.>

Yes. Good.

;{{Race|Draenei}}/{{Race|Lightforged}}
They want violence? You give them violence. I savored the sight of it.

Those runes look potent. That many should be enough.

==Notes==
Make sure you accept both [[These Violent Delights]] & '''Their Violent Ends'''.

Obtain Abductor's Mark from the [[Dark Abductor]]s, [[Despair Watcher]]s, [[Despair Ender]]s, & [[Eruundi]].

Return to Tul'amar who is now with the [[Freed Prospect]]s and turn in both quests.
