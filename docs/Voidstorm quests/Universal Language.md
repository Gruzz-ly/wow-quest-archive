==Objectives==
Collect blood from the beasts north of the Night Trench.
*[[Predator Blood]] (16)

==Description==
;Non-draenei
To go home, water of life. Need.

<Tul'amar attempts to discern if you understand what she's talking about with a look. After a pause, she opts to stab her own fingertip with the end of her staff and then displays a bead of her blood to you.>

This. Of here. Is of fight. Of fight is Void. Void is power. With power, go home.

<She shows her fangs with an exaggerated snarl before pantomiming a claw swipe.>

Water of life. Of beast. Much. Yes?

;{{Race|Draenei}}/{{Race|Lightforged}}
I must return my people to our world. To safety. Below, we've cobbled together a portal nexus with what we've scavenged from the [[domanaar]]. But we have not been able to get it to work.

However, I witnessed a magical reaction when an argument between two [[Broken|krokul]] came to blows. It flickered to life, briefly. Like everything else of the Void. I believe domanaar magic resonates with violence.

Bring me blood from the beasts of the trench to the north. I have an idea.

<She shows her fangs in a playful snarl before pantomiming a claw swipe.>

Beasts. You remember those from [[Argus]]. don't you? Or are you too young?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You. Not die? Good.

==Completion==
;Non-draenei
Blood! Is blood. Yes?

<She looks to one of her kin, who assures her that she's got the right word this time.>

Good. Now see.

;{{Race|Draenei}}/{{Race|Lightforged}}
I'd have put our people to the task, had the fighting pits not broken so many in body and spirit.

Let us see if my theory is correct.

==Notes==
Head to the [[Night Trench]] and slay the [[Shredclaw Packhunter]]s, [[Hunting Netherwasp]]s, [[Ultradon Tyrant]]s, [[Netherflit]]s, & [[Nightbrood]]s and collect their Predator Blood.
