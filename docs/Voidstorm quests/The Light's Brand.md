==Description==
No! <name>, we have to stop them! Lothraxion's boiling temper risks everything! That he chooses now of all times, when my mother is out of commission...

There's no time. We have to go!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*17,875 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I should have realized earlier... Join me. <name>, Let us reveal the truth.

==Completion==
Decimus is a far more capable domanaar than they've been letting on.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Arator! Stop them!}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|We have to move!}}
:''The duo starts running to find Lothraxion.''

Follow the duo to the outskirts
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|You are a paladin, Arator! You must see this Decimus for the monster it is!}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|<name>, empower me with the Light and I'll try to restrain them!}}

Collect the burning light bring them to the circle.
:{{Text|Yellow|Lothraxion's wrathful Light sears your flesh! Infuse Arator with its power!}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Jumping at shadows, in fear of deceit? Quite a unique variety of nathrezim you are, Lothraxion.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|I was reforged in the Light! You are blind to the truth!}}

Upon having too much light,
:{{Text|Yellow|Too much wrathful Light sears your flesh! Infuse Arator with its power!}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|The Light... it burns with Lothraxion's wrath... just like my [[Turalyon|father]]'s...}}

Speak with Arator,
{{Dialogue|We have to stop them! Bring me the holy energy scattered around the battlefield, and I think I can use it to break them up! Hurry!

{{Gossip|<Ask Arator for healing.>}}
}}

Upon delivering 15,
:{{Text|Yell|Arator|Cease!}}
:''Arator stops Decimus as Alleria Windrunner comes in.''
:{{Text|Say|Arator|By the Light's mercy, I command you both to yield! We have no shortage of enemies!}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|And we need not create them where we might find allies. Decimus is more than they seem.}}

Lothraxion has a new gossip:
{{Dialogue|Senseless void elf! Have you lost your mind?! That thing is a monster! And you helped it evade the Light's justice!

You and I will have words when this mission is at its end.}}

So too does Arator,
{{Dialogue|<Arator gulps down air with ragged breaths. His face is drenched with sweat.>

I wasn't sure that was going to work... Thank you, <name>.}}

Interact and reveal Decimus,
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|... Gave myself away, did I?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|You seek power, Decimus. Xal'atath will not give you what you want, but her defeat might. Join us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Truly fascinating. You continue to defy expectations.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|This beast is off its leash!}}
:''Decimus summons his staff.''
