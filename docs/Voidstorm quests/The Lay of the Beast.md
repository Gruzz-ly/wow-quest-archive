==Objectives==
Use Decimus' pet to scout the Voidspire.
*Scout the Devouring Citadel (3)
*Stay a while and listen to [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]

==Description==
Your friend's scheme to blow up the nexus-point was adorable. You all looked so determined, I didn't have the heart to tell you how simple the solution really is.

The Mantle of Predation will allow you to enter the nexus-points and weaken the storm. Alas, it's claiming the Mantle that will truly test you.

Borrow my pet, see through his eyes. I'll show you who you'll steal the Mantle from.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*14,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There you have it, simply steal the Mantle from Terminas. I'd recommend acting quickly. Who knows when Terminas will return to the Obscurion Citadel.

A shame about Ciphus. I was planning to devour him myself once I'd fattened him up.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Borrow my pet's sight. I'll tell you how to weaken the storm.}}

Arator has a {{Gossip|quest=|<Stay Awhile and Listen.>}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|Why are you so eager to help us?}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|I'm a creature of passion.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Lothraxion]]|A creature without purpose. Like every fiend from the Void.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Watching your struggles blazing bright against an uncaring cosmos--it's delicious.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Xal'atath would devour your world. All worlds. Even the stars.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|She would leave nothing but an empty abyss. Can you imagine anything more dull?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Loyalty is so contrary to the Void that you'd betray your master out of boredom?}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|I need no master. We should all obey our own appetites.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Some of us serve greater purposes than hunger, beast.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|The cosmos is a feast, lightling. Why not enjoy it?}}

Hop onto [[Ciphus]] you head into the [[Approach]]

You have these abilites:

Upon scouting the first area,
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|The key to weakening the storm is an artifact known as the Mantle of Predation.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|With it, you may enter a nexus-point and simply shut it down. Doing so will nullify the others in a cascade.}}

Upon scouting the second area,
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Why merely shut down the nexus-points? We should raze them from within.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|And cause an energy surge that would obliterate precious Silvermoon? Shut them down safely, spare your poor city.}}

Upon scouting the third area near [[Terminas]],
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Ah. "Lord" Terminas. He keeps the Mantle at the Obscurion Citadel.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|How fortunate that he's busy here, leaving his vault unguarded.}}
:{{Text|Say|Terminas|Hello little morsel. How did you drift so close?}}

Terminas has caught you and you're back with the party.

Upon completion.
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Steal the Mantle of Predation, enter a nexus-point, and weaken the storm. Terminas will be humiliated.}}
