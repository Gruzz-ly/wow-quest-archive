<The man calls out to you in your native tongue. His accent is unfamiliar to you.>

A sister of [[Argus]]! Kin of mine! Lost to us for ages, surely you hail from the... No, my questions can wait. There are more pressing matters.

These [[domanaar]] kidnapped us from our world. Portals opened, and they poured forth from the sky. They force us to fight and die in their arenas for their amusement! I escaped, only to be captured again trying to help my people.

My elder sister, Tul'amar, has a plan to get us home. Set me free, and I'll take you to her.

Friend? Hope of us.

;{{Race|Draenei}}/{{Race|Lightforged}}
I am filled with cautious hope to see kin of ours in this hellish place. And I owe you for rescuing my younger brother.

But I have more to ask of you.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Emote|Juras bows gratefully and then points to the northwestern horizon.}}
:{{Text|Say|Juras the Nethersent|[Draenei] Thorje te.}} / {{RaceIcon|Draenei|Male}}{{RaceIcon|Draenei|Female}}{{RaceIcon|Lightforged|Male}}{{RaceIcon|Lightforged|Female}} {{Text|Say|Juras the Nethersent|Follow me.}}

Head to the [[Exile's Hovel]] and meet up with Juras the Nethersent.
:{{Text|Say|Juras the Nethersent|[Draenei] Kiel veni Alar toralar ul. Y Rakkan melar! Za gular te.}} / {{RaceIcon|Draenei|Male}}{{RaceIcon|Draenei|Female}}{{RaceIcon|Lightforged|Male}}{{RaceIcon|Lightforged|Female}} {{Text|Say|Juras the Nethersent|Look at what I've brought us. Long lost kin of ours! <He/She> saved me.}}
:{{Text|Emote|Juras gestures towards you. Tul'amar eyes you carefully as the other refugees murmur in awe.}}

Juras has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|<Juras gives you a big smile and a thumbs up.>

Thank you, thank you!}}

Juras also  has a different gossip for the {{Race|Draenei}} & the {{Race|Lightforged Draenei}},
{{Dialogue|Thank you for rescuing me, <brother/sister>. I owe you my life, or at least a hug. hah.

Tul'amar has been working on a method of getting us home. Forgive her for being cautious of you. She bears a certain... bitterness towards the Light and those who still bear its gift. Unlike her, I hold onto my faith.

<Juras clutches his naaru pendant and exhales.>

But I won't deny feeling forgotten either.}}

So too does Tul'amar for the non-Draenei races,
{{Dialogue|Tul'amar.

<She points to herself.>

Work of mine, brothers and sisters safe. Go home.

{{Gossip|<Ask how she knows your language.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|Much time from now. Ethereals. Bad. Not here. Far place.

But, that place, one like you. See in... man'trath-- eh...

<Tul'amar pantomimes a spherical shape and then makes a few arcane sparks with her fingers.>

One like you, good to us. Help. Then bye.

Yes?

{{Gossip|Close enough.}}
}}
}}

Tul'amar has a gossip for the {{Race|Draenei}} and {{Race|Lightforged Draenei}},
{{Dialogue|It is a miracle to see you in such a place. <brother/sister>.

I am Tul'amar. It is my duty to guard my people, the Nethersent, and see them. home.

{{Gossip|{{text|rare|(Draenei)}}: I don't recognize your accent, sister.}}
{{Dialogue-child|Thousands of years separated from our kin on the [[Genedar]] has a way of carving rifts between us. I should explain.

Many of us followed our [[Prophet Velen]] in his great flight away from [[Sargeras]]'s [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. Perhaps you know the many worlds we sought refuge upon. Perhaps you stepped foot upon some of them yourself, as we did. Worlds of snow and ice, of mist and bush, of endless oceans. No world we could settle for long.

The Legion came, as always, and I and others who could not promptly return to our dimensional ship were left behind. We watched the Genedar drift into the sky until it was nothing more than a glimmering dot. And then, gone.

Since then, we have survived in the [[Great Dark Beyond]]. Alone.

{{Gossip|<Tell her about Draenor, Azeroth, and Sargeras's defeat.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|<Tul'amar listens carefully as you explain the history of the draenei since she had been separated.>

I had heard news of our victory on Argus. We have stumbled upon fel-scarred kin seeking redemption in greater number than ever before as of late. I regret that we were not there to join you.

There is so much more for us to discuss. sister. I hope there will be time to. But dan we are in danger here. My people need to go home.

{{Gossip|Return to Azeroth with us. Be with your people.}}
{{Dialogue-child|I... I will consider it. But you must understand, these people--my people--we already have a home. They have families, loved ones who were stolen away from them.

Imagine doing the same. Leaving everything behind to join with us. To hope that a new world is safer than the one you already know and love.

We can discuss this more, later. But we're in danger as we stand here and speak.

{{Gossip|Very well.}}
