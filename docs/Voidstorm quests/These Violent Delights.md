==Objectives==
Use the Relic of Liberation to free 10 Master's Prospects and 3 Unwilling Summons.
*[[Master's Prospect]] Freed  (10)
*[[Unwilling Summon]] Sent Home (3)
*[[Relic of Liberation]] (Provided)

==Description==
;Non-draenei
Brothers and sisters. Here. Help.

<Tul'amar connects her thumb and index finger on both hands to make a chain. Then, she breaks the link with a sharp gesture.>

How? Show.

<She then produces a glimmering arcane relic and holds it over her gauntlet. She spends a portion of her arcane energy Into it. Its newly activated magic forces the straps holding her glove in place loose.>

Use.

;{{Race|Draenei}}/{{Race|Lightforged}}
The domanaar capture us and others across worlds and force us to fight for their amusement. Their fascination with mortals is equal only to their sadism.

I was able to improvise a device from a combination of my magic and the pure chaos of this world and used it to escape. It breaks shackles, both those literal and metaphysical. Using it just once takes a lot out of me.

<Tul'amar produces the arcane relic and then spends as much of her arcane energy into the device as she can to charge it. She gulps for air with ragged breaths from the effort.>

Free our kin and disrupt the gates they used to steal us to this world.

I won't let anyone else be left behind.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 13,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
;Non-draenei
<Tul'amar tilts her head at the freed draenei hiding behind her.>

I see. Good. You good.

;{{Race|Draenei}}/{{Race|Lightforged}}
<Tul'amar nods to the freed draenei hiding behind her.>

When we fight, it's on our terms.

==Notes==
Make sure you accept both '''These Violent Delights''' & [[Their Violent Ends]].

Use the Relic of Liberation to free the [[Master's Prospect]] from the [[Disgraced Contender]]s & the [[Despair Watcher]]s.

Slay the [[Dark Abductor]]s & Despair Watchers to free the Unwilling Summons.

Return to Tul'amar who is now with the [[Freed Prospect]]s and turn in both quests.
