==Objectives==
Slay foes to attract Torentia's attention.
*Attract Torentia's attention

==Description==
Two sigils, you'll need both to open [[Terminas]]' vault and claim the mantle.

The first belongs to [[Torentia]], petty ruler of this sad trench. Too ambitious for Terminas to bring her into his inner circle, too cowardly to strike out on her own. So here she cowers behind an unbreakable shield of void.

She's terrified of losing her already meager holdings. What a pity. Slaughter your way through the trench, the potential emergence of a new apex predator is something she won't ignore.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*14,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Do you sense it? Every beast here either fears you or wants to kill you. Even their mistress cannot ignore you now.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both '''The Harvest''' from Decimus and [[Face the Tide]] from [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]],
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Break her toys and fight to the top of the food chain. Dear little Torentia will take it as a challenge.}}
:''[[Alleria Windrunner]], Arator, & Decimus departs.''

Fill the bar by slaying the [[Ravenous Voidwalker]]s (5%), [[Scrabbling Voidspawn]]s (5%), [[Hungering Voidwraith]]s (5%), [[Marrowmouth Consumptor]]s (5%), & [[Trench Shredclaw]]s.

Upon reaching 100%,
:{{Text|Yell|Torentia|Filthy upstart! You'll bleed out like the rest.}}

Meet up with Arator & Alleria Windrunner
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Some of these captives aren't from Azeroth. How many worlds have suffered the Void's violence?}}

Arator has a gossip,
{{Dialogue|This place is a crime beyond words.

{{Gossip|<Inquire about the captives.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|Was it foolish to hope that only our world would be subject to the Void's hunger?

Look around us. [[Paladin]]s from the [[Sunwell]], defenders of [[Silvermoon]], but there are others too. Offworlders whose garb I do not recognize.

How do we defeat an enemy as hungry and indiscriminate as the Void?

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
