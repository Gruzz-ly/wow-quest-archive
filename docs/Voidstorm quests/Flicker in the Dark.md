:''Lothraxion, Alleria Windrunner, [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]], & [[Decimus]] departs from the ethereal installation.''
:{{Text|Say|[[Xal'atath]]|Complete your task and return to the [[Voidspire]], [[Nexus-King Salhadaar|Salhadaar]]. You shall have the power you were promised.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Xal'atath]]|So long as you remain gracious in accepting it, of course.}}

Head outside the ethereal installation until Salhadaar stops you.
:{{Text|Yell|Nexus-King Salhadaar|The naaru has fallen! All this power... pledged to Xal'atath... while I have nothing in return!}}
:{{Text|Yell|Nexus-King Salhadaar|Even now, in my moment of victory, I must bow and scrape before her!}}
:{{Text|Yell|Nexus-King Salhadaar|How I wish I could watch you all die! T'era, destroy them!}}
:''Salhadaar teleports off.''
:{{Text|Say|T'era|The brightest Light casts the longest shadow.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|I will not allow this!}}

Lothraxion is trying to subdue T'era from turning into a void naaru while Arator uses his light shield defending the party whilst Alleria Windrunner & Decimus are slaying the monsters.

Slay the Dark Splinters and then,
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|No! You... must...!}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|It's her or us! We have to fight!}}
:{{Text|Say|T'era|Be unmade.}}

Upon depleting T'era's health to 50%,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|The Void! It's too much!}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Arator! No!}}

Upon subduing, a [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Alleria Shoots The Pylon" starts playing:
:{{Text|Bossemote|T'era taunts Alleria, saying she will drag Arator into darkness.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria doesn't want Arator to see her dark side, but T'era gives her no choice.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator watches in horror, Decimus in glee, as Alleria uses her dark naaru to destroy T'era.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|The Nexus Point is still standing and we slink off.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, the party is currently recovering from the attack.
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|A naaru, lost to us!}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Mother, the toll you've taken... We should fall back and recover.}}

Alleria has a gossip after completion,
{{Dialogue|That was... everything... I had...}}
