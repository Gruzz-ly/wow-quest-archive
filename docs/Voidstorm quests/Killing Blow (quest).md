==Objectives==
Escort Nadia safely from the cave.
*Nadia Freed from Void Prison
*Nadia Escorted Safely
*[[Stalker Patriarch]] Defeated

==Description==
I heard about these beasts but I thought it was a rumor. Void creatures appearing out of void portals, kidnapping and eating our officers... sounds like a load of bunk. I never thought it'd happen to me.

There was a big one that got me, but he ran off. Please, let's get out of here before it comes back!

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Voidbreaker's Glovettes]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Grasps]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Gauntlets]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Handguards]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*3,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Don't worry about this one. I'll make sure she makes it back safely.

==Notes==
Release Nadia Brighton from the prison.
:{{Text|Say|Nadia Brighton|You're not with the Vanguard. Not that I mind the rescue. Who was that woman you were with?}}
:{{Text|Say|Nadia Brighton|Was that the [[Turalyon|High Exarch]]'s wife? I mean girlfriend. I thought she'd be taller. Is it true she has a [[L'ura|dark naaru]] for a heart?}}

Upon facing the Voidstalkers that caught you,
:{{Text|Say|Nadia Brighton|I will wreathe you in holy fire!}}
:{{Text|Say|Nadia Brighton|I've got you, <Name>!}}
:{{Text|Say|Nadia Brighton|The light take you, beast!}}
:{{Text|Say|Nadia Brighton|Are you hungry? Well, too bad!}}

Upon reaching the exit, meet with the [[Voidstalker Patriarch]],
:{{Text|Say|Nadia Brighton|That's the big bastard that brought me here.}}
:{{Text|Say|Nadia Brighton|Take that! And a little bit of this!}}
:{{Text|Say|Nadia Brighton|Time to light'im up!}}

Upon slaying the Voidstalker Patriarch, Alleria Windrunner appears.
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|<Name>, you made it. And you managed to rescue the officer.}}
:{{Text|Say|Nadia Brighton|Oh my Light, it really IS you! This. Is. Ah-may-zing!}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|And you are?}}
:{{Text|Say|Nadia Brighton|My friends back in [[Stormwind]] are never going to believe this!}}
