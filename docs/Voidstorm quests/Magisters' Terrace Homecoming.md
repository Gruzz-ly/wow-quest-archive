==Objectives==
Meet Magister Umbric on the Isle of Quel'Danas, then complete the Magister's Terrace dungeon.
*Meet Magister Umbric on the [[Isle of Quel'Danas]]
*Talk to Umbric to queue for follower dungeon (Optional)
*Retrieve the [[Cynosure of Twilight]] from [[Magisters' Terrace]]

==Description==
We know there's land inside the [[Voidstorm]], through its massive portal. If we can reach it, we can take the fight to Xal'atath.

I have found the key. It is a relic known as the [[Cynosure of Twilight]]. For ages, it has mystified us by revealing unreachable pathways to infinite unknowns.

My research tells me I can use it to open a path to the storm.

There's just one problem: it's in [[Magister's Terrace]]. And as you know, <name>, we ren'dorei are not exactly... in their good graces, at the moment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|93|60}}
*25,700 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That could have gone better.

Then again, Rommath hasn't killed me, yet. It could have gone worse.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|[[Lor'themar Theron]]|Using a relic of the Void to breach the storm... it sounds risky, Umbric.}}
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|It is a risk, Regent Lord. But it's also the only way to end the siege on Silvermoon.}}
:''Magister Umbric departs.''

Follow Magister Umbric into Magisters' Terrace
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|It's been too long since I've seen these walls.}}

Speak to Umbric
{{dialogue|Magisters' Terrace.

I spent my youth here. Mastered my first spells here. At the Midsummer Ball, I danced with [[Tharofar Goldveil]] and felt...

<Umbric sighs.>

Those days are long gone. This place has changed. I have changed. People like you and I are no longer welcome.

We cannot restore the past. The ren'dorei must make our own traditions, our own families.

Our own futures.

{{Gossip|quest=|(Queue for follower dungeon)

<Tell Umbric you'd like to enter Magisters' Terrace with assistance.>}}

{{Gossip|<Ask Umbric for more information about the Void Elves and Magisters' Terrace.>}}
{{Gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|I understand. The details are fuzzy, even among us ren'dorei.

Many of us, like myself, studied in Magisters' Terrace. [[Grand Magister Rommath|Rommath]] was my mentor.

I felt that we must understand our enemy to defeat it. So, I led a team of researchers to study the Void. We discovered the journals of [[Dar'Khan Drathir|Dar'khan Drathir]], the very elf who betrayed Silvermoon to the [[Lich King]]. His actions had led to the destruction of so much we held dear during the Third War. And his research into the Void helped bring it about.

So you can understand, even with the blood elves' long use of dangerous magic such as fel, why our research was reviled. We refused to stop, so we were exiled.

I do not regret my choices, only the suffering it has brought my people.

{{Gossip|<Ask Umbric for more information about Void Elves and the Sunwell >}}
{{Dialogue-child|Around the time we ren'dorei were exiled, [[Alleria Windrunner]] finally came home to Silvermoon. She had spent countless years fighting demons across the realms and wished to bask in the warmth of the Sunwell.

But in her journeys, she had absorbed the essence of a dark naaru, [[L'ura]]. It transformed her much in the same way the ren'dorei had been transformed. She was a creature of Void.

And Light and Void are inextricably tied to one another.

When she [[Remember the Sunwell|approached]] the Sunwell, its Light clashed violently with her Void. Creatures of darkness surged forth. If our greatest heroes had not been present, the Sunwell could have turned completely to Void.

Hence so many want us forever banished. Hence we must be so, so careful

{{Gossip|{{Race|VoidElf}}<Tell Umbric you understand the feeling.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|Thank you, <name>.

I hope you do not regret the path that led you here with me. If you'll forgive me a moment of sentimentality... I'm very happy you're here.

We've lost many along the way. Those who have succumbed to the Void, those that have lost themselves in the madness...

But you are here. If ever you doubt your strength, your resilience, remember:

You are here. And that is enough.

Thank you.

Speak with Umbric or go into Magister's Terrace to go to the Dungeon.

Complete the dungeon and then go to [[Duskglow Gloriette]]. Umbric along with Lor'themar Theron, [[Riftwalker Sideras]], [[Lady Darkglen]], [[Riftblade Maella]], [[Riftwalker Hieron]], [[Riftblade Astre]], [[Voidlight Everdawn]], [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] & [[Lothraxion]] are present.
:{{Text|Say|[[Lor'themar Theron]]|You did what you had to, Umbric. We must enter the Voidstorm if we are to stop it.}}

Each of the NPCs that are present has something to say
{{Dialogue|title=Lor'themar Theron|Many will question my decision to allow the ren'dorei in Silvermoon, much less so close to the Sunwell. More than anyone, I understand their anger and fear toward anyone would choose to follow in the footsteps of Dar'khan Drathir.

Dar'khan was my friend, once. The pain of his betrayal still lingers within me like a knife.

And yet, many also questioned the ren'dorei's exile in the first place. These elves have families, friends. Not all consider them lost.

Now more than ever, we cannot afford to be divided.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Arator|I was all too happy to answer Lor'themar's call to join this strike mission into Voidstorm, the very nexus of the darkness that plagues the Vanguard of the Light.

We will pierce it and relieve our armies.

And...

<Arator looks away.>

And here has been no word of my mother for so long. Something... something tells me that if I'll find Alleria anywhere, it'll be in there, already taking the fight to [[Xal'atath]].}}
{{Dialogue|title=Lothraxion|The Vanguard of the Light is overburdened. We can barely spare a single soldier.

[[Turalyon]] must stay to continue to lead our forces. Fortunately, I've led more than my fare share of deadly, elite missions.

We will not fail.

{{Gossip|<Briefly ask Lothraxion about himself.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|I am many things, mortal. I am [[nathrezim]], I am [[demon]], I am death. But above all, I am [[Lightforged]].

My kind, the nathrezim, or dreadlords, are well renowned for our shape-shifting, deceit, and... shifting loyalties.

For a time, I fought alongside my kind in the [[Burning Legion]]. I followed the orders of our [[Zovaal|true, deathly master]] and dutifully sent them my reports. We cared for nothing but the Void's destruction, even at the cost of worlds.

But then I met the [[draenei]]. I saw their Light. And I saw that the only way to truly defeat the Void is to embrace its counterpart. To become one with the Light.

The other nathrezim did not understand. So I left them behind. The Light is my only path.

{{Gossip|<Ask Lothraxion why you should trust him if he is nathrezim, so known for deceit.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|<Lothraxion scowls.>

Are all [[orc]]s bloodthirsty berserkers? Are all [[pandaren]] drunken [[monk]]s? Are all elves arrogant snobs?

Our choices make us who we are. Not our births. Why would that be any different for us nathrezim than it is for you mortals?

I have left my past behind me. I refuse to lie, shape-shift, or betray. It is not the way of the Light.

The Light has purged me of old allegiances. I am remade in its radiance as a soldier of the Vanguard of the Light.

{{Dialogue|title=Riftblade Maella|I was a Spellbreaker. Magisters' Terrace was my home.

I researched the Void to help my people, but I never wanted to become one with it. I never wanted to leave my home.

Did Rommath listen? Did the Magisters understand? No.

<Maella scowls.>}}
{{Dialogue|title=Riftwalker Sideras|Last time I saw Silvermoon at war, I was a lieutenant in the Farstriders. I remember standing with my platoon, just like this, shoulder to shoulder on the wall. Word came down the line: [[Sylvanas Windrunner|the ranger-general]] was dead. None of us believed it. Not until the undead burst from the treeline...

<Sideras shakes his head.>

It's the same feeling now. Some things never change, do they, <name>?}}
{{Dialogue|title=Riftblade Astre|It was not so long ago that I thought of this place as home. Great things were expected of me. I was valued, wanted--until my talents made my life different from the one that had been planned for me. Until the moment I told them who I really was.

<Astre turns their gaze skyward, bitter.>

I'm not here to save them. I want them to witness us. To know they were wrong.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Riftwalker Hieron|<Hieron looks up from quietly checking over the equipment of his comrades as you approach.>

Ah, <name>. Our secret weapon. You give me confidence we're not all being sent off to our deaths. A good half of Silvermoon would probably approve of that scheme. The Void is especially out of fashion of late, be it storm or elf.

It is my wish that they'll come around. To us, anyway. Let's give them good reason to.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Voidlight Everdawn|The Void and the Light do not have to always be in opposition to one another. My faith protects my from the evil of the Void.

And it will protect me from what lies beyond the storm. You can count on me.}}
{{Dialogue|title=Lady Darkglen|My [[Blocciniux|voidwalker]] has whispered to me of the Voidstorm. It swirls with madness and violence.

I am eager to test my skills against it.}}
