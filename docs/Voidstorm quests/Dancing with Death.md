==Objectives==
Slay Voidgrasper, Vathan the Rebel, and Scytheryp the Slicer in [[Nexus-Point Antius]].
*[[Voidgrasper]] slain
*[[Vathen the Rebel]] slain
*[[Scytheryp the Slicer]] slain

==Description==
We may be a small strike team, but we are strong. We have you, after all.

There is no need to move with complete stealth. We must cut a path to the domanaar here.

Take down the strongest enemies you can find. We will join you in the fray.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*17,655 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There seems to be creatures here both bestial and magical.

The Void is drawn to violence. I have seen countless worlds drown in it.

Could the savagery of the beasts here have brought the Void in naturally?

==Notes==
Upon accepting both '''Dancing with Death''' from Lothraxion & [[A Strange, Different World]] from [[Alleria Windrunner]],
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|We must be cautious. My attempts to infiltrate this place alone have been thwarted.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|The time for caution has passed. We will reach their leader and rip the information we need from it!}}
:''Lothraxion, Alleria, & [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] took off.''

Upon nearing Scytheryp the Slicer, Lothraxion appears.
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|These vile monsters are no match for us, <name>!}}

Make sure you slay Scytheryp the Slicer.
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Ha! Kill and kill, yet no alarm is raised. They seem used to this chaos.}}

Upon nearing Vathen the Rebel, Alleria Windrunner appears.
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|They will even shackle their own kind? Interesting. Some even seem willing.}}

Make sure you slay Vathen the Rebel.
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|There, base of the tower. That's the one in charge.}}

Upon nearing Voidgrasper, Arator appears.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Right ahead, Ariana! Let's take it down together!}}

Make sure you slay Voidgrasper.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|All the creatures here seem to be immersed in Void, down to the smallest mite. Stay sharp.}}

Regroup with the party
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|You intend to take it prisoner? I would rather incinerate it.}}

==Progression==
