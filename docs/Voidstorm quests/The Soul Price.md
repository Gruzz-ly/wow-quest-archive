==Objectives==
Free spirits and collect their energy in Kil'jaeden's Terrace.
*Spirits released (8)

==Description==
[[Argus]].

Originally the homeworld of the [[Eredar]], now the stronghold for the [[Burning Legion]]. Years ago, [[Illidan]] used a [[:Sargerite Keystone]] to open the way here. And he was met by [[Xe'ra|one]] of the [[naaru]] who delivered a dire message.

To understand the [[Illidari]]'s connection to the Void, you must see what Illidan saw when he arrived. Hostile spirits in the area should provide the necessary power for our needs.

Defeat them to release their essence, and with their sacrifice we will peer into the past.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 3,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Yes, that looks like enough. We're nearly prepared, <name>.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|[[Leona Darkstrider]]|I will join you, <name>.}}
:{{Text|Say|Allari the Souleater|I need you here, Leona. Take this incense and place it at the cardinal points around the platform.}}

Slay the [[Agitated Citizen]]s, [[Forsaken Denizen]]s, [[Restless Novitiate]]s, & [[Unstable Consul]]s.
