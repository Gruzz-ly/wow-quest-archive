==Description==
;Non-draenei
Man of Void. Have key. Need. Key to home.

<Tul'amar gestures down the way to the northwest. She grimaces back at her injured kin.>

Go back, we. Wait. Hope. For you.

;{{Race|Draenei}}/{{Race|Lightforged}}
One more thing before we can return to our refuge. There is a [[domanaar]], whose name is Snaerius. He scrys the vastness of the [[Great Dark Beyond]] in search of more victims, more fighters for these pits.

Kill him and seize the focus he uses to spy on distant realms. It's the last piece of the puzzle.

I wish I could join you in the fight, but I need to get the injured to safety. We will await your return, <brother/sister>.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Exile's Tattered Shawl]]
*[[Nethersent Eredar's Cloak]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 16,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Tul'amar smiles sadly at her people.>

==Completion==
;Non-draenei
Stay. I must. Men of Void, cannot find brothers and sisters. Finish, must. Only I.

You, good. Friend. But. Trust, can't. Trust. only when brothers and sisters safe.

<She then holds her staff forward, offering it to [[Juras the Nethersent|Juras]]. Though he seems reluctant to take it, Tul'amar does not waver.>

;{{Race|Draenei}}/{{Race|Lightforged}}
You made this possible, <name>. We kin. lost and now reunited. But they must return--and I must be the one to ensure it.

I cannot walk through that portal with them. I must destroy it, to ensure that no domanaar can follow them through and darken our skies as before.

You are my kin. But I cannot trust you with this. I can't rest until I know they're safe.

<She then holds her staff forward, offering It to Juras. Though he seems reluctant to take it, Tul'amar does not waver.>

Tul'amar has a gossip after completion,
{{Dialogue|Draenei. Is word. You know? Word is: one of exile.

<Tul'amar exhales and looks away.>

Need alone. Need time.

See you again. Find you. Safe place.}}

Tul'amar has a different gossip for the {{Race|Draenei}} & the {{Race|Lightforged Draenei}}
{{Dialogue|Draenei. Exiled one.

My first exile was the day our great flight began. [[Velen]]'s words roused my heart. All of us who stepped onto the [[Genedar]], exiled from [[Argus]] as one. I prayed I was making the right choice.

The second was the day the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] ambushed our world. I was with Juras. searching below ground for minerals to replace a broken power core. He had begged our mother to leave the ship and come help his big sister. The earth lurched from the steps of fel reavers. By the time we returned to the surface, felfire cannons had forced the Genedar into the sky. They had to leave. They had no choice. I know that.

And now... Again.

I need some time to be alone. But I'll find you out there. Somewhere safe. where we can talk at length.}}
