<Name>, [[Ethereal]]s have been striking out from the Ethereum Overcroft, harassing our vanguard forces where they find them. If you can bring the fight to them, it'll take the pressure off our muster.

*[[Voidbreaker's Greathelm]]

You will also receive:

*3,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you, <Name>. The ethereals' focus will be turned inwards for a time, and to will give us space to move.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both [[Powerless]] & '''Master of Mayhem'''
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|The captured ren'dorei are links in a chain. Break that chain, and our assault can truly begin.}}
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|You're right, Umbric. Freeing your people gives us the opening we need for an assault.}}

Fill up the bar by slaying the [[Overcroft Militant]]s (7%), [[Overcroft Technician]]s, [[Overcroft Inquisitor]]s, [[Overcroft Skypiercer]]s (7%),  [[Overcroft Automaton]]s (12%), [[Overcroft Ascendant]]s (12%) & the scrolls.

Return to Turalyon and Umbric and turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|Well done, <name>! You've struck a decisive blow against the Devouring Host. With Umbric's help.}}

Upon completion, An Assault Warframe arrives.

High Exarch Turalyon has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|The Voidspire is formidable. But anything built, can be torn down.

This will be no different.}}
