==Objectives==
Travel to Argus.
*Illidari Gateway entered

==Description==
Thanks for freeing me from those ethereal cages in the [[Ethereum Overcroft]]. The Void is powerful here in ways we're only beginning to understand, and that danger brings new opportunities.

If you remember, my quest to combine the power of the Void with the strength of the [[Illidari]] has not changed.

Backing [[Adarus]] was a mistake, but a necessary one to progress. And now I've found a willing teacher in Allari. I ask for your help again, <name>. Help me find the strength to protect my people.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 3,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I haven't set foot on Argus in years. A dead world, populated by a broken people and their memories.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Allari the Souleater|Follow me. You must understand why the Illidari sacrifice.}}
:{{Text|Say|Allari the Souleater|To Argus. To see what Illidan has seen.}}
:''Allari opens a gateway.''

Allari has a gossip,
{{Dialogue|Have you been on this planet long, <name>? These apex void predators are perfect for honing my scythe skills.

{{Gossip|I'm curious, Allari. Did the naaru persist in their attempts to sway Illidan to their cause?}}
{{Dialogue-child|They did, quite adamantly in fact. Would you like to see how it turned out?

{{Gossip|Play Movie=|Show me.}} (This shows the Rejection of the Gift from [[The Child of Light and Shadow]].)
}}
}}

Take the Illidari Gateway and it takes you to [[Kil'jaeden's Terrace]]
