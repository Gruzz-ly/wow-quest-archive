==Objectives==
Collect 12 Shadowgraft Fragments in Nexus-Point Antius.
*[[Shadowgraft Fragment]] (12)

==Description==
I don't know the purpose of these towers, only that they are called Nexus-Points and they thrum with Void power. We must get more information.

The domanaar use some kind of Void-infused metal on the beasts here to add them to armies of the Devouring Host.

They call it shadowgrafting.

It empowers them, but also influences their minds.

<Alleria smiles wryly.>

What power doesn't?

I have a plan for it. With you here, I can finally act on it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*17,655 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The metal on these creatures... it seems particularly conductive to magical energies. Interesting.

==Completion==
<Lothraxion scowls.>

Despicable stuff. Alleria has explained her plan to me, but I'm not sure I agree.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both '''Dancing with Death''' from Lothraxion & [[A Strange, Different World]] from [[Alleria Windrunner]],
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|We must be cautious. My attempts to infiltrate this place alone have been thwarted.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|The time for caution has passed. We will reach their leader and rip the information we need from it!}}
:''Lothraxion, Alleria, & [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] took off.''

Slay the [[Clawing Voidwalker]]s, [[Duskcry Voidwalker]]s, [[Hovering Siphoid]]s, [[Lurking Creepling]]s, [[Towering Ultradon]]s, [[Scytheryp the Slicer]], [[Vathen the Rebel]], [[Voidgrasp]], [[Sundereth the Caller]], & the [[Whipwind Shredclaw]]s and loot the Shadowgraft Fragment.

Regroup with the party after collecting 12.
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|You intend to take it prisoner? I would rather incinerate it.}}
