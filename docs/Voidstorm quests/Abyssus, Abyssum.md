==Objectives==
Conquer Terminas' arena.
*Enemies slaughtered (30)
*Fight Alleria Windrunner

==Description==
I don't see [[Decimus]]. For all their glee at handing us over, I'd expect they'd want to watch the fight. What could be more important to a [[domanaar]] than enjoying a battle?

<Alleria nocks another arrow.>

Answers can wait. Right now we need to survive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*17,875 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Lothraxion]]'s going to tear the nexus-points apart even if it costs us [[Silvermoon]]!

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Weapons ready, we'll make ourselves an opening and deal with Decimus afterward.}}

You are given the abilities which are in a rotation: 
#{{Abilities|id=1230810|Sacred Armaments|icon=inv_ability_lightsmithpaladin_holybulwark|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] infuses you with his light, shielding you and blessing your attacks with Holy damage.}}
#{{Abilities|id=1231995|Called Shot|icon=inv_cosmicvoid_missile|Alleria fires a void arrow to your position, inflicting high damage to enemies between you and her.}}
#{{Abilities|id=1231784|Lothraxion's Holy Flame|icon=spell_holy_searinglight|Signal [[Lothraxion]] to bombard a location with holy fire.}}

The Mobs you are to slay are the [[Starved Voidwalker]]s, [[Dwindling Wraith]]s, [[Scathing Voidcaller]]s, [[Baleful Subjugator]]s, [[Gaunt Harrower]]s, [[Swarming Pitspawn]]s, & [[Enraged Ultradon]]s.

Upon slaying 10 mobs,
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Trusting Decimus was madness!}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I don't understand, they could have betrayed us at any time.}}

Upon slaying 20 mobs,
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|I knew you were blind to the Void's schemes!}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|No, something's not right. Decimus would not miss this spectacle.}}

Upon slaying 30 mobs,
:{{Text|Say|Terminas|Such dull camaraderie. You shall learn your place as Decimus has.}}
:''Terminas sustains the party.''
:{{Text|Say|Terminas|Fight one another or die. I will cull these weak distractions.}}
:''The adventurer is launched into a force field made by Arator.''
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|This was Decimus's plan. Keep Terminas' eyes on us, <name>.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Are you mad, Alleria?}}

Upon confronting Alleria Windrunner
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I've seen you fight, <name>. I know you can do more.}}

Upon depleting her health to 60%,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Entertained, Terminas? Come down here if you dare.}}

Upon depleting her health to 30%,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Not bad, but it's time to end this.}}

A [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Decimus Saves the Party" starts playing
:''Alleria aims her arrow at Terminas and shoots but Terminas deflected that.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Terminas|I see now why Xal'atath is so fascinated by you mortals.}}
:''Suddenly Terminas grunts in pain as a blast hits him at the rear. It was Decimus who now donned the Mantle of Predation.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Terminas|Decimus?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Terminas|My mantle...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Decimus|It suits me, yes?}}
:''Decimus delivers the final blow to Terminas as he emits a painful scream as he turns into the remaining essences. Decimus walk towards the remains.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Decimus|Now for the victory feast.}}
:''Decimus devours it and becomes larger.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Decimus|As for my dear guests...}}
:''Decimus teleports Alleria Windrunner, Lothraxion, Arator, and the Adventurer out of the arena.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Decimus|Pardon the deception.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Decimus|You made an exquisite distraction.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lothraxion|A distraction?!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lothraxion|I will annihilate you!}}
:''Lothraxion starts nearing Decimus but Alleria intervenes.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Lothraxion, hold!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|We have what we need to finish this.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Decimus|And you still need me--}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Decimus|--only a domanaar can use the mantle.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Decimus|Surely I mentioned that?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lothraxion|How many betrayals before you see the truth?!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lothraxion|He is playing us for fools!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Decimus is not our enemy!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lothraxion|You are ALL blind!}}
:''Lothraxion looks at the adventurer as he shouts that. Lothraxion begins to take flight.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lothraxion|I will tear the Nexus-Points apart}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lothraxion|and end this accursed storm once and for all!}}
:''Lothraxion flies out.''

On the other side of the cutscene, [[Lady Darkglen]], [[Riftblade Maella]], & [[Riftwalker Sideras]] are also teleported out of the arena.
