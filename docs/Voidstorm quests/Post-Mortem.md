*[[Overwhelmed Scout]]s Assisted (3)
*Check with [[Lothraxion]]
*Check with [[Decimus]]

==Description==
We all bear a heavy burden in this place. I feel myself slipping towards hopelessness. But we haven't failed until we refuse to stand back up. I know my mother will collect herself. But the others need to know this fight isn't over.

Speak with Hieron. He and the other scouts should have information. We can start there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|11|70}}
*7,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What was that...?

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Arator, you must ensure that no harm comes to Decimus. They have the answers we need. Trust me.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I do. I will.}}

Alleria has a {{Gossip|<Stay awhile and Listen.>}} option,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|The dark naaru within you, mother... I never understood just how exhausting it must be to maintain control over it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Or how lonely it's been for you, protecting us from it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|For you, my son, I could endure anything. I know at times, I have been somewhat... cold.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Stop. Don't apologize for--}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I need you to hear me, Arator. Understand, it's not the naaru within me that creates the distance between us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|It's the fight. I know.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|But you need to understand. You can't protect me from what's out there. And you can't scare me away, either. My fight is by your side.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|What comes, mother, we will face together.}}
:{{Text|Emote|Alleria gazes at Arator with a mournful expression and then looks away.}}

Head to Riftwalker Hieron and speak to him.
{{Dialogue|<Hieron is too concerned with [[Riftblade Astre|Astre]] to notice your approach.>

{{Gossip|quest=|<Ask for his report on the wilds.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Riftwalker Hieron|Stay with us, Astre. Feel my hand in yours.}}
:''Some void stuff spew from Astre's face.''
:{{Text|Say|Riftwalker Hieron|I'm sorry, but I need a little longer with them. Check with Maella. Her report is more thorough than mine anyway.}}

Head to Riftblade Maella and speak with her.
{{Dialogue|<name>. I'm relieved to see that you and Lady Windrunner have returned.

We have found that our people are uniquely suited to survive and push back the Voidstorm. But too, we are uniquely vulnerable to the allure of its power.

{{Gossip|<Ask for her report on the wilds.>}}
}}
:''Maella give you [[Maella's Report]]''.
:{{Text|Say|Riftblade Maella|Here. Hieron is too modest. You can tell him I said that.}}
:{{Text|Say|Riftblade Maella|The whispers grow evermore enticing, but we stand strong. Our mission demands it.}}

Assist the Overwhelmed Scout who is by the rock,
:{{Text|Say|Overwhelmed Scout|You're right. I should sit with the others.}}

Assist the Overwhelmed Scout who is near [[Lady Darkglen]]
:{{Text|Say|Overwhelmed Scout|W-Who's there? Stay away!}} 

Upon subduing her,
:{{Text|Say|Lady Darkglen|Dust yourself off, ren'dorei. You have not succumbed yet.}}

Assist the Overwhelmed Assistant near the crates,
:{{Text|Say|Overwhelmed Scout|These whispers suffocate my senses.}}

Head to Lothraxion and speak with him
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|quest=|<Ask how Lothraxion is doing.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|How could this have gone so wrong? We're no closer to bringing the forces of the Light to bear on this world.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|You must feel it too, <name>. A waiting betrayal. I know what must be done.}}

Head to Decimus and speak with him
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|quest=|<Explain yourself.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|You and Lady Windrunner are simply wonderful. I've not encountered such capable mortals in my many travels.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|I gave you my protection for one simple reason. I'm eager to see what violence you may next wreak.}}

Return to Arator & Alleria Windrunner,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|About your father. When he-- Wait. Did you hear that?}}

Upon completion,
:{{Text|Yell|Lothraxion|You've been subverting us all along! Be eradicated, Decimus!}}
