==Objectives==
Slay Slavering Ultradons by marking them with Carrion Essence.
*Gather Carrion Essence from slain creatures to weaken ultradons (Optional)
*[[Slavering Ultradon]] slain (5)

==Description==
[[Lothraxion]]'s acting like we have an army, but a single ultradon will tear through us if we're caught off guard. We need to be smarter.

I've watched the beasts of this world. Studied them, tracked them, killed them. They prey on weakness, cull their own kind at the first sign of frailty.

Harvest Carrion Essence from the carcasses around the citadel. Use it to mark ultradons. Other beasts will pounce, thinking they're wounded or dying. Let them tear each other apart, then clean up what's left.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*14,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good hunting. With the ultradons dead, we may just be able to get out of here alive.

==Notes==
Upon accepting '''All Become Prey''' from Alleria Windrunner, [[Vanished in the Void]] from [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]], & [[Hollow Hunger]] from [[Lothraxion]],
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Remain here, Lothraxion. You've already put this mission at risk.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Risk? You trust the word of a domanaar over mine.}}

Slay the [[Obscurion Tormentor]]s, [[Void-Yoked Shredclaw]]s, [[Obscurion Subjugator]]s, [[Prowling Harrower]]s, [[Ravenous Voidwalker]]s, [[Scavenging Harrower]]s, & [[Scouring Voidshaper]] and loot the [[Carrion Essence]]s from them. Use them on the Slavering Ultradon to turn on them or slay them.

After that, return to the party
:{{Text|Say|Arator|<name>, where's [[Riftwalker Hieron|Hieron]]? Is he...?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|War is no place for a tender heart, boy.}}

[[Lady Darkglen]] has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|<Lady Darkglen glowers at Lothraxion.>

That bastard's lucky Alleria is here. As soon as we're done, he'll answer for what happened to Hieron.}}

So too does [[Riftblade Maella]]
{{Dialogue|<Maella maintains a white-knuckle grip on her blade.>

I won't let this place take any more of my people.}}

Especially [[Riftwalker Sideras]]
{{Dialogue|<Sideras gives you a wry smile, then winces and clutches his side.>

Never thought I'd serve under another Windrunner. Seems to be going about as well as last time.}}
