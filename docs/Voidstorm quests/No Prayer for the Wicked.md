==Objectives==
Help modify the Shadowgraft Fragments, slay Sinewshredder in [[Nexus-Point Antius]], and capture the leading domanaar.
*[[Grafting Metal|Shadowgraft Fragments]] modified
*[[Sinewshredder]] slain
*[[Decimus|Domanaar]] pursued through the [[Stellar Vortex]]
*Stay awhile and listen to Alleria (Optional)

==Description==
Alleria has a plan to use this shadowgrafting material to capture that domanaar for information.

But what good is information given by evil? I've fought countless demons and every one of them was a liar.

<Lothraxion scowls.>

Let us follow her plan, for now. Do what she asks with this metal, then slay the domanaar's pet beast.

Once we speak with this vile creature, I will decide how long it lives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*17,655 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You've done good work, <name>.

==Notes==

Place the Grafting Metal and the Shadowgraft Fragmets were modified.
:''Alleria walks up to the metal and kneels.''
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Light and Shadow, two sides of the same coin. With enough of a push, Light can become Shadow.}}
:''[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] walks up to the metal and uses his light on the metal before kneeling.''
:{{Text|Say|Arator|And Shadow can become Light. I see, mother. We can use their own materials to bind and capture that domanaar.}}
:''Arator and Alleria races off followed by Lothraxion.''

Follow the trio to the Leading Domaanar. Alleria is shooting her arrows at the Domanaar whilst Lothraxion is sustaining it whilst Arator is shielding Lothraxion.
:{{Text|Say|Leading Domanaar|Azerothians! Oh, you'll make exquisite trophies.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Take down its pet, <name>!}}

Upon slaying Sinewshredder,
:{{Text|Say|Leading Domanaar|My, what a delicious bloodbath! But I'm afraid I must take my leave.}}
:''Leading Domanaar runs off into the Stellar Vortex''
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|No! After it!}}
:''Lothraxion, Arator, & Alleria went into the Vortex.''

Go into the vortex and  a [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "The Party Captures Decimus" starts playing:
:''The Leading Domanaar was chased by Alleria Windrunner, Arator, & the Adventurer until Lothraxion stopped it in its tracks. Lothraxion nears the Domanaar.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lothraxion|Nowhere left to run, voidspawn.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Decimus|Indeed. I can see the position I'm in and I can see yours.}}
:''Decimus turn towards Alleria Windrunner.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Decimus|Your elite little cadre need something I have:}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Decimus|Information on Xal'atath's machinations.}}
:''Alleria smiles''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lothraxion|We need nothing from the likes of you!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Stay your hand, Lothraxion.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|That thing is right.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Lothraxion|You would trust such a creature?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Not at all.}}
:''Alleria Windrunner walks back as Arator carries the golden ring''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|But I trust that it wants to survive.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|You will tell us all you know.}}
:''The Leading Domanaar turns away as Arator places the ring behind it.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|And I will know if you lie.}}
:''The Leading Domanaar turn towards Alleria.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Decimus|Please, fair lady. You may call me Decimus.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Decimus|I am at your service.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, Lothraxion gives Decimus a warning
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|One wrong move and I will sear you with the Light, fiend.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Such strength and wisdom! Clearly, it would be foolish to defy you!}}
:''Alleria Windrunner, Arator, Lothraxion, & Decimus stars walking to the Ingress.''

Head to the Ingress.
:{{Text|Say|[[Riftblade Maella]]|Our scouts discovered an ethereal manaforge due south. Not sure what they're up to, though.}}


Decimus has a gossip,
{{Dialogue|My, I haven't experienced such uncouth behavior from a guest since... Well. I shouldn't say.

I know when I'm beaten. Let's be civilized, now.

{{gossip|<Ask for more information about the domanaar.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|Decimus

Why, we domanaar are simply creatures of evil and darkness as your Lightforged friend so aptly points out!

Certainly there is no more to us than our desire to devour every delicious drop of suffering your mortal heart elicits.

It is beyond our wicked hearts to craft sophisticated structures, tend to splendid gardens, or regale each other with tales of the distant worlds to which we venture.

<Decimus leans forward and eyes your weapon with obvious delight.>

And the fine, fine craftsmanship of their denizens.

No, no. We yearn only to lead Xal'atath's Devouring Host and slay brave heroes in her name.

<Decimus looks you over and grins hungrily.>

How could we turn down such a scrumptious meal?

{{Gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}
}}
}}

Speak with Alleria:
{{Dialogue|Alleria Windrunner

<Alleria looks distracted for a moment before fixing her gaze on you.>

It's good to have support here. We must crush Xal'atath's plans.

{{Gossip|quest=|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}

{{Gossip|<Ask Alleria if she is certain working with this Void creature is wise.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|Alleria Windrunner

I know. After what happened in K'aresh...

Locus-Walker convinced us to work with Xal'atath and I argued against trusting a Void monster at every turn.

And was I right to? Locus-Walker is gone. But had we not worked with Xal'atath, Dimensius would have devoured all. Or would we have found another way?

If I had trusted Locus-Walker from the start, could I have prevented his death?

During the coldest nights I've spent here, I don't sleep. I only ask myself these questions.

I had told Locus-Walker that he was no longer my mentor. But it's not true. Here... I shall accept a lesson of his once more.

A Void creature has only one goal: survival. And we can make that knowledge fight for us.

:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Tell me of [[Silvermoon]], Arator. How bad was it?}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Honestly, if not for the Light forces intervening when they did, we would have lost everything.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I see. And [[Turalyon|your father]], is he well?}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|He... I fear the Light... blinds him, Mother. In his rage, he... he [[Past Redemption|struck]] down an innocent.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Who, Arator?}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|That... doesn't matter now. What matters is that if the Light can turn someone like him wrathful...}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|You fear succumbing to it yourself.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I already did, fighting the Void. You see these embers I bear? I burned myself in wrath. They remain as a reminder.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Of what?}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|That there's something... wrong with the Light.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|That thought terrifies me more than the Void ever could.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|If I've learned anything from fighting beside your father, it's that the Light is strongest when rooted in love and compassion.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Those two things, Arator, just happen to be your greatest strengths. Stay true to yourself--}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|And wrath cannot overtake me. Heh. Your counsel is comforting, mother.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Well, I have had a thousand years of practice, kid.}}
