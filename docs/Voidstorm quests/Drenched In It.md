==Objectives==

*[[Offworlder Refugee|Offworlder]]s splashed with blood (8)
*Splash yourself in front of the [[Improvised Waygate]]

==Description==
;Non-draenei
<Tul'amar looks away from the blood-soaked and mortified [[Juras the Nethersent|Juras]] and towards the portal as it flickers to life. She reads it with her powers of the arcane.>

Good. Blood is vio... violent? Violent is power. Need more. Now, brothers and sisters.

<She gestures to the blood in your possession, and then to her people. Many of them return wary looks your way.>

You can. I say.

Then, go out. See of me.

;{{Race|Draenei}}/{{Race|Lightforged}}
<Tul'amar looks away from the blood-soaked and mortified Juras and towards the portal as it flickers to life. She reads it with her powers of the arcane.>

He'll get over it. Besides, my other theory required Juras and I getting into a fist-fight.

Now, you do the same to the others. The violent energies will power the portal--but attuning it will be a separate matter. When you're done here, meet me on the domanaar rise above. With you here, we can finally take what we need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 6,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
;Non-draenei
Good. Now, more. Brothers and sisters, help.

And men of Void, kill.

;{{Race|Draenei}}/{{Race|Lightforged}}
This hellish place... I was kept here for weeks before I slipped my restraints. There are far more of our kin here than when last I chanced a visit.

Now, we save our brothers and sisters. And kill these monsters.

:''Tul'amar turns invisible and heads out.''

Use the Violent Infusion on the Offworlder Refugees. There's also the [[Gentle Paa'he]] who you should drench.

Once that's finished splash yourself in front of the Improvised Waygate.

Head to the [[Masters' Perch]] and speak with Tul'amar.

Tul'amar has a gossip after completion,
