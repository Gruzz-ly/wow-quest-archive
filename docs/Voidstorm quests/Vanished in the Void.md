==Objectives==
Find the missing void elves.
*[[Riftblade Maella]] found
*[[Lady Darkglen]] found
*[[Riftwalker Hieron]] found
*Hieron's Journal

==Description==
"Acceptable losses," I hope I never find it that easy to dismiss the deaths of friends and comrades. What use is the light if it leaves us as callous as our enemies?

Sideras was nearly killed. Luckily he escaped through a rift. Riftblade Maella led the others in a fighting retreat. Find her, hopefully they stuck together.

I can't leave Sideras, not until he's stable.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*14,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This isn't right, Hieron didn't come here to die. The Light should protect people, not lead them to their deaths.

<Arator seems lost in thought.>

Thank you. I'll make sure to give his journal to the others.

==Notes==
Upon accepting [[All Become Prey]] from [[Alleria Windrunner]], '''Vanished in the Void''' from Arator, & [[Hollow Hunger]] from [[Lothraxion]],
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Remain here, Lothraxion. You've already put this mission at risk.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Risk? You trust the word of a domanaar over mine.}}

Head to Riftblade Maella who is battling an ultradon,
:{{Text|Yell|Riftblade Maella|Stop wasting my time!}}
:''Maella delivers the killing blow.''

Speak with Maella,
{{Dialogue|The ultradons had our scent as soon as we passed the main gate. We were separated--Lothraxion didn't even look back.

{{Gossip|quest=|Regroup with Alleria and Arator.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Riftblade Maella|I was separated from Hieron and Lady Darkglen. You must find them.}}

Go to Lady Darkglen who is strangling the Shredclaws with her void tentacles.
{{Dialogue|The ultradons might have had me if Hieron hadn't distracted them.

The Void he unveiled, it was like an eclipse.

{{Gossip|quest=|I'll find Hieron. Regroup with the others.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Lady Darkglen|Find that old fool. I'll give him an earful for playing hero.}}

Head to Riftwalker Hieron who is laying in his dying breaths,
:{{Text|Say|Riftwalker Hieron|Tried to lure them away. Worked a little too well.}}
{{Dialogue|I tried to give the others an opening.

<Hieron breathes heavily.>

Nearly had it 'til the last few showed up. Did they make it?

{{Gossip|quest=|Darkglen and Maella are fine.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Riftwalker Hieron|Good. Tell Astre I'm sorry. I don't think I'll make it back in time for tea.}}
:''Hieron vanishes.''

Obtain Hieron's Journal and return to the party
:{{Text|Say|Arator|<name>, where's [[Riftwalker Hieron|Hieron]]? Is he...?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|War is no place for a tender heart, boy.}}

Lady Darkglen has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|<Lady Darkglen glowers at Lothraxion.>

That bastard's lucky Alleria is here. As soon as we're done, he'll answer for what happened to Hieron.}}

So too does Riftblade Maella
{{Dialogue|<Maella maintains a white-knuckle grip on her blade.>

I won't let this place take any more of my people.}}

Especially [[Riftwalker Sideras]]
{{Dialogue|<Sideras gives you a wry smile, then winces and clutches his side.>

Never thought I'd serve under another Windrunner. Seems to be going about as well as last time.}}
