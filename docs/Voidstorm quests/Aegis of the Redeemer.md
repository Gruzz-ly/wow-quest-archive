==Objectives==
Rescue the beleaguered vanguard forces.
*[[Vanguard Scout|Vanguard Forces]] Rescued (3)

==Description==
We're more than just an army, <name>, even if [[Turalyon|my father]] doesn't see that.

We're a fellowship, joined by a desire to protect those that matter to us, and those that don't have a protector of their own.

And now, that protection extends to those wounded on the battlefield.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Voidbreaker's Leggings]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Pants]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Legguards]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Faulds]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*3,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We were able to save so few, <name>.

I'm pleased at the work we did, but I wish we could have done more.

==Notes==
Upon accepting [[The Memory Remains]] & '''Aegis of the Redeemer''',
:{{Text|Say|Arator|The Vanguard has rushed out full of conviction. and its soldiers return here to the infirmary.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|We need to get out there and help those still on the battlefield.}}

Head to the couple of Vanguard Scouts and then interact with the Vanguard Scout at the first group,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Heal within the protection of my Light! We will defend you!}}

Upon protecting the first group,
:{{Text|Say|Vanguard Scout|Moving out! Light bless you!}}

Upon interacting with the second Vanguard Scout at the second group,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Heal as quickly as you can. Regroup at Muster Point! <Name>, defend them!}}

Upon protecting the second group,
:{{Text|Say|Vanguard Scout|We would have died if not for you!}}

Upon interacting with the Third Vanguard Scout at the Third group,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|The Light will protect us, but we should make haste!}}

Upon protecting the Third group,
:{{Text|Say|Vanguard Scout|Thank you! We'll regroup for the next assault.}}

Make sure you turn in both quests to Arator.
