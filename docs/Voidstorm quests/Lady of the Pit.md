==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Torentia.jpg|Torentia|A canny and cautious domanaar. Torentia avoids fights unless she feels her authority is threatened.}}
Challenge Torentia and claim her sigil to access the vault.
*Toerntia challenged (Optional)
*[[Torentia]] defeated
*[[Torentia's Sigil]]
*Torentia's Sigil consumed

==Description==
For all their power, these domanaar still behave like beasts. That's good for us. Wolves try to avoid each other, but if one threatens another's territory they'll fight to the death.

By now, I think you've more than proven that you're a threat. Torentia can't back down if you challenge her--it would go against her nature.

So take the fight to her, slay her, and claim her sigil.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*17,875 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I've never known [[Lothraxion]] to be careless like this. Throwing lives away, charging in blind, doesn't he know he's not leading an army here?

At least you've done your part. Let's try to salvage the mission.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Challenge Torentia and claim her sigil. [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]], let's regroup with the others in the upper citadel.}}
:''Alleria Windrunner & Arator departs.''

Press deeper into the Obsurion Citadel and confront Torentia,
:{{Text|Say|Torentia|I'll feed you to the beasts.}}

Upon depleting her health to 9%,
:{{Text|Yell|Torentia|No, you won't take this from me!}}
:''Torentia retreats.''

Follow Torentia to inside the fortress.
:{{Text|Say|Torentia|Wait! I bow to your strength. Let me serve you, together we--}}
:''[[Decimus]] finishes Torentia.''
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Stirring. Some friendly advice: never trust a domanaar who feigns subservience.}}

Loot Torentia to get her sigil.
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Devour it. Feel her authority become yours.}}

Consume Torentia's sigil with the ability: {{Abilities|Consume Torentia's Sigil|id=1220622|icon=inv_nullstone_cosmicvoid|Devour the symbol of Torentia's authority to gain access to the vault.}}

:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Delicious. Already halfway to unlocking the mantle.}}

Head to the upper levels of the citadel and regroup with Alleria, Decimus, Arator who is kneeling before a wounded [[Riftwalker Sideras]], & [[Lothraxion]].
:{{Text|Yell|Alleria Windrunner|You abandoned them?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Acceptable losses. The void elves knew the risks.}}

Arator has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|<Arator presses a bandage to a ragged wound in Sideras' chest.>

If we'd arrived even a minute later, he'd already be dead.}}

So too does Decimus,
{{Dialogue|Such drama and strife. Was I wrong to believe all lightlings embraced unity and equanimity? How delicious, this is far more interesting.}}

Especially Lothraxion,
{{Dialogue|We're close to ending this. Better to dispose of Decimus now before they have the chance to betray us.}}
