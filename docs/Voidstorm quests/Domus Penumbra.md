==Objectives==
Establish your base at the Howling Ridge.
*Speak to [[Innkeeper Hospitus]]
*Hel [[Magister Umbric|Umbric]] establish a portal.
*Aid [[Riftwalker Malloril|Flight Master Malloril]].

==Description==
You wish to stop the Voidstorm and I wish to see it end. Common ground, a rare thing here. I'll even tell you how to do it, and all I ask in return is for you to let me enjoy the show.

But you must be tired. Show yourself around, help yourself to the amenities. Then we will continue our discussion.

Don't take too long. There is much to see, and the storm rages on.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|11|70}}
*7,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Comfortable? So nice to see someone appreciate my hospitality.

Now I suppose we must discuss business before your glowing friend has another tantrum.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Make yourself at home. Then we can discuss weakening the storm.}}
:''[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]], [[Alleria Windrunner]] & [[Magister Umbric]] starts following Decimus walking up the stairs with [[Lothraxion]] following after.''
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Keep your weapons close. Trust nothing the Void offers.}}

Walk to Umbric who is near [[Bent]]
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|This is the most stable place for a portal, but Decimus's beast is in the way.}}

Take the [[Well-Gnawed Bones]] and throw it from a distance so that Bent can chase it.
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|The Void feels... honed here. Perhaps the work of Decimus?}}

Head to Riftwalker Malloril who is confronting [[Mincer]].
:{{Text|Say|Riftwalker Malloril|Careful, <name>. This beast looks hungry.}}

Take the [[Fresh Meat (Voidstorm object)|Fresh Meat]] and distract Mincer.
:{{Text|Say|Riftwalker Malloril|It seems even the skies here are full of teeth.}}

Head to Innkeeper Hospitus's area where Alleria and Arator are having a conversation,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I thought you and Lothraxion were friends.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|We were--We are. He's not wrong to distrust the Void. I only wish he would trust me.}}
:''The two starts walking out of the building.''

Speak to Hospitus and then head outside and mmeet up with the gang
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Come, <name>, I have so much to show you.}}

Alleria has a gossip,
{{Dialogue|Keep your weapons close, <name>. This world's only language is violence, we have to be ready to respond in kind.}}

So too does Arator,
{{Dialogue|Decimus seems... oddly eager to help us. I'd don't relish working with someone whose motives I can't understand.}}

Especially Decimus,
{{Dialogue|Invading the seat of [[Xal'atath]]'s host with such a paltry force. Is it delightful arrogance or pitiful desperation?

{{Gossip|<Ask about the Mantle of Predation.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|Is this earnest curiosity, or do I detect a hint of suspicion? You injure me, friend. I've been open and forthcoming as blood from a wound.

The Mantle of Predation is craved by many, but it must be earned. Xal'atath grants it to whomever climbs the cosmic ladder, each rung built from the bones of their prey.

Alas, it's a troublesome gift. Power attracts power, and so whoever possesses it must always be cautious, always waiting for fangs to sink into their neck. Perhaps that's why Xal'atath enjoys handing it out. What better way to keep her servants sharp and paranoid?

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
