==Objectives==
Bring the holokey to Alleria deeper in the Ethereum Refinery.
*[[Cracked Holokey]]

==Description==
<A unique-looking ethereal device rests upon the cold ground. It bears a crack down the middle from damage in a scuffle.> 

<Perhaps Alleria will know what it is.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*14,135 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I've seen one of these before. Ethereals use them to encrypt communications.

Excellent find, <name>.

==Notes==
While in the area for [[Work Disruption]] & [[First, The Shells]], keep an eye out for the [[Cracked Holokey]] that starts '''A Cracked Holokey'''.

Meet back with Alleria, [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]], [[Decimus]] & [[Lothraxion]] after,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|You live up to your legend, mother.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|And you fight well. But don't be in a rush to make your own.}}

Alleria has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|Being with my son again after so long. I'm glad. But I wish it felt...

<Alleria looks away suddenly, wincing. She shakes it off with a sigh.>

There's no time. All of us need to stay focused on the mission.}}

Make sure you turn in three quests.
