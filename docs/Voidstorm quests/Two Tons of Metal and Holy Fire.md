==Objectives==
Piloting the Warframe, destroy defenders along the Voidspire ramparts.
*Warframe Mounted
*Voidspire Defenders Destroyed (0/100%)

==Description==
Finally, the might of our warframes can be brought to bear.

With the Overcroft's air batteries silenced, our powerful warframes will be able to perform strafing runs along the spire ramparts, softening the opposition to our siege.

If you'd like, you may have the honor of piloting one of these warframes for the glory of the light!

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Voidbreaker's Bracers (quest reward)]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Wristwraps]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Clasps]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Armguards]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*3,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Soon, the devouring host will feel the wrath of the light.

==Completion==
That should soften them up a bit, and make our upcoming assault easier.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|<Name>, report to [[Commander Koruth Mountainfist|Commander Mountainfist]]. We'd be honored if you would join the Warframe assault.}}

Upon nearing the Assault Warframe
:{{Text|Say|Commander Koruth Mountainfist|The Void cannons had us squattin' in aditch since we got here. Seems only fair we return the favor. Care to give it a go?}}

Commander Koruth Mountainfist has a gossip
{{Dialogue|I praise the light like any other in its service, <name>.

But I also put on heavy armor and bring some war machines.}}

Hop on the Warframe and fill the bar up by slaying the [[Domanaar Caster]]s (5%), [[Voidbound Obliterator]]s (5%), [[Abyssal Caller]]s (5%), [[Stronghold Maleficus]] (5%) & [[Shadowguard Flickerblade]]s (5%)

Upon completion,
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|Check in with [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] if you haven't had a chance yet. He's over on the other side of camp, tending to the wounded.}}
