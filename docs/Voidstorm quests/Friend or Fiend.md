==Objectives==
Travel to the Howling Ridge.
*Travel to the Howling Ridge
*Stay a while and listen to [[Lothraxion]] (Optional)

==Description==
Despite that spirited display, I'm inclined to help you. After all, what's a little violence between friends?

And since we're friends, I'll let you in on a secret: shutting down the storm is only possible from inside the nexus-points. Of course you can't just walk in--you need the Mantle of Predation.

<Decimus seems to savor the words.>

Do I have your attention? Let's shake the dust off and discuss this somewhere... civilized. Meet me at my estate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,815 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Guests are a rare treat for a domanaar. Especially ones that come of their own accord.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|You'd follow this creature to its foul den?}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|If you prefer to keep throwing naaru at nexus-points, don't let me stop you.}}
:''[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] and Decimus starts walking off while [[Alleria Windrunner]] stays walking towards Lothraxion.''

Lothraxion has a {{Gossip|quest=|<Stay awhile and Listen.}} option.
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|[[T'era|A naaru]]! Dead! Now we're to trust this monstrosity?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|No, but we need them. They've had every opportunity to betray us. }}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|And they will.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Have you learned nothing from [[K'aresh]]? What did your mentor's trust in the Void bring him?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Careful. The Void never offers fair choices. Locus-Walker understood that better than anyone.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|After his demise, I asked myself again and again what I could have done to prevent it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|But then I came to realize what [[Locus-Walker]] knew from the start. It didn't matter that Xal'atath was always going to turn on us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|If the only way to stop one monster is to work with another, what choice is there?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|We've fought together for a thousand years. Do you not trust me?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I do, Lothraxion. When Decimus does betray us, I trust you to put them down.}}

Travel to [[Howling Ridge]] and meet up with Decimus, Lothraxion, Arator, Alleria Windrunner, & [[Magister Umbric]]
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Ah, the rest of our party arrives. Were there time, I'd have you for dinner.}}

Lothraxion has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|Do not let the apparent civility deceive you. This "estate" is as foul as the rest of this place.}}

So too does Decimus
{{Dialogue|Invading the seat of Xal'atath's host with such a paltry force. Is it delightful arrogance or pitiful desperation?}}
