==Objectives==
Survey Voidstorm with Lothraxion and [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]].
*Voidstorm surveyed
*Speak with [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]]

==Description==
We have secured this location. Some void elves can make this into a proper camp.

There must be some weakness we can exploit to stop the storm. We must bring my army here to mete out justice to [[Xal'atath]]'s armies!

Join me and young [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]. Let us see what we can gather from this place across the horizon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The rest of the void elves have been dispersed to set up camps or scout.

I am... conflicted over Alleria's presence. Her skills and experience are unspeakably valuable, and yet...

The Void in her is so strong... I worry. Keep an eye on her.

The Void can NEVER be trusted.

;Void elf
The rest of your fellow void elves have been dispersed to set up camps or scout.

I am... conflicted over Alleria's presence. Much like you, her skills and experience are unspeakably valuable, and yet...

Even moreso than you, the Void in her is so strong... I worry. Keep an eye on her.

The Void can NEVER be trusted.

==Notes==
Speak with Lothraxion,
{{Dialogue|I have seen hundreds, no, thousands, of worlds across the Great Dark Beyond.

We fought the Legion. These were worlds plunged into war and darkness.

And yet, still, none were like this. This foul taste in the mouth, this chill.

There is something ever darker here. Xal'atath.

A [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "A Reunion between the Lady of the Void and the Redeemer" starts playing:

:''The adventurer, Arator, and Lothraxion look out over Voidstorm, including Xal'atath's seat of power, the Voidspire''
:''Arator turns to look at the Karion''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|Look out!}}
:''Arator cuts down the Karions until he looks at a colossal Trigore. Arator gazed into the beast until Alleria pushes him before he could get stomped on.''
:''Arator gets his face back from the groud and looks at the Trigore walking out and then he turns to look at Alleria.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Arator?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Lothraxion...?}}
:''Arator gets back up.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|What the hell are you doing here?}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|Mother! Thank the Light...}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|I knew you were alive!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|It's too dangerous for you here, Arator!}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|The Void devours everything it touches.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|We have a mission here, mother.}}
:''Arator then gazes at the Voidspire.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Arator|And I'll stop at nothing to see it through.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|I know.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|That's what terrifies me.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, Alleria Windrunner stands before Arator.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Mother--}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|This is no place for pleasantries. We must move, quickly!}}

Arator has a gossip:
{{dialogue|She's alive! She's here!

I knew in my heart that she was still alive, gone somewhere, hunting... just like always.

<Arator smiles, somewhat sadly.>

But this time, we are here too. This time, we do this together.

{{gossip|<Ask Arator when he's planning on telling Alleria what [[Turalyon]] [[Past Redemption|did]] at the [[Amani Pass]].>}}
{{dialogue-child|<Arator grimaces.>

Not now, <name>. I only just got her back.

I will tell her. I will. Just, once we are somewhere safe. Once tempers are running a bit less high.

The last thing I want is for her to be furious with father.

So, please, <name>, keep what happened to yourself. Let me tell my mother in my own time, when it feels right.

Right now, we have a war to wage.

{{gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}

}}

Speak with Alleria,
{{Dialogue|<Alleria's eyes flick back and forth.>

Watch the skies! There is no safe place, here.

I sensed a disturbance and feared it was more of Xal'atath's forces. Instead, it's you and--and Arator.

Some time ago, I tracked Xal'atath and her ethereals to this strange place. I've been hunting her, but...

<Alleria trails off, and you notice the faint glow of purple about her.>

The Void is so powerful here. It is... distracting. Intoxicating.

But you are here. Arator is here. We must be careful.

{{Gossip|quest=|<Ask Alleria how you can help.> }}

{{Gossip|<Ask Alleria how she got here.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|I have been hunting hunting Xal'atath since we first learned of the Dark Heart. After she left Khaz Algar, I followed her to K'aresh, where she sought to prevent Dimensius' return.

I continued to follow her, even after the heroes of Azeroth were pulled away to the defense of Silvermoon. I will not relent.

She allowed the Shadowguard ethereals back into her ranks. As she opened the way for them into this strange place, I slipped through.

In the chaos of this storm, I did not have a way back. But I didn't need a way back. My quarry is here.

:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Understand, Alleria, that I lead this mission. But your aid is welcome.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Good, since you will likely die without it. Now listen.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Powerful entities called [[domanaar]] command the Host in Xal'atath's name. One monitors a Nexus-Point nearby, but I haven't gotten close.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Then that is our first target. We must weaken the storm and our foes! Move out!}}

Meet Lothraxion, Alleria, and Arator at the [[Nexus-Point Antius]].
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|You shouldn't be here, Arator. The Void is too powerful.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Then we'll fight it together. I'm not leaving you.}}
