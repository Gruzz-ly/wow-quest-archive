==Objectives==
Meet the ren'dorei scouts near the [[Obscurion Citadel]].
*Listen to the scouting report

==Description==
I don't trust [[Decimus]] any more than the rest of the beasts here. I do trust that they only serve themself. Seems having [[Xal'atath]] as a master isn't to their taste. We can turn one foe against another. Even Lothraxion would agree if he weren't so stubborn.

If this [[Mantle of Predation]] will let us stop the storm then it's our best shot. A troop of ren'dorei have been scouting the Obscurion Citadel. We'll meet with them and see what they've learned.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*1,815 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I've avoided this place until now. The howls and the stench are carried on the wind like a warning.

==Completion==
I don't like dividing our forces. Not when this much is at stake.

Let's not rush in like [[Lothraxion]]. See what Decimus knows. I'd rather not hunt a domanaar unprepared.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Make haste. We should have the Mantle before Terminas returns to his citadel.}}
:''Alleria Windrunner, [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]], Lothraxion, & Decimus runs out.''

Head to the Obscurion Citadel and meet up with the party who are with [[Riftblade Maella]], [[Lady Darkglen]], [[Riftwalker Hieron]],  & [[Riftwalker Sideras]].
:{{Text|Say|Riftblade Maella|In his absence, Terminas' lieutenants control access to his vault.}}

Decimus has a gossip,
{{Dialogue|Smell that? The delicious, charnel house stench of Obscurion Citadel. A bit unrefined for my tastes, but it has a certain violent charm.

{{Gossip|<Ask about [[Torentia]].>}}
{{Dialogue-child|Dear [[Torentia]], a sad excuse for a domanaar. You know she once tried to claim the Mantle herself? [[Terminas]] found the attempt so amusing that he allowed her to live and made her one of his lieutenants. Torentia must forever guard that which she's too weak to possess. Now, survey her domain. A pit of blood-starved beasts and weak voidlings, easily dissipated. Yet she clings to it, like a dying mortal clings to life.

{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
}}

{{Gossip|<Ask about [[Severum]].>}}
{{Dialogue-child|A domanaar of disturbing hunger. Don't misunderstand me, friend, hunger is [[Severum]]'s right. However, one needs a mind to savor each unique delicacy. Severum is a yawning pit, nothing more. Truth be told, I think Terminas keeps him around just to annoy Torentia. She can't stand seeing someone so mindless above her in the hierarchy.

Speak with Riftblade Maella,
{{Dialogue|We took the liberty of scouting while you were at the [[Howling Ridge]]. There's a disturbing concentration of Void creatures here.

{{Gossip|quest=|<Hear the scouting report.>}}

:{{Text|Say|Riftblade Maella|Torentia controls the trench, Severum guards the upper citadel.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|I'll hunt down Severum. You and this voidspawn can handle the trench.}}
:''Lothraxion flies off.''
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|This is no time to go off on your own!}}
:{{Text|Say|Riftblade Maella|We'll follow him, my lady. Ren'dorei, with me.}}
:''The Void elves departed.''
