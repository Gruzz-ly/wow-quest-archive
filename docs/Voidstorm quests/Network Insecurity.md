==Objectives==
Use the holokey on consoles around the Ethereum Refinery.
*Decode the First Message
*Decode the Second Message
*Decode the Third Message
*Decode the Final Message
*[[Encrypted Device|Final Message]] Recovered

==Description==
Judging by the design and the strength of this holokey's energy, it must be used to encrypt important communications.

Let us try this lead. See if it's compatible with any of the consoles you find around the refinery. Given the damage it's taken, we'll have to piece together whatever scraps of information we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*14,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
Xal'atath.

Let us see this final message.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both [[Second, The Fuel]] from [[Lothraxion]] &  '''Network Insecurity''' from Alleria Windrunner,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Xal'atath doesn't spare her enemies without a reason. Find out what the ethereals are doing here.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|What does it matter? Salvage what we need and then raze this forge to the ground. They can burn with their secrets.}}

Head to the first [[Ethereal Console]] and intercept it. The Echo Missives of [[Nexus-King Salhadaar]] & [[Xal'atath]] appear.
:{{Text|Say|Echo-Missive of Salhadaar|This is not what I was promised! We toil endlessly while your monsters monitor our every move!}}
:{{Text|Say|Echo-Missive of Xal'atath|Such ingratitude is unbecoming of you Salhadaar. I have provided you with a rare gift: an opportunity to prove your right to rule.}}

Head down to the second Ethereal Console and intercept it.
:{{Text|Say|Echo-Missive of Salhadaar|Do you think I cannot see the trap you have set? The peril that now faces my people should our operation at Mid'ar fail?}}
:{{Text|Say|Echo-Missive of Xal'atath|Oh, there's no "trap" to be sprung here. You need merely succeed at your task, and all will be well. For both you... and your people.}}

Head up to the third Ethereal Console and intercept it.
:{{Text|Say|Echo-Missive of Salhadaar|The Shadowguard risk everything to strengthen the Devouring Host. Should Windrunner discover what we are doing--}}
:{{Text|Say|Echo-Missive of Xal'atath|Then it would be in your best interest to eliminate her, wouldn't it? You've let her scurry around for far too long as it is.}}

Head into the Manaforge and intercept the last Console, but then the [[Tempest Keeper]] appears. Confront it and Lothraxion appears.
:{{Text|Say|Tempest Keeper|More power. All will become Void.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Burn in the Light, wretch!}}

Slay the Tempest Keeper & loot the Encrypted Device.
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|The Light prevails. I expect [[Decimus]] puts up even less of a fight.}}

Head to Lothraxion & Alleria and turn in both quests.

Upon Completion,
:{{Text|Say|Echo-Missive of Salhadaar|Windrunner will not prevent me from turning the [[naaru]] to the Void. I will claim the power I was promised!}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|They've taken a naaru prisoner? We cannot allow these monsters to possess a being of pure Light!}}

Alleria has two new gossips
:{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|Tell me about the naaru.}}
{{Dialogue-child|Many see the naaru and think of the Light made manifest. But I know firsthand that they are not so easily defined.

I was not born with the magical abilities you've seen me wield. I claimed my true strength from a darkened naaru, L'ura, who now dwells inside of me. She is the source of my Void powers.

Mastering her and channeling her energies has been a long and difficult journey. A journey that's given me the power to protect those I cherish.

Lothraxion is right to think that a naaru on our side could turn the tides against Xal'atath.

{{Gossip|Play Movie=|<See how Alleria absorbed the naaru L'ura.>}} (This will show a pre-rendered cutscene from after defeating [[L'ura]] in the [[Seat of the Triumvirate (instance)|Seat of the Triumvirate]])

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}

{{Gossip|Tell me more about Nexus-King Salhadaar.}}
{{Dialogue-child|Nexus-King Salhadaar rules what remains of the Shadowguard--ethereals who recklessly wield the Void. He was one of [[Dimensius]]'s most loyal followers.

When we [[Nexus-King Salhadaar (tactics)|defeated]] him in [[Manaforge Omega]], Xal'atath stole him into the Dark Heart. Somehow, he escaped, only to return to her service by choice.

Salhadaar may have once styled himself a conqueror, but now he is little more than Xal'atath's beaten pawn.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}
}}

Lothraxion also has a new gossip:
{{Dialogue|There is no time to waste. Each wasted moment risks defeat.

{{Gossip|Tell me about the naaru.}}
{{Dialogue-child|The naaru are born of Light. Beacons of hope and strength for the weak hearts of mortals. They are gods among men, above you and I.

I know not from where the ethereals or Devouring Host captured a naaru. Stolen from a far-flung world, or perhaps taken prisoner from a millennia-old draenei splinter faction. Damnable renegades. But that heresy matters little in comparison to the situation at hand.

We must come to the aid of this naaru before the worst can come. With their radiance on our side, the Voidstorm's end is an inevitability.
