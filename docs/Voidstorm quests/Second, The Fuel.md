==Objectives==
Collect 50 Arcane Remnants in the Ethereum Refinery.
*[[Arcane Remnant (Voidstorm)]] (50)

==Description==
Ethereals seek corners of the cosmos to drain of potent nether. Arcane, Void, fel--to them, it matters only the yield. And we have a rich vein to work with.

Now, slay those who possess that energy. Wild arcane elementals from their pipes, or their ethereal harvesters flush with energy. We have need of it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*14,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Go. Collect the catalyst.

==Completion==
Potent. I can feel the energy--radiant. Glorious.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both '''Second, The Fuel''' from Lothraxion &  [[Network Insecurity]] from [[Alleria Windrunner]],
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Xal'atath doesn't spare her enemies without a reason. Find out what the ethereals are doing here.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|What does it matter? Salvage what we need and then raze this forge to the ground. They can burn with their secrets.}}

Slay the [[Conflux Monstrosity|Conflux Monstrosities]], [[Forge Manacapturer]]s, [[Mana Coalescence]]s, [[Manaforge Engineer]]s, & [[Manaforge Netherrider]]s and collect the Arcane Remnats from them.

Head to Lothraxion & Alleria and turn in both quests.

Upon Completion,
:{{Text|Say|Echo-Missive of Salhadaar|Windrunner will not prevent me from turning the [[naaru]] to the Void. I will claim the power I was promised!}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|They've taken a naaru prisoner? We cannot allow these monsters to possess a being of pure Light!}}

Alleria has two new gossips
:{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|Tell me about the naaru.}}
{{Dialogue-child|Many see the naaru and think of the Light made manifest. But I know firsthand that they are not so easily defined.

I was not born with the magical abilities you've seen me wield. I claimed my true strength from a darkened naaru, L'ura, who now dwells inside of me. She is the source of my Void powers.

Mastering her and channeling her energies has been a long and difficult journey. A journey that's given me the power to protect those I cherish.

Lothraxion is right to think that a naaru on our side could turn the tides against Xal'atath.

{{Gossip|Play Movie=|<See how Alleria absorbed the naaru L'ura.>}} (This will show a pre-rendered cutscene from after defeating [[L'ura]] in the [[Seat of the Triumvirate (instance)|Seat of the Triumvirate]])

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}

{{Gossip|Tell me more about [[Nexus-King Salhadaar]].}}
{{Dialogue-child|Nexus-King Salhadaar rules what remains of the Shadowguard--ethereals who recklessly wield the Void. He was one of [[Dimensius]]'s most loyal followers.

When we [[Nexus-King Salhadaar (tactics)|defeated]] him in [[Manaforge Omega]], Xal'atath stole him into the Dark Heart. Somehow, he escaped, only to return to her service by choice.

Salhadaar may have once styled himself a conqueror, but now he is little more than Xal'atath's beaten pawn.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}
}}

Lothraxion also has a new gossip:
{{Dialogue|There is no time to waste. Each wasted moment risks defeat.

{{Gossip|Tell me about the naaru.}}
{{Dialogue-child|The naaru are born of Light. Beacons of hope and strength for the weak hearts of mortals. They are gods among men, above you and I.

I know not from where the ethereals or Devouring Host captured a naaru. Stolen from a far-flung world, or perhaps taken prisoner from a millennia-old draenei splinter faction. Damnable renegades. But that heresy matters little in comparison to the situation at hand.

We must come to the aid of this naaru before the worst can come. With their radiance on our side, the Voidstorm's end is an inevitability.
