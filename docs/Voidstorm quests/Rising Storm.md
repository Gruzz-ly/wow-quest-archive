==Objectives==
De-escalate rising tensions in [[Silvermoon City]].
*[[Turalyon|High Exarch Turalyon]] consulted
*[[Vanguard of the Light]] consulted

==Description==
That was an entropic wave. We felt them just before Xal'atath launched her assault on the Sunwell.

Champion, you move faster than my best messengers. I need you to check in with the Vanguard commanders and see if their defenses will hold against this latest assault by Xal'atath's Devouring Host.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Tensions are high.

==Completion==
Well done. That Voidstorm is evoking fear and terror in everyone who sees it, myself included.

But I chose this life of standing up to evil and spitting in its face. Sadly not everyone had the luxury of that being a choice.

==Notes==
Upon approach,
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|[[Xal'atath]]'s attacks grow stronger!}}

Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|<name>, you must get to the Vanguard leaders. The Sunwell is straining against Xal'atath's assault.}}

Head to the [[Shining Span]] as [[General Amias Bellamy]], [[Commander Venel Lightblood]], [[Commander Koruth Mountainfist]], [[War Chaplain Senn]] & [[Brightstrider]] are rallying the [[Silver Hand Defender]]s, [[Hallowfall Aeroknight]]s, & the [[Guardian of the Light (Silvermoon City)|Guardians of the Light]].
:{{Text|Say|General Amias Bellamy|All Vanguard forces to the Sunwell! Now!}}


Speak with Amias,
{{Dialogue|Champion.

My time is short. What do you need?

{{gossip|quest=|Lor'themar requires a report.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Commander Koruth Mountainfist|If we could just take the fight to Xal'atath we'd give her such a drumming she's hop back inside that knife.}}
:{{Text|Say|General Amias Bellamy|Lor'themar promised his magisters would provide a solution. It's now or never!}}

Head to the upper platforms of Silvermoon and meet up with Turalyon & [[Lothraxion]].
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|Xal'atath's Voidstorm rages against the Sunwell.}}

Lothraxion has a gossip the same as [[You Know This Evil?]]

Speak with Turalyon,
{{Dialogue|The Sunwell cannot continue as it is. We are beginning to fail this stalemate.

Soon, we can expect Xal'atath to press in force.

{{gossip|quest=|Lor'themar requires a report.}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|The situation is dire! We will accept any help. Even from [[Magister Umbric]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|No! Those Void addicts are not our salvation. The Light is the only way to stop Xal'atath's evil.}}

==Progression==
{{Into the Abyss}}
