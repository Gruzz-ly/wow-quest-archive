==Objectives==
Activate 3 Shadestar Loci around The [[Ingress]].
*[[Shadestar Locus]] activated (3)

==Description==
The Void here. It is like nothing else. I know you feel it, too. I'm proud that you pulled through.

We must do something to stabilize the area. I'm barely able to keep our escape route from imploding, and the rest of our scouts... I can only hope they can hold it together.

;Every single race
The ren'dorei know what to do. They will place Shadestar Loci to protect this area, but will need your help activating them.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Hazy Penumbral Mitts]]
* [[Gauntlets of Infinite Gravity]]
* [[Neverending Vortex Striders]]
* [[Grips of the Colossal Behemoth]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
;Every single race
The void elves risk corruption, and yet are most suited to understanding the world around us. We need their expertise, but cannot trust them.

It irks me, but I have already sent for more scouts.

All-consuming.
