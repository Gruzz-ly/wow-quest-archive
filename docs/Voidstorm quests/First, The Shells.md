==Objectives==
Collect 5 Empty Manacells from mechs and ethereals at the [[Ethereum Refinery]].
* [[Empty Manacell]] (5)
* Stay Awhile and Listen to Lothraxion (Optional)

==Description==
Ages ago, on a dismal world of swamp, I led the [[Army of the Light]] to a demon-infested manaforge obscured by vines and fog. My soldiers left that world in a haze of flame and smoke, the scent of burning mana and victory in the air. We will do now as we did then.

We'll begin by collecting the empty canisters they use to hold and transport fuel. The [[ethereal]]s, and especially their automatons, will have them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*14,135 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good. The same make I remember. Now, the catalyst.

==Notes==
Make sure you pick up [[Work Disruption]] from [[Alleria Windrunner]].
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|We'll secure the canisters and disrupt their operations. Stay close, [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]].}}
:''[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] runs off and jumps from a cliff."
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I was about to say the same to you.}}
:"Alleria follows suit."

In the quest area, look out for a [[Cracked Holokey]] that starts [[A Cracked Holokey]].

[[Decimus]] has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|I can't remember the last time I was restrained like this. And in such a novel manner!

What do you suppose we call the material now? Lightgraft? It's not unlike your friend's Lightforging, now that I think about it.}}

Lothraxion has a {{gossip|<Stay awhile and Listen.>}} option
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Earn your keep. Tell us more.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|But of course, it is the right of the victor to take from the defeated. On this world, and on every other.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|You stand upon a land ruled by predation. Here, the strong thrive and the weak sustain them.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|The recent arrival of Xal'atath was, for a time, an entertaining shake up. But her vision for your world--for all of our cosmos--is terribly dull.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|She brought you to heel? How like the endless armies of the Void to suffer from disorder.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Too true. I prefer the thrash and struggle. The delights of stark contrast. There is no foe so thrilling as one strong in the Light.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Belief is our strength. You believe in nothing.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|So pious. You're a curious creature, aren't you? A nathrezim, all wreathed in gold? Must be quite the story.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|We embrace a unity you could never understand.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|I became worthy of the Light. Such strength of will is beyond you.}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|So aggressive. This world suits you, Lothraxion.}}

Slay the Ethereals & their mechs and loot the empty manacells.

Meet back with the party after,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|You live up to your legend, mother.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|And you fight well. But don't be in a rush to make your own.}}

Alleria has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|Being with my son again after so long. I'm glad. But I wish it felt...

<Alleria looks away suddenly, wincing. She shakes it off with a sigh.>

There's no time. All of us need to stay focused on the mission.}}

Make sure you turn in three quests.
