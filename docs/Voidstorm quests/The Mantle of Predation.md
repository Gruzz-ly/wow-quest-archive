==Objectives==
Steal the Mantle of Predation.
*Stay a while and listen [[Lothraxion]] (Optional)
*Speak to Alleria when you're ready
*Seals undone (2)
*Mantle of Predation claimed

==Description==
Let's move quickly. We need to steal the Mantle before [[Terminas]] returns and before [[Lothraxion]] does something rash.

I understand this place grates on him, but he should know to trust my instincts. I thought we'd fought together long enough to earn that.

Let's end this. Ready when you are.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|11|70}}
*7,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Are you alright? I must have missed something. Why did [[Decimus]] bother helping us at all? They could have betrayed us at any time. It doesn't make any sense...

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Make ready. It's time we claim the Mantle of Predation.}}

Lothraxion has a {{Gossip|quest=|<Stay Awhile and Listen.>}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Soon we'll have all we need. We should strike down [[Decimus|this wretch]] before their hunger turns on us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Don't you think we have enough enemies ahead of us? I'll take allies where I can get them.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|The Void holds allegiance to none!}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|It corrupts and confounds, makes enemies of friends, twists right into wrong.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|The Light isn't harmless either. I've felt its fury. Seen the sacrifices it can compel us to make.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|I have served the Light for millennia. I understand sacrifice better than you ever could.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Then don't become numb to it! We all fight for the same cause.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Yet only I seem to understand what is at stake.}}

Speak with Alleria,
{{Dialogue|Are you ready? We're close, yet I feel more unease than ever.

{{Gossip|quest=|<Tell Alleria you're ready to claim the Mantle.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Stay together. No one fights alone, no one gets left behind.}}
:''Lothraxion, Alleria Windrunner, Arator, [[Lady Darkglen]], [[Riftblade Maella]], & [[Riftwalker Sideras]]''


Head to the first seal near Decimus and Lothraxion,

:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Can you feel it? The Mantle is close at hand.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Don't look so eager, beast. You've fooled Alleria, but I see through you.}}
:''The two take off''

Break the [[Vault Seal]] and then meet up with Arator & Alleria with the second seal.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|That look in Lothraxion's eyes is the same I saw in [[Turalyon|father's]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I wish Turalyon were here. Lothraxion might listen to him.}}

Berak the second seal and meet back up with the party.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Claim the Mantle, we'll watch your back.}}

Head to [[Terminas' Vault]] and try to open it. And then, Terminas appear trapping the entire party.
:{{Text|Say|Terminas|Away for but a moment and the vermin move in. You were right to alert me, Decimus.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|I warned you! This was always their plot!}}
:{{Text|Say|Decimus|Do keep our magnificent lord entertained, friends. I'd so hate for him to lose interest.}}

The party was then trapped into an arena
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|What did I miss? Why wait until now to betray us?}}
