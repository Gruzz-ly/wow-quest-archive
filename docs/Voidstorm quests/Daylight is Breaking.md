==Objectives==
Report to Lor'themar Theron in the Sanctum of Light in Silvermoon City.

==Description==
[[Turalyon]] is busying himself with the troops. We'll need to let him know what they'll face here, tell him about [[Lothraxion]]...

<Alleria shakes her head.>

Thank you, <name>. Even when my thoughts feel clouded you never seem to waver. Go, give Lor'themar my report. Arator and I will brief Turalyon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|5|85}}
*3,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This was an impossible mission--we won't forget the sacrifices that bought us a fighting chance. Still, I know not every victory feels worthy of celebration. When war forces us to choose between friendship and duty, there are many who would be unable to act.

We will not squander the opportunity you've given us. Now, our counter offensive begins.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Give Lor'themar my report. Tell him... we did what we had to.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]|I'm sure Lothraxion felt the same.}}
:''Alleria Windrunner, Arator, [[Decimus]], & [[Magister Umbric]] departs.''

Return to [[Silvermoon City]] and go to Lor'themar.
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|<name>? Thank the Light. With the storm breaking, we just might win this.}}

Upon completion,
:{{Text|Say|Lor'themar Theron|You made the right choice--the only choice. Now we can truly begin to fight back.}}
