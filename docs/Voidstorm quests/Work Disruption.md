==Objectives==
Slay Shadowguard and disrupt the Manaforge at the [[Ethereum Refinery]].
*Manaforge Disrupted (0/100%)

==Description==
The [[Shadowguard]] may once have defied [[Xal'atath]], but they're part of her army now. Whatever they're doing with the energies gathered here must be stopped.

Put down their soldiers, harvesters, and machines. I'll do the same, and meet you deeper within.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*14,135 [[XP]]

==Completion==
They will try to rebuild. But we won't give them the chance.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|We'll secure the canisters and disrupt their operations. Stay close, [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]].}}
:''Arator runs off and jumps from a cliff."
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I was about to say the same to you.}}
:''Alleria follows suit.''

Make sure you pick up [[First, The Shells]] from [[Lothraxion]]. In the quest area, look out for a [[Cracked Holokey]] that starts [[A Cracked Holokey]].

Fill the bar up by slaying the [[Manaforge Siphoner]]s (3%), [[Recommissioned Mech]]s (4%), [[Manaforge Warder]]s (6%), [[Netherbreaker]]s (5%), [[Manaforge Netherdrifter]]s, [[Manaforge Engineer]]s, [[Forlorn Inventor]]s, [[Manaforge Warder]]s, & [[Conscripted Engineer]]s, & [[Devouring Enforcer]]s, rescuing the [[Unraveling Captive]]s, ripping the Pipes from the [[Unstable Collector]]s (10%) and breaking the [[Vulnerable Piping]] (8%)

Meet back with the party after.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|You live up to your legend, mother.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|And you fight well. But don't be in a rush to make your own.}}

Alleria has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|Being with my son again after so long. I'm glad. But I wish it felt...

<Alleria looks away suddenly, wincing. She shakes it off with a sigh.>

There's no time. All of us need to stay focused on the mission.}}

Make sure you turn in three quests.
