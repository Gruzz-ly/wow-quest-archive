==Objectives==
Free the captured void elves to silence the Overcroft's turrets.
*[[Leona Darkstrider]] freed
*[[Lady Darkglen]] freed
*[[Riftblade Kelain]] freed

==Description==
Their very life force is being siphoned to power the ethereals' guns, <name>! This cannot be allowed to continue.

Head into the [[Ethereum Overcroft]] and free my fellow Void Elves from the ethereals' clutches. With their freedom, the turrets will have no power, and [[Turalyon]] will be able to launch his [[warframe]]s.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Voidbreaker's Flames]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Mantle]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Spaulders]]
*[[Voidbreaker's Shoulderplates]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|46|80}}
*3,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My people thank you. I'm sure Turalyon will be eager to get the assault underway.

==Notes==
Upon accepting both '''Powerless''' & [[Master of Mayhem]]
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|The captured ren'dorei are links in a chain. Break that chain, and our assault can truly begin.}}
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|You're right, Umbric. Freeing your people gives us the opening we need for an assault.}}

Head to the Ethereum Overcroft and free the Void elves

Upon freeing Leona Darkstrider,
:{{Text|Say|Leona Darkstrider|The Void enslaves you, while I am empowered by it!}}

Upon freeing Lady Darkglen,
:{{Text|Say|Lady Darkglen|The Voidspire will fall, ethereals!}}

Upon freeing Riftblade Kelain,
:{{Text|Say|Riftblade Kelain|Here! Take this message back to [[Xal'atath]]!}}

With the 3 Void Elves freed, a [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "The Ramparts are Vulnerable" starts showing,
:''The Turrets started to shut down with the void elves being freed.''

Returtn to Turalyon and Umbric and turn in both quests.
:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|Well done, <name>! You've struck a decisive blow against the Devouring Host. With Umbric's help.}}

Upon completion, An Assault Warframe arrives.

High Exarch Turalyon has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|The Voidspire is formidable. But anything built, can be torn down.

This will be no different.}}
