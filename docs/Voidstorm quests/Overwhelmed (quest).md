==Objectives==
Reconvene with Arator at [[Locus Point]].

==Description==
We were too late. All of the strength between us wasn't enough.

<Arator looks over his shoulder, wary. Then, he crouches and places his hand on [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]]'s shoulder. She responds only with a ragged exhale.>

Let's fall back. The ren'dorei have been exploring the wilds while we've been following [[Lothraxion]]. We might be able to find their encampment nearby.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|5|85}}
*3,575 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Even the power of a naaru wasn't enough...

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|[[Decimus]]|I had no idea Lady Windrunner held a [[L'ura|dark naaru]] of her own. This is more than mere entertainment...}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Ignore it, Arator. See to Alleria. Salvaging this mission now falls to me.}}
:''Lothraxion takes off as Decimus, Arator, & Alleria, who was limping, begin to walk off.''

Head to Locus Point and meet up with the gang.

Decimus has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|Worried I'm plotting my escape? On the contrary. At this rate, you'll never be rid of me.}}

So too does Lothraxion:
{{Dialogue|<Lothraxion stares dead-ahead.>}}

Especially, Arator
{{Dialogue|<name>. We need to check on the others.

{{Gossip|What about you?}}
{{Dialogue-child|You shouldn't need to worry about me.

But [[T'era]]'s pain... I felt it deep. I'm sure you did too.

I knew there were costs to pay in treading this path. But I hadn't felt them like this until now.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
