==Objectives==
Use Umbric's scrying device to observe the current tactical situation.
*Speak to Umbric
*[[Void Scryer|Observing]] begun
*Injured Allies observed
*Stalker Patriarch observed

==Description==
The ethereals on the nearby plateau are forcing us to ground our heavier weapons. We'll need to neutralize their turrets before we can begin our assault on the Voidspire.

Speak to [[Magister Umbric|Umbric]] and he'll help you gain a tactical understanding of the battlefield.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|17|55}}
*3,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Now you see what assails us. Taking out those turrets, and saving the void elves strapped to those machines, are our primary objectives if we want our warframes to take to the skies.

==Notes==

:{{Text|Say|High Exarch Turalyon|We're being hit from all sides! We need a tactical assessment. Umbric! <name> can assist you.}} (The Voice-over says "We're being hit from all sides! We need a tactical assessment. Umbric! The champion can assist you."
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Normal methods of scrying are less effective in the [[Voidstorm]]. I've created this attuned platform that can detect the threats we face.}}

Speak with Umbric:

:''Umbric summons his Void Scryer.''
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|With this device, you'll be able to view the tactical situation in relative safety.}}

Go into the Void Scryer and scry on the allies, and a [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Scrying the Allies who Are Surrounded" plays out:
:''The Telescope spies on the Vanguard Soldiers being taken out by the voidspawns.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Magister Umbric|The Devouring Host has been drawing out Vanguard forces and picking them off.}}
:{{Text|Bossemote|Magister Umbric|They won't last long without rescue.}}

On the other side of the cutscene, Umbric continues.
:{{Text|Say|Magister Umbric|Turalyon has focused on breaking through their lines. Perhaps now he'll respond to these kidnappings?}}

Scry on the Stalker and a [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Scrying the Shredclaw" starts showing:
:''The telescope spies on three Vanguard troops marching and then a [[shredclaw]] appear and snatches one and left the two dead.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Magister Umbric|Look! One of the Vanguard officers has been captured!}}
:''The telescope shifts to a pack of Shredclaws appearing.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Magister Umbric|I've been trying to track these beasts, but their use of void portals makes it nearly impossible.}}

Scry on the allies and a [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Scrying on the Void Elf being Used as a Battery" starts showing:
:''The Telescope spies on [[Leona Darkstrider]] who is being tormented.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Magister Umbric|My own people, captured by the ethereals and their life force siphoned to power these turrets.}}
:''The telescope shifts to the turret.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Magister Umbric|I could scarcely believe it until I saw it with my own eyes.}}
:''The telescope shifts to Leona Darkstrider.''
:{{Text|Bossemote|Magister Umbric|We must rescue them, <name>!}}
