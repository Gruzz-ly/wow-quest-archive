==Objectives==
Watch the scene on the platform.
*Vision beheld.
*Portal taken to [[Voidstorm]]

==Description==
We have what we need.

Prepare yourself to see Illidan's confrontation with the naaru so many years ago.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70}}
* 3,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I've only ever wanted to protect my people. Just like how demon hunters protect Azeroth.

==Notes==
Upon accept, the echoes of [[Xe'ra]] and [[Illidan Stormrage]] appear.
:{{Text|Say|Xe'ra|Illidan, your enemy is far greater than [[Sargeras]] and his [[Burning Legion]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Illidan Stormrage|Wonderful. As if they were not strong enough.}}
:{{Text|Say|Xe'ra|The Void is a more potent foe by far. And confronting it is your destiny.}}
:{{Text|Say|Illidan Stormrage|My destiny is not dictated by you, naaru.}}

The echoes vanish,
:{{Text|Say|Leona Darkstrider|The naaru wanted to recruit Illidan to fight the Void? Fascinating.}}
:{{Text|Say|Allari the Souleater|Let's speak when we return. Digging up secrets of the past has a way of attracting all sorts of attention.}}

Take the gateway to go to the [[Howling Ridge]] as Leona and Allari returned.
:{{Text|Say|Leona Darkstrider|So the naaru approached Illidan and warned him of the Void?}}
:{{Text|Say|Allari the Souleater|They wanted to recruit him to combat what they believed to be Azeroth's greatest threat.}}
:{{Text|Say|Allari the Souleater|But the Illidari are not soldiers following orders. We're predators.}}
:{{Text|Say|Allari the Souleater|Killers.}}

Allari has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|Have you been on this planet long, <name>? These apex void predators are perfect for honing my scythe skills.

{{Gossip|I'm curious, Allari. Did the naaru persist in their attempts to sway Illidan to their cause?}}
{{Dialogue-child|They did, quite adamantly in fact. Would you like to see how it turned out?

{{Gossip|Play Movie=|Show me.}} (This shows the "Rejection of the Gift" which is in [[The Child of Light and Shadow]])
}}
}}

==Trivia==
*Illidan and Xe'ra's conversation was taken directly from the ''[[World of Warcraft: Illidan]]'' novel.
