==Objectives==
Attend the War Council.

==Description==
I know better than to question [[Alleria Windrunner|my wife]] when she's set on a target, but I trust that the target was chosen well.

Our forces have acquitted themselves admirably, readying the battlefield for the main assault. Now listen, as the war council begins.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|70|20}}
*3,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Make ready, <name>. Soon, we will pay Xal'atath back for all she has done to us.

==Notes==
Speak with Turalyon:
{{Dialogue|The Voidspire is formidable. But anything built, can be torn down.

This will be no different.
