==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Severum.jpg|Severum|Severum's intense hunger has helped him claw his way up the food chain.}}
Slay [[Severum]] and claim his sigil.
*[[Severum's Sigil]]

==Description==
[[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]]'s judgement is clouded. She's spent too much time steeped in Void. I've prosecuted campaigns across the cosmos. Casualties are inevitable. I could not command if the loss of every soldier broke my will.

We have the information we need: the location of the sigil bearer. The fiends whisper of a domanaar named Severum. Slay him and take his sigil, then we can be rid of this place.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*14,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Would that we could put every voidspawn to the sword.

==Completion==
Well done, soon we'll have the Mantle of Predation and no longer need [[Decimus]].

Do not mistake their usefulness for allegiance as Alleria has.

==Notes==
Upon accepting [[All Become Prey]] from [[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Vanished in the Void]] from [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]], & '''Hollow Hunger''' from Lothraxion,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Remain here, Lothraxion. You've already put this mission at risk.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|Risk? You trust the word of a domanaar over mine.}}

Head inside the citadel and confront Severum
:{{Text|Say|Severum|More for the feast!}}

Upon slaying Severum,
:{{Text|Say|Severum|Hungry! So... hungry...}}

Take the sigil and Consume Severum's sigil with the ability: {{Abilities|Consume Severum's Sigil|id=1230214|icon=inv_nullstone_void|Devour the symbol of Severum's authority to gain access to the vault.}}

After consuming the sigil, return to the party
:{{Text|Say|Arator|<name>, where's [[Riftwalker Hieron|Hieron]]? Is he...?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|War is no place for a tender heart, boy.}}

[[Lady Darkglen]] has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|<Lady Darkglen glowers at Lothraxion.>

That bastard's lucky Alleria is here. As soon as we're done, he'll answer for what happened to Hieron.}}

So too does [[Riftblade Maella]]
{{Dialogue|<Maella maintains a white-knuckle grip on her blade.>

I won't let this place take any more of my people.}}

Especially [[Riftwalker Sideras]]
{{Dialogue|<Sideras gives you a wry smile, then winces and clutches his side.>

Never thought I'd serve under another Windrunner. Seems to be going about as well as last time.}}
