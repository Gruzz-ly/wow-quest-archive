==Objectives==
Slay [[Nexus-King Salhadaar]]'s lieutenants within [[Nexus Point Mid'ar]].
*[[Darkened Unbound]] slain
*[[Insatiable Watcher]] slain
*[[Nethermade Protector]] slain

==Description==
When that shield goes down, [[Xal'atath]]'s forces will be upon us in droves. If I'm going to detonate those manacells from afar, I'll need an opening. Thin the [[Devouring Host]] of their strongest, and the rest of Xal'atath's lackeys will be easier to fight off.

We will make sure the shield goes down in the meantime. Good luck, Ariana.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Repurposed Volatile Manacell]]
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*14,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I hope Xal'atath was watching. It'll be her turn soon.

==Notes==
Upon accepting [[Third, Blow It Up]] from [[Lothraxion]], [[Just In Case...]] from [[Decimus]], & '''Agents of Darkness''' from Alleria Windrunner,
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|[[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]], keep an eye on your mother and her smug hound. I don't want it out of the Light's presence.}}
:''Decimus & Arator starts departing.''
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Direct your zeal at our foes, Lothraxion. And remember that I'm not one of them.}}
:''Alleria departs and not long after, Lothraxion flies off.''

Jump off the ledge into the Nexus-Point.
:{{Text|Say|Xal'atath|It seems you have visitors, Salhadaar. Remember what we discussed.}}
:{{Text|Yell|Nexus-King Salhadaar|They will not stop me! Not this time! Shadowguard, slay them!}}

Head to the [[Insatiable Watcher]] and start battling it,
:{{Text|Say|Insatiable Watcher|HUNGER. WITHOUT. END.}}

Upon slaying it,
:{{Text|Say|Insatiable Watcher|EAT... OR BE...}}

Head to the [[Darkened Unbound]] and start battling it,
:{{Text|Say|Darkened Unbound|The Void... unmakes us...}}

Upon slaying it,
:{{Text|Say|Darkened Unbound|Was there... no other way...?}}

Head to the [[Nethermade Protector]] and the [[Forlorn Inventor]] and start battling them,
:{{Text|Say|Forlorn Inventor|A Mortal! Your soul shall renew my creation!}}

Upon slaying the Nethermade Protector,
:{{Text|Say|Forlorn Inventor|NO! I'll kill you for that!}}

Upon slaying the Forlorn Inventor,
:{{Text|Say|Forlorn Inventor|Relief... At last...}}

Head to the ethereal installation and meet up with the party
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|This is taking too long. Stand aside, I'll smash the damned thing.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|No, Lothraxion! <name>, we need your eyes.}}

Upon completion,
