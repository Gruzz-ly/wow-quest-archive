==Objectives==
Kill 12 monsters in The Ingress.
*Ingress monsters slain (12)

==Description==
Ha! A distant realm, crawling with vicious evil monsters? Just like old times.

[[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]], [[Turalyon]], and I faced a thousand years of war with demons in the far flung realms. It is as simple a solution now as it was then.

Kill or be killed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*12,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
;Every single race
Vile beasts. Did you sense it?

They all reek of Void.

;{{Race|VoidElf}}
Vile beasts. Did you sense it?

They all reek of Void.

<Lothraxion curls his lip.>

Like you.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|We must get a lay of land. Come!}}

Make sure you accept [[Save a Piece of Mind]] from [[Magister Umbric]].
:''[[Riftwalker Sideras]], [[Lady Darkglen]], [[Riftwalker Hieron]], [[Riftblade Astre]] begin to split up.''
:{{Text|Say|Voidlight Everdawn|We must scout... yes. Yes, scout ahead...}}
:''[[Riftblade Maella]] looks at Everdawn as she departs.''
:{{Text|Say|Riftblade Maella|Everdawn--No! Curses!}}
:''Maella departs the other route.''

Across the Ingress, slay the [[Ravenous Shredclaw]]s, [[Cunning Harrower]]s, [[Hungry Kilivore]]s, [[Territorial Natherwasp]], & [[Cunning Voidscythe]]s.

Meet up with Lothraxion & [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] once the task is done.
:{{Text|Say|Lothraxion|This is what Alleria wanted to protect you from, Arator. The darkness beyond.}}

Arator has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|<Arator winces.>

There is a pressure on my mind, a fear in my heart like I've never known...}}
