==Objectives==
Meet Alleria at her campsite.
*Alleria's Campsite reached
*Alleria Assisted

==Description==
Vicious voidbeasts have been snatching our officers, <name>. I've been told that you saw one from afar, through [[Magister Umbric|Umbric]]'s void scryer. 

Those beasts are steeped in void energy, using their instinctual mastery of teleportation to strike at our most vulnerable before melting back into the shadows. 

Alleria has gone after them, and sent a request for another pair of eyes. You can find her at a campsite at the mouth of the gorge to the east. I'll mark it on your map.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*3,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I hope you're prepared to hunt, <name>. This quarry is more elusive than most.

==Notes==
Upon accept,
:{{Text|Say|Arator|<Name>, a word. I ask that you not mention anything to my mother about [[Past Redemption|what happened]] at the [[Amani Pass]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I've been waiting for [[Turalyon|my father]] to tell her about it himself. But... it looks like I'll have to be the one to do it.}}

Arator has a gossip
{{Dialogue|The Light stands with us, there is hope.}}

Upon arrive Alleria's campsite
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|I assume Arator sent you to help me? I could use another pair of hands.}}

Upon investigating the dead Voidstalker,
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Scraps of a Vanguard uniform... officer emblem... just as I thought.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|They're abducting the Vanguard's officers, <Name>. Is this just the hunger of the beasts, or is Xal'atath gathering intelligence?}}
