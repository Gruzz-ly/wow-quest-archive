You've done it, <name>. Even in these times we must honor our dead.

Take these offerings and place them at Aderic's tomb.

Let's hope that's enough to placate the ghosts of our ancestors.

You will receive: {{cost||4}}

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>?

==Completion==
It's done, <name>. The dead return to their slumber.

==Notes==
Run due north of Krennan's position up the hill. Use the item and a cutscene will take place.  Darius, Lorna and the player are all in attendance as Genn buries his son.
:{{text|say|King Genn Greymane|May the Light bless the spirits of our ancestors, for they've chosen to allow my son to rest upon this holy ground.}}
:{{text|say|King Genn Greymane|It is here, surrounded by the heroes and patriots of Gilneas where he belongs.}}
:{{text|say|Lorna Crowley|You were a true man of the people, Liam. Unlike any Royal I ever met. We'll make them pay for this.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Darius Crowley|Gilneas will remember your courage forever, Liam.}}
:{{text|say|King Genn Greymane|We'll return, Liam. I swear this to you.}}

The player will wind up in front of Krennan after the cutscene completes. Completing the quest will phase out the ghosts. The gate out of [[Aderic's Repose]] will also now be open.
