==Objectives==
Free 5 {{NPC||Enslaved Villager}}s inside the [[Emberstone Mine]].
*Enslaved Gilnean freed x5

==Description==
We recently found out that the villagers at Emberstone survived most of the ravages of the Curse.

Unfortunately their village wasn't as fortunate when it came to the [[Forsaken]] invasion.

The Forsaken have taken the villagers prisoner and are forcing them to work the nearby mine as slaves.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}

==Progress==
Have you freed the villagers, <name>? I cannot imagine what duress they're enduring under the Forsaken.

==Completion==
You've done it again, <name>. The freed villagers are eager to help us against the Forsaken in any way they can.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Last Meal]] and [[Slaves to No One]] before heading out.

Head northeast and in to the cave. Kill [[Forsaken Slavedriver]]s to loot [[Slaver's Key]]s. Use the keys to open the Balls and Chains keeping the Enslaved Villagers at the mine.
*Thank you!
*The Forsaken will pay for what they've done!
*It's true then? Even those afflicted by the Curse are fighting the Forsaken!

==Progression==
{{Battle for Gilneas City}}
