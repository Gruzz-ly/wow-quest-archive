==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Gwen Armstead}} in [[Stormglen]].

==Description==
It'll be a long time before our nation comes together again. The old political divisions pale in comparison to what divides us now.

Yet if there was ever a time for us to come together and unite against a common enemy, it is now. And it is you, <name>, who have proven able to bridge the gap between our people.

Return to Stormglen and tell them it is safe to go through the [[Blackwald]] on the way to [[Tempest's Reach]]. We will take care of any [[Forsaken]] who follow them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||1|50}}

==Completion==
{{NPC||Genn Greymane||King Greymane}} gave me a brief rundown of the plan before he set off for the Blackwald. Doesn't make it sound any less crazy.

==Progression==
