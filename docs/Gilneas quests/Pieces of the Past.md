==Objectives==
Obtain 6 Old Journal Pages.
*[[Old Journal Page]] x6

==Description==
I found a journal by a man named Bradshaw. Unfortunately it's missing many pages. Especially towards the end.

If you find enough of the pages I might be able to piece together what happened here after the Curse broke out.

Who knows... maybe the people in this town found a way out. Maybe there are still survivors out there.

Maybe {{NPC||Darius Crowley||my father}} is still alive.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||2|25}}

==Progress==
Any luck finding those pages?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. It will take some time, but I'll try to make sense of what we have.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Pest Control (worgen)]] before heading out.

There are papers strewn everywhere east of the first few buildings of Stormglen.

==Progression==
