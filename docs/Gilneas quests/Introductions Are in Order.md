==Objectives==
Kill 4 Ogre Minions and obtain Koroth's Banner in [[Koroth's Den]].
*[[Ogre Minion]] slain x4
*[[Koroth's Banner]]

==Description==
The [[Forsaken]] are right on our heels and now these [[ogre]]s are trying to flank us, <name>.

They're servants of the [[ettin]] {{NPC||Koroth the Hillbreaker||Koroth}} -- the meanest, most destructive force in all of [[Gilneas peninsula|Gilneas]].

If we can bait Koroth into charging the Forsaken's forward force, we should be able to cover our retreat and buy some time.

The only way this can work is if we make Koroth furious. It won't be enough to just kill his minions. We need to swipe his most prized possession, a tiger-skinned banner.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||2|25}}

==Progress==
How did it go, <name>?

==Completion==
You definitely got the ettin angry, <name>. I heard him myself.

Let's hope this works.

== Notes ==
Head up the hill behind the carriage and kill ogres along the way. The Hillbreaker is up near the top, behind his banner. Snag the banner at {{co|46.8|83.2|Gilneas||2|link=Gilneas (starting zone)}} and run!

On looting the banner:
:{{text|yell|Koroth the Hillbreaker|Who dares to touch Koroth's banner!?}}
:{{text|yell|Koroth the Hillbreaker|You puny thief! Koroth find you! Koroth smash your face in!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Prince Liam Greymane|Just in time, <name>. Here come the Forsaken.}}
:''Liam runs forward and plants the banner.''
:{{text|yell|Prince Liam Greymane|You will come no further, Forsaken scum! By the war banner of the ancient Greymane clan, I expel you from our ancestral lands!}}
:''A squad of Forsaken come down the path and take the banner.''
:{{text|yell|Captain Asther|Worthless mongrel. I will order our outhouses cleaned with this rag you call a banner.}}
:''Koroth appears and attacks the Forsaken!''
:{{text|yell|Koroth the Hillbreaker|Corpse-men take Koroth's banner! Corpse-men get smashed to bitses!!!}}
