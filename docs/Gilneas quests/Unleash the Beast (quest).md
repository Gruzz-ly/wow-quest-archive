==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Forsaken Footsoldier]]s or [[Forsaken Sailor|Sailors]]
*Forsaken Combatant slain x8

==Description==
I'm not going to lie, <name>. I don't like the idea of having [[worgen]] among our ranks.

Who knows how long til {{NPC||Krennan Aranas||Krennan's}} concoction wears off and you're trying to chomp one of our heads off.

Until that time, however, we can make ample use of your ferocity.

I want you to go out in the battlefield and kill as many of those [[Forsaken]] as you can, in as brutal a way as you can.

We're going to put the fear of the worgen in them, <name>.

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Gilded Leggings|Godfrey's Dagger}}
You will also receive: {{cost||1|25}}

==Progress==
Did you take care of the Forsaken scum, <name>?

==Completion==
Not bad, <name>. it's a good thing you're on our side.

== Notes ==
Don't worry about killing footsoldiers. There are plenty of sailors between players and the captains below deck their respective ships.

==Progression==
