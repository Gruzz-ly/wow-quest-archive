This quest is a part of the Gilneas starting experience and is only provided for starting [[worgen]] players. This quest is only offered once the three quest branches ([[Grandma Wahl (quest)]], [[The Crowley Orchard]], and [[The Hayward Brothers]]) have been completed.

==Objectives==
Return to {{NPC||Gwen Armstead}} in [[Duskhaven]].

==Description==
Thanks for your help, <name>. This ship is ready to sail.

Now you go and tell Miss Armstead that we're not going to be part of the land evacuation.

We Haywards have been men of the sea for generations. If we're to leave our home, then we'll do it by sea.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||85}}

==Completion==
It's just as well, <name>. Maybe the Haywards will fare better than us.

== Notes ==
Sebastian only offers this quest if players completed his quests last. Otherwise, Lorna will offer [[Horses for Duskhaven]] or Gramma will offer [[Ready to Go]].

==Progression==
{{Exodus from Duskhaven}}
