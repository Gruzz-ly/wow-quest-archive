Retrieve Chance the cat.
*[[Chance the Cat]] {{co|35.2|74.8|Gilneas||1|link=Gilneas (starting zone)}}

==Description==
Right! About the evacuation, dear.

I just cannot leave without my cat. He's an adorable orange tabby.

Chance's favorite spot to play is a broken down cart near an arbor northeast of here.

Bring him here and we'll be on our way.

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Granny's Mallet|Orange Blanket}}
You will also receive: {{cost||1|25}}

==Progress==
You're such a charming young <man/lady>, <name>.

==Completion==
There he is! Grandma's special boy!

Thank you so much for finding him. I hope it wasn't too much trouble.

My... what manner of dirt found its way underneath my fingernails!

== Notes ==
Head northeast. Chance is sitting on a rock. Right-click it to spawn [[Lucius the Cruel]] who remarks on what great bait the cat is. During the fight, Grandma Wahl comes out to assist! Loot Lucius to pick up the cat.

On interacting with the cat:
:{{text|say|Lucius the Cruel|I'll be taking this cat. It seems to work as the perfect bait. Prepare to die now, fool!}}
:{{text|yell|Grandma Wahl|You do not mess with my kitty you son of a mongrel!}}
:''Wahl transforms into her worgen form!''
