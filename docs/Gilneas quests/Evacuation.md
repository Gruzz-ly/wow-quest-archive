==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Gwen Armstead}} in [[Duskhaven]].

==Description==
We've escaped through dumb luck, <name>. But luck is running out.

The coast is becoming flooded even as we speak. And from the look of it, the landmass beneath us hasn't quite settled yet.

I hate to say this, but we have to leave. Curses, <name>.... I cannot lose my homeland twice in one lifetime. Yet these earthquakes are not an enemy we can defeat.

Tell Gwen Armstead to start the evacuation.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||45}}

==Completion==
{{NPC||Liam Greymane||Liam}} is right. We must get everyone to higher ground.

You must help me spread the word while I manage the logistics of the evacuation.

==Progression==
{{Exodus from Duskhaven}}
