==Objectives==
{{NPC||Sebastian Hayward}} at the [[Hayward Fishery]] wants you to obtain Planks of Wood, Coal Tar and Shipwright's Tools.
*[[Planks of Wood]] {{co|36.1|86.5|Gilneas||1|link=Gilneas (starting zone)}}
*[[Coal Tar]] {{co|37.6|86.0|Gilneas||1|link=Gilneas (starting zone)}}
*[[Shipwright's Tools]] {{co|37.5|87.2|Gilneas||1|link=Gilneas (starting zone)}}

==Description==
Evacuation, you say? Well, we had that very same idea all on our own after these [[Forsaken]] started showing up.

We were thinking the water would be the safest way out of here.

Unfortunately our boats didn't come out from that last earthquake unscathed.

I need some additional supplies to finish my repairs: wood, tar and my tools. Get them for me so that my brothers and I can make it out of here.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||1|25}} and [[Shipwright's Bag]]

==Progress==
Do you have my supplies, <name>?

==Completion==
This is great, <name>. I should be able to finish the repairs in no time.

==Notes==
The tar is north of the house between the two sheds, the tools are inside the house in the back, and the planks of wood are west of the house under the southern shed.

==Progression==
{{Exodus from Duskhaven}}
