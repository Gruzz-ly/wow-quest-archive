==Objectives==
Use the [[Black Gunpowder Keg]]s to blow up 4 [[Horrid Abomination]]s.
*Gunpowder thrown at abomination x4

==Description==
Look here, <name>. The big fat ones -- [[abomination]]s, they're called—they don't go down easy, so don't tackle them on your own.

But I have an idea so crazy it might just work. Or it might get you killed, if we're not careful, I suppose.

There's barrels of gunpowder beneath the sheds and by the windmills. Grab them and toss 'em right on the abominations' heads. I'll take care of the rest with this trusty old blunderbuss.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Refreshing Spring Water|Spice Bread|q1=5|q2=5}}
You will also receive: {{cost||1}} and [[Bottle of Dalaran Noir]] x5

==Progress==
They just keep coming, don't they?

==Completion==
You and me, <name>. We make a great team...

It's good to have you back.

==Notes==
The abominations ''cannot be killed''. If they take too much damage, they will go immune and heal. Instead, there are barrels on the ground in the area. Have an abomination targeted, then interact with a barrel to toss it at the abomination. Liam will take care of the abomination from there.
