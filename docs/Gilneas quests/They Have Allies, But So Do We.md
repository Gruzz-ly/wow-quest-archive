==Objectives==
Use the Night Elven Glaivethrower to slay 40 Orc raiders, 8 Wolfmaw Outriders, and 4 Orcish War Machines.
*[[Orc Raider]] slain x40
*[[Wolfmaw Outrider]] slain x8
*[[Orcish War Machine]] slain x4

==Description==
The [[night elf|night elves]] have made good on their promise. They've brought ships and are ready to offer us sanctuary in their lands.

Unfortunately, the [[Forsaken|Forsaken's]] allies have arrived as well.

The [[orc]]s are advancing on us while the [[Horde]] gunship prevents the transport ships from taking our people to safety.

The [[druid]]s are holding the enemy back, but won't last long. Fortunately, the elven ships were carrying [[siege weapon]]s. Take one of the [[glaive thrower]]s and meet the enemy head on.

== Rewards ==

==Progress==
You're back!

==Completion==
It's almost over, <name>. Only one obstacle remains between us and survival.

== Notes ==
Hop in one of the [[Glaive Thrower (Gilneas)|glaive throwers]] and start mowing orcs down. The glaive throwers have three abilities:
*{{abilities|Launch Glaive|Fires a large glaive towards the area, dealing physical damage to enemies and causing them to be knocked back.|cd=0.25 sec|range=50,000|notes=Instant}}
