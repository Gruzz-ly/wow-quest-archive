==Objectives==
Board a carriage below [[Greymane Manor]].

==Description==
We have no choice, <name>. We must move further inland.

I don't like it one bit, but we're vulnerable here.

Return to the stables below the manor. Let's get everybody on carriages and send them eastbound. I pray it's not too late.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||2|25}}

==Completion==
Thanks for stopping, <name>. Our carriage got hit pretty bad.

The one in front of us got it worse.

== Notes ==
Head back down to the front of the manor and hop on a carriage. It will trek out of the [[Duskhaven]] toward [[Stormglen Village]], but stops upon reaching the [[Stagecoach Crash Site]], where {{NPC||Liam Greymane}} awaits.

==Progression==
{{Exodus from Duskhaven}}
