==Objectives==
Blow the Horn of Tal'doren at the [[Woods' End Cabin]] and retrieve the Mysterious Artifact inside.
*[[Mysterious Artifact]] {{co|57.5|75.6|Gilneas||2|link=Gilneas (starting zone)}}
*[[Horn of Tal'doren]] (provided)

==Description==
Ever since the [[Forsaken]] invaded [[Gilneas peninsula|Gilneas]], we've tried to keep the location of the [[:Scythe of Elune]] secret. We moved it at night to one of many safe locations. The [[Dark ranger|Dark Rangers]] got close, but never found it... until now.

They were last spotted at the Woods' End Cabin, west of here. Blow this horn when you find them and {{NPC||Tobias Mistmantle||Tobias}} and his trackers will engage the Dark Rangers.

Only then will it be safe for you to venture inside the cabin and take back the scythe. Hurry, <name>. It must not reach {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Sylvanas}}.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||2}}

==Progress==
Do you have the scythe, <name>?

==Completion==
I knew we could count on you. You've done well, <name>.

==Notes==
Head out, due west. The cabin is swarmed by veteran dark rangers. Before aggroing any of them, use the horn to summon Tobias and a horde of Tal'doren Trackers. Let the worgen aggro the dark rangers. Sneak in to the cabin and open the worn coffer to recover the Mysterious Artifact. Tobias will only let the trackers keep the rangers occupied for roughly thirty seconds, so move quickly! Once the thirty seconds is up, all of the trackers will warstomp, stunning the dark rangers for a few seconds, buying some last moments for the player to high-tail it out of the cabin.

Using the horn
:{{text|yell|Tobias Mistmantle|Keep them occupied, my brothers! Allow <name> to retrieve the scythe!}}

30 seconds later:
:{{text|yell|Tobias Mistmantle|Fall back! Retreat into the woods!}}
