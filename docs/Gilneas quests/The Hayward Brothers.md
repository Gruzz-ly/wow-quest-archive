Speak to {{NPC||Sebastian Hayward}} at the [[Hayward Fishery]].

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||85}}

==Completion==
You here to give us a hand?

== Notes ==
Head south out of town, past the orchard and the Wahl house. The Hayward brothers (all five of them) are being attacked by [[Forsaken Castaway]]s.

==Progression==
