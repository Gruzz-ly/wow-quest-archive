==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Krennan Aranas}} in [[Duskhaven]].

==Description==
So Krennan's potion did not kill you? Well, I suppose that means the human inside of you is in control then.

I guess I won't be shooting you after all. At least not yet.

Go speak to Krennan Aranas and give him the good news.  He's in charge of the house where we keep... your kind.

Just remember, <name>.. I've got my eye on you. You so much as try anything funny and you'll get a bullet between the eyes.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||50}}

==Completion==
It worked! By the [[Light]], it worked!

== Notes ==
On completion:
:{{text|say|Gwen Armstead|Welcome back, <name>. You were fortunate. Krennan's treatment doesn't always work this well on [[Mindless state|people who've had the Curse as long as you]].}}
:{{text|say|Krennan Aranas|Do exercise caution. Don't expect anyone to invite you to their homes just yet. But at least they won't shoot you outright.}}
