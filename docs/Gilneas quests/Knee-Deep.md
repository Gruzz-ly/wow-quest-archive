==Objectives==
Use the Half-Burnt Torch to get to the other side of the [[Undertaker's Pass|tunnel]] beneath [[Gilneas City]].
*[[Half-Burnt Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
It's time to pack it in, <name>. Most of our people have made it through—it's your turn now.

Take this torch, you're going to need it. The tunnel is full of nasty, knee-biting critters of the worst kind. Use it to keep them at bay.

Speak to [[Krennan Aranas|Krennan]] on the other side.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||4}}

==Completion==
You're here, <name>. Most everyone made it through, but now we're stuck here... surrounded by our own... dead!

==Notes==
Hop down the tunnel. The tunnel is full of [[Graveyard Rat]]s.  Pet classes should put their pets on passive or dismiss them. Put the half-burnt torch on an action bar and start swinging. It works best to swing before any rats get too close to keep damage taken to a minimum. Don't stop running!
