==Objectives==
Speak to [[Lord Hewell]] to obtain [[Stout Mountain Horse|a ride]] to the [[Livery Outpost]] and report to [[Lorna Crowley]].

==Description==
I thank you, <name>. We can't rest on our laurels, however.

We found out about a mining town, currently under [[Forsaken]] occupation. We sent some of my men, along with [[Darius Crowley|Crowley's]] daughter to the nearby livery stables to begin operations there. Liam should be joining them shortly.

I'll stay here and organize the final push for [[Gilneas City]]. Speak to [[Lord Hewell]] to secure a horse to get you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}}

==Completion==
I am glad to have you here, <name>. We're surrounded by Forsaken on all sides and can use all the help we can get.

==Notes==
Talk to Hewell, otherwise it's going to be a ''very'' long run around the east side of [[Gilneas City]] to the east entrance.

==Progression==
{{Battle for Gilneas City}}
