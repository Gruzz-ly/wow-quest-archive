==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Darius Crowley}} at [[Tal'doren]], in the heart of the [[Blackwald]].

==Description==
There are others like you, <name>. And they too, were lost and confused.

There is a place where you belong.

Tal'doren, the wild home, was once home to an order of [[druid]]s who took the shape of wolves.

It is there that you will find the answers you seek. It is also there that you will find someone who can offer guidance. An old friend.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3}}

==Completion==
You're all right, <name>! I've been waiting for this day for a long time, it truly is great to see you friend.

I've heard of what you've done and I'm thankful... especially for {{NPC||Lorna Crowley||Lorna}} -- she's all I have left. I will send for her right away.

== Notes ==
Circle around again heading back toward [[Rygna's Lair]], but keep following the path northeast. Tal'doren is a big tree with blue light popping out everywhere. Inside is Darius Crowley! There are also three other night elves and a number of feral worgen.
