==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Genn Greymane||King Genn Greymane}} in the observatory inside [[Greymane Manor]].

==Description==
You ought to speak to Genn. He's been locked up in his observatory ever since this ordeal started.

I'm sure he's working on a plan for his people. He's a very stubborn individual.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||45}}

==Completion==
There you are, <name>. I've been expecting you.

I got word of your recovery and... wait — do you feel that?

== Notes ==
Run up the stairs behind the queen to the northwest, then keep heading that general directon to head to the observatory behind the manor proper.

==Progression==
