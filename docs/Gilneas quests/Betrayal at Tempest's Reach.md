[[Worgen]] characters earn the iconic [[Lord Walden's Top Hat]] from this quest.

==Objectives==
Drink [[Krennan Aranas|Krennan's]] Potion of Stealth in [[Tempest's Reach]] and assassinate Baron Ashbury and Lord Walden.
*[[Baron Ashbury]] slain
*[[Lord Walden]] slain
*[[Krennan's Potion of Stealth]] (provided)

==Description==
{{NPC||Genn Greymane||King Greymane}} has been taken prisoner by {{NPC||Lord Godfrey}} in Tempest's Reach!

He managed to convince two of the eastern lords to go with his plan. The fool seems to think he can strike a deal with the [[Forsaken]] by turning Greymane over to them.

Listen carefully, <name>. We need to resolve this with as little bloodshed as possible.

This potion will allow you to sneak in undetected. We need you to assassinate the traitorous lords before this gets out of hand!

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Blue-Bloodied Boots|Greymane Cloak|Blue-Bloodied Treads}}
{{Itembox|You will also receive: {{cost||7}}|Lord Walden's Top Hat}}

==Progress==
Careful, <name>.

==Completion==
I wish it could've been avoided, <name>. Let us ensure this is resolved without further bloodshed.

==Notes==
Get close to the reach and use the item. Ignore Genn, as the two named mobs are past him. Lord Walden is north of Genn's position at the house marked on the map, while Baron Ashbury is at the light tower far to the east. Watch out for the mountain mastiffs &mdash; they have Truesight and will see through stealth. Attack the named lords when they are far from any watchmen, as they hit hard. Stay in stealth while moving around to avoid any unnecessary combat and head back to Genn.

On complete:
:{{text|say|King Genn Greymane|It's over Godfrey. You have no support left among the eastern lords.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Godfrey|No... I'd sooner die than have one of [[worgen|your kind]] for a king!}}
:''Lord Godfrey runs to the west and jumps off the cliff, committing suicide!''
