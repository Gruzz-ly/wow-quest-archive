==Objectives==
Obtain 10 Sides of Stag Meat.
*[[Side of Stag Meat]] x10

==Description==
I'm not dumb, <name>. I know what's ahead of us.

Our people are going to go through [[Gilneas City|those gates]] and fight against an enemy that is better trained, has more numbers and better weapons than us.

Even if we succeed, it'll be at great cost. For most of us, today's meal will be the last.

I cannot fight, but I sure can cook. Bring me meat from the stags that roam this area and I will ensure that the last meal these folks get will be their best.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}

==Progress==
Did you get what I needed, <name>?

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>. Our men and women will have a last good meal before they set off for battle.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Liberation Day]] and [[Slaves to No One]] before heading out.

Plenty of {{NPC||Brown Stag}}s are south of the [[Livery Outpost]]. They drop up to three sides at a time.

==Progression==
{{Battle for Gilneas City}}
