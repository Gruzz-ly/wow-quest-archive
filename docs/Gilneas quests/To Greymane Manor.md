==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Mia Greymane||Queen Mia Greymane}} inside [[Greymane Manor]].

==Description==
It's time for everyone to head to safety. That includes you, <name>. Head to Greymane Manor, the others will be there shortly.

Don't worry about me. I'll make sure that everyone makes it out of here in one piece. Yes, even the few ferals we have in the pens.

Once you get there, speak to Queen Greymane about the gravity of the situation.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||45}}

==Completion==
<Name>.  I've heard much about you.

I understand you were crucial in my family's survival during the outbreak in [[Gilneas City]].

== Notes ==
Accepting the quest will put the player on a mount that takes the trip up to the manor. This is a one-way trip! Be sure to learn [[Cooking]] from [[Fielding Chesterhill]] (along with bandages from [[Amelia Atherton]] if you are a Tailor) before accepting this quest, you will ''not'' get another chance until the end of Gilneas storyline.

Completing the quest automatically makes Greymane Manor the player's home.
