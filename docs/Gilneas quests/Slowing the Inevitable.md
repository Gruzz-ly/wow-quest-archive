==Objectives==
Use the {{NPC||Captured Riding Bat}} to destroy 6 Forsaken Catapults and 40 Invading Forsaken.
*Forsaken Catapult slain x6
*Invading Forsaken x40

==Description==
As much as I want to exact swift and brutal revenge... I must honor my son's memory first. He cared for his people first and foremost.

The [[Undertaker's Pass]] goes underground below [[Northgate River]]. You must prevent the plague from being deployed while we evacuate our men, women and children to [[Aderic's Repose]].

We captured one of the [[Forsaken]]'s dreaded bombing bats. I want you to fly the infernal beast as best you can and unleash hell upon those who seek to bring the Plague to our people. Hurry!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||8}}

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>?

==Completion==
You've done well, <name>. Almost everybody managed to make it through.

== Notes ==
Head back outside and hop on the bat. #1 drops Iron Bombs capable of one-shotting the invaders and the catapults alike... #5 will abort the run and fly back to the city once the objective is complete. The bat will loop until players hit #5.

==Progression==
{{Battle for Gilneas City}}
