==Objectives==
Slay Rygna at [[Rygna's Lair]].
*[[Rygna]] slain {{co|68|82|Gilneas||2|link=Gilneas (starting zone)}}

==Description==
The spiders keep coming in alarming numbers, <name>. You're going to have to go into their lair and kill the broodmother.

We've spotted the giant spider known as Rygna at the edge of the [[Blackwald]] in an area covered in thick webs. It'll be dangerous, but we're all counting on you.

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Rygna-Silk Leggings|Arachnophobe's Breastplate|Braided Gossamer Armbands|Arachnophobe's Chain Shirt}}
You will also receive: {{cost||3}}

==Progress==
Did you take care of Rygna, <name>?

==Completion==
Great job, <name>. We've heard rumors of survivors further in the mountains. Now we'll be able to send scouts there.

== Notes ==
Head north out of town and follow the path as it turns eastward. After the first path branches off to the right, keep an eye off to the right for a bunch of spider webs.

Lorna offers the followup.
