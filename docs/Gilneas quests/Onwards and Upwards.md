==Objectives==
Find {{NPC||Krennan Aranas}} on the road to [[Tempest's Reach]].

==Description==
I will do as {{NPC||Darius Crowley||Darius}} asked and have our people move through the [[Blackwald]].

You ought to catch up with {{NPC||Genn Greymane||King Greymane}}. He and Krennan went into Tempest's Reach after {{NPC||Lord Godfrey}} confirmed survivors had made their dwelling there.

Follow the road out of [[Stormglen]] and into the mountains. I asked Krennan to wait for you at the bridge before Tempest's Reach.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||2}}

==Completion==
<Name>!

Genn... they've taken Genn... they've taken... our king!

== Notes ==
Just follow the path east, not up through the Blackwald.

Be sure to learn [[Fishing]] from [[Whilsey Bottomtooth]] before leaving for [[Tempest's Reach]], as there will be no opportunity to do so afterwards.

==Progression==
{{Stormglen}}
