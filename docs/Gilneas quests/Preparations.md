==Objectives==
Bring 6 Moonleafs to {{NPC||Vassandra Stormclaw||Vassandra}}.
*[[Moonleaf]] x6

==Description==
What you know as [[Worgen curse|the Curse]] began as a [[Heretic|heresy]] among our brethren.

Faced with a [[War of the Satyr|losing battle]] against [[Lords of the Emerald Flame|demonic forces]], the [[Druids of the Pack]] eschewed the balance they were sworn to and allowed the beast to overtake them.

They were banished to the [[Emerald Dream]] where they live in eternal slumber under a tree identical to this one, but not before their curse spread to others.

Today our ceremony will restore balance to your people. Bring me the leaf that grows only in [[Tal'doren]]'s vicinity.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3}}

==Progress==
You've returned, <name>.

==Completion==
These simple leaves grow by [[Elune|Elune's]] grace. They will help your mind understand the need for balance and your soul will permanently earn mastery over the beast.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[At Our Doorstep]] before heading out.

Plenty of moonleaf on the ground near small trees in the [[Blackwald]].

==Progression==
