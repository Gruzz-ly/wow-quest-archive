Use the Mastiff Whistle to help you slay Dark Ranger Thyala.
*[[Dark Ranger Thyala]] slain {{co|23.5|67.5|Gilneas|link=Gilneas (starting zone)}}
*[[Mastiff Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
Excellent work so far, <name>. Our scouts have identified the leader of the [[Forsaken]] ground assault.

One of [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]' handpicked [[dark ranger]]s is overseeing the battlefront from the Walden house near the shore. Take this whistle and use it when you're close to her.

I'll have my men let loose our attack [[mastiff]]s to take her down. Be careful, <name>. You don't want to engage her alone.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Leader's Boots
|Dark Ranger's Vest
|Dark Ranger's Hauberk

You also will receive: {{cost||1}}

==Progress==
Is it done yet, <name>?

==Completion==
You did it, <name>. That should take the wind out of their sails.

==Notes==
Exit the cellar and follow the road south. Thyala is a level 7 elite dark ranger with 685 health astride a warhorse. Use the mastiff whistle to kill her.
