==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Darius Crowley||Lord Darius Crowley}} at [[Keel Harbor]] in [[Gilneas (starting zone)|Gilneas]].

==Description==
We might've lost [[Gilneas City|our city]], but at least it looks like the dead have forgiven us.

Meet with the rest of the survivors in Keel Harbor.

I'm sure there's plenty to do before we're in the clear. {{NPC||Genn Greymane||Genn}} hasn't arrived yet, so I suppose Lord Crowley will be in charge there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||50}}

==Completion==
It's good to see you again, <name>.

== Notes ==
Follow the path of the now-open gate out to Keel Harbor.

==Progression==
{{Battle for Gilneas City}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
