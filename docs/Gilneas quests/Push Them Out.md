==Objectives==
Slay 4 Forsaken Infantry, Executor Cornell and Valnov the Mad in [[Emberstone Village]].
*[[Forsaken Infantry]] slain x4
*[[Executor Cornell]] slain
*[[Valnov the Mad]] slain

==Description==
The people are free, but the town is still occupied by the [[Forsaken]]. They're cut off from their main force, so if we're to drive them out, now's our chance.

Their leader, Executor Cornell, is known for his unbound ruthlessness. Also among them is Valnov the Mad, a so-called scientist who carries out inhuman experiments on the villagers too old to work the mines.

Take care of them all.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||4}}

==Progress==
You're back, <name>.

==Completion==
We have the people of Emberstone on our side now thanks to you.

== Notes ==
Head northeast and kill everything. The executor is under the purple forsaken tent and the mad scientist is under the stables.

Completing the quest advances the phase: There's a large squad of militia under Liam at the gate to the city.
