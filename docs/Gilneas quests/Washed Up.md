==Objectives==
{{NPC||Sebastian Hayward}} wants you to kill 6 Forsaken Castaways.
*[[Forsaken Castaway]] slain x6

==Description==
Those [[Forsaken]] ships sank way too close to our [[Hayward Fishery|Fishery]]. All the survivors are making their way here and, as you can see, we're a bit outnumbered.

Help us hold them back while I finish making repairs to the boats.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Boatwork Boots
|Repair Belt
|Repairman's Cinch
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||1|25}}
*480 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]

==Progress==
Bloody Forsaken! Not even the ocean wants them.

==Completion==
Excellent! I'm almost done here.

== Notes ==
Don't worry about the Forsaken attacking the brothers... There's plenty guarding the items needed for [[Not Quite Shipshape]].

==Progression==
{{Exodus from Duskhaven}}
