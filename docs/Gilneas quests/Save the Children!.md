==Description==
The military will not allow me outside the cellar, but my children are still in my farm! Please, you must go find them.

The [[Forsaken]] have no regard for innocent life—my kids are in great danger!

Their names are Cynthia, Ashley and James. If you find them, bring them back here. I'll be forever in your debt.

James is just outside the house to the south.
:{{text|say|<player>|Your mother's in the basement next door. Get to her now!}}
:{{text|say|James|Don't hurt me! I was just looking for my sisters! I think Ashley's inside that house!}}
Ashley is indeed upstairs of the house James is outside of.
:{{text|say|<player>|Join the others inside the basement next door. Hurry!}}
:{{text|say|Ashley|Are you one of the good worgen, <mister/miss>? Did you see Cynthia hiding in the sheds outside?}}
Cynthia is to the southeast at the far end of the field by a shed.
:{{text|say|<player>|It's not safe here. Go to the Allens' basement.}}
