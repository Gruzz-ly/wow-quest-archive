==Objectives==
Use Belysra's Talisman to defeat the Dark Scout.
*[[Dark Scout]] slain
*[[Belysra's Talisman]] (provided)

==Description==
You must have many questions, <name>. And they will be answered in time.

I know why you're here and what you're looking for.

I can't lead you there with the enemy tracking you.

One of {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Sylvanas's}} scouts has been following your tracks. You can't lead the [[Forsaken]] to the place you seek. Take this talisman and walk along the road just north of here.

Let the ranger lure you to her trap and use the power of the talisman to break free and counterattack.

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Seryl's Robes|Hightailing Leggings|Hotfoot Boots|Hightailing Greaves}}
You will also receive: {{cost||4}}

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. The scout never had a chance.

== Notes ==
Circle around to the north back toward [[Rygna's Lair]]. In the middle of the path is an obvious [[Freezing Trap]] at {{co|63.8|81.3|Gilneas||2|link=Gilneas (starting zone)}}. Since there's no way around not getting "trapped", walk right in to it.

On getting frozen:
:{{text|say|Dark Scout|Such easy prey. Sylvanas will be most pleased!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Use Seryl's Talisman to escape before the Dark Scout shoots you!}}
:''The Dark Ranger winds up an aimed shot capable of doing 900 damage, which is more than enough to one-shot players at this level. Escape!''
:{{text|say|Dark Scout|How did you--?! It doesn't matter -- I don't need a trap to defeat you.}}
