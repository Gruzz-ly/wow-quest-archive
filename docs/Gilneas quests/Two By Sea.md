==Description==
The [[Forsaken]] catapults are kicking the snot out of us, <name>. And even if we do take care of them, they've two ships with rows of cannons at the ready.

I've a plan to kill two birds with one stone. You're the stone in this plan.

Take out the machinists manning the catapults. After this, use the catapults to launch yourself aboard the Forsaken ships.

If your aim isn't terrible, you should be able to land safely. Once onboard, go below decks and take care of each ship's captain. Good luck, <class>.

You're back, <name>. How's the situation outside?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. You might be a bloody beast, but you're our beast.

== Notes ==
Target and kill the machinists piloting the catapults. Hop in the catapult and aim for the deck of the ship. Make sure to aim a few feet in, as aiming for the edge of the deck will drop the player in the ocean. The captains are astern below deck.
