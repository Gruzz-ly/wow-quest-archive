==Objectives==
Find the [[Crate of Mandrake Essence]].

==Description==
Ah, yes. The effects of the [[Worgen curse|Curse]] cannot ever be fully cured as far as we know.

With treatment, however, your mind will remain yours... and not that of a wild animal.

We are fortunate that the treatment worked on you. Normally, I can only treat recent infections.

We'll need to continue your medication if we're to have you reverse the Curse.

I will need mandrake essence to brew another batch of my serum for you. You will find a crate stashed beneath a shed southwest of town.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||1}}

==Completion==
The crate has been smashed and the vials inside of it appear to have been broken.

==Notes==
Immediately southwest of town. Not down by the water. There's a {{NPC||Slain Watchman}} near the crate. Completing the quest shows a cutscene pointing down to the ships assaulting the beach. Interact with the Slain Watchman to continue.

==Progression==
{{Duskhaven}}

==Patch changes==
