==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Prince Liam Greymane}} outside of [[Duskhaven]].

==Description==
The reefs have always protected us from a coastal attack. The [[Cataclysm (event)|earthquakes]] must've opened a passage for the [[Forsaken]] ships.

Quick, <name>. Slow down the attackers while I get the rest of the militia ready.

I think I can hear the Prince and some of our men engaging the Forsaken even as we speak. Speak to Liam and see how you can be of use.

Oh... and make sure he doesn't get himself killed. I'm afraid he might be a little reckless in his current state.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||50}}

==Completion==
<Name>!!! You ARE alive!

I thought I was having dreams about the old days when I heard your voice...

== Notes ==
The onslaught has started and invaders are attacking from the south.

==Progression==
{{Duskhaven}}
