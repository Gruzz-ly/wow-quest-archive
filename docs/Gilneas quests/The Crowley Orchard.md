==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Lorna Crowley}} at the [[Crowley Orchard]].

==Description==
Of course you remember {{NPC||Darius Crowley||Lord Darius Crowley's}} daughter, Lorna.

She never quite recovered after losing her father in [[Gilneas City]]. She's basically led the life of a hermit. The only visitor she's allowed into her house has been {{NPC||Krennan Aranas||Krennan}}... and he won't say a word about the whole thing.

Send word to her about the evacuation.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||17}}

==Completion==
Stay back! Don't make me...

Is it you? By the [[Light]]! It's you, <name>!

==Notes==
For Worgen hunters - this will be your first "on the way" opportunity to tame a pet (one of the [[Fox (mob)|foxes]] in the orchard).

==Progression==
{{Exodus from Duskhaven}}
