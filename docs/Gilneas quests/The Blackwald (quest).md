==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Bradshaw Mill|Bradshaw mill]] just outside of [[Stormglen Village]].

==Description==
It took a while, but I think I've put together what happened here. At least partially.

There were survivors of the Curse in this town. They've joined others in the mountains, in [[Tempest's Reach]].

Everyone left, except the man who kept the journal, old man Bradshaw. He noticed that the [[worgen]] attacks stopped all of a sudden and decided to venture into the [[Blackwald]].

There is an abandoned mill just northeast of town, it was where Bradshaw lived. See if you can find any clues there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||1|10}}

==Completion==
I've been expecting you, <name>. Do not be alarmed.

My name is Belrysa.{{sic}} I am a priestess of the moon... a [[night elf]].

You might not know my people, but the destinies of our two races have been linked since the Curse befell you.

== Notes ==
Just northeast of town is what's left of the Bradshaw mill. Inside is a night elf!
