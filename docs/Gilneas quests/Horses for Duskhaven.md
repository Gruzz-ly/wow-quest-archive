==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Gwen Armstead}} in [[Duskhaven]].

==Description==
Saving the horses might've saved the rest of the town. They have plenty of carriages in [[Duskhaven]], but not enough horses to pull them.

Go tell Mayor Armstead that the horses you saved are at her disposal.

I'll get things ready and join you in a bit.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||17}}

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. I think I speak for everyone here when I say the sooner we get out of here, the better.

== Notes ==
Lorna only offers this quest if players completed her quests last. Otherwise, Gramma will offer [[Ready to Go]] or Sebastian will offer [[Escape By Sea]].

==Progression==
{{Exodus from Duskhaven}}
