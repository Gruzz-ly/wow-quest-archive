==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Gwen Armstead}} in [[Stormglen]].

==Description==
Our carriage drivers were told to regroup in the fishing town of Stormglen. Our scouts report there might be shelter and supplies to be found there.

Meet Gwen Armstead there, she'll be in charge of taking care of our people.

==Completion==
It's good to see you made it, <name>. It looks like most everybody did.

We're not doing too bad so far for an emergency evacuation.

== Notes ==
Follow the trail south to Stormglen. Gwen's inside the inn.
