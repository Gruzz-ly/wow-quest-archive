==Objectives==
Kill 6 Howling Banshees.
*[[Howling Banshee]] slain

==Description==
The [[night elf|night elves]] have taught us much during this time, <name>. They've taught us who we are and where we come from.

Thanks to them... thanks to [[Tal'doren|this place]]... we're no longer [[Mindless state|mere beasts]]. We have regained free will.

The [[Forsaken]] aren't here for our land alone.

They're looking for something we possess. An artifact capable of uncontrollably spreading the Curse to all humanity. We cannot let them find it.

{{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Sylvanas}}'s [[banshee]]s come very close. Help my trackers take them out.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3}}

==Progress==
You're back, <name>.

==Completion==
You are as good as I remember, <name>. It is good to have you back.

== Notes ==
Plenty of banshees in the area with Moonleaf, so make sure to pick up [[Preparations]] before heading out to kill them.

On complete a script event happens:

:{{text|say|Lord Darius Crowley|Get our men in position immediately, Tobias. We cannot let this fall into the hands of the [[Forsaken]]!}}
:{{text|say|Tobias Mistmantle|It will be done!}}
