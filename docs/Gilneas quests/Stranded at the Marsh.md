==Objectives==
Rescue 5 Crash Survivors at the [[Hailwood Marsh]].
*[[Crash Survivor]] rescued (5)

The [[ogre]]s got two of our stagecoaches. This one and the one that fell into the marsh just north of here.

I want you to head there and rescue any survivors while we hatch up a plan to deal with these ogres.
