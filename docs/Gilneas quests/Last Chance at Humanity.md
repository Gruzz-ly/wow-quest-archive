==Completion==
I need you to pull through, <name>. This dosage is strong enough to kill a horse.

But I know you. I know what you're made of. You will be fine.

Trust me. I know what you're going through.

Now drink up and close your eyes.

== Notes ==
* The player awakes, locked in a Pillory. Krennan Arnas, Lord Godfrey, and Genn Greymane stand before you. 

Before accept:
:{{text|say|[[Krennan Aranas]]|I am not giving up on you, <name>. I don't have a cure for the Curse yet... but there are treatments. You will have control again.}}
:{{text|say|[[Lord Godfrey]]|Give it up, Krennan. It's time to put this one down. It's protocol.}}
:{{text|say|King Genn Greymane|Tell me, Godfrey. Those that stayed in [[Gilneas City]] so that we could live. Were they following protocol?}}
:{{text|say|King Genn Greymane|I didn't think so. Now, hand me that potion, Krennan... and double the dosage.}}

After completing the quest, the three named NPCs disappear and Godfrey stands toward the exit. Players are released from the stocks and phase in to the real world.

*Godfrey, Krennan, and Genn are all referring to the [[Mindless state]] which afflicts those who have been feral [[Worgen]] for too long without a cure.
