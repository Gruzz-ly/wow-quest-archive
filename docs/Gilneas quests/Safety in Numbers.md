==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Genn Greymane||King Genn Greymane}} in the military district.

==Description==
;Option 1
:There's only so much I can teach right now with all these [[worgen]] trying to dismember us.
:We really should think about heading south with the other survivors. We've been told that King Greymane is there.
:If we stick together our chances of survival will increase... especially if you pick someone nutritious-looking to stand next to.

;Option 2
:I've taught you all that is practical for now.
:It is time we joined with the other survivors. The others mentioned that King Greymane and his royal guard are just south of here.
:We should go there and seek safety in numbers.

;Priest

You've done well in coming here. If we [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilneans]] stick together we might yet defeat this terrible enemy.
