==Objectives==
Kill 6 Vilebrood Skitterers in [[Stormglen]].
*[[Vilebrood Skitterer]] slain x6

==Description==
Well, what do you know, <name>? All this time and Stormglen's been left mostly intact.

It's too bad the [[Forsaken]] are still working their way inland, but it'll make a fine place to rest our feet for a night or two.

The other half of town is overrun with spiders, so I've asked the villagers to stay away from there.

Perhaps you'd like to lend a hand in clearing the spiders out? I'm certain our injured men and women will sleep more soundly if they know someone's keeping those eight-legged beasts at bay.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||2|25}}

==Progress==
You're back, <name>. Have the spiders been taken care of?

==Completion==
You've done well, <name>. The spiders are everywhere, however, and I'm afraid we've barely put a dent in their numbers.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Pieces of the Past]] before heading out.

There are spiders everywhere east of the first few buildings.
