==Description==
<name>! I'm still not sure if you're alive or dead... human or worgen...

==Progress==
These blaggards aren't so tough now, are they?

==Completion==
Yes, <name>! Just like old times...

I'm going to have to work hard at not shooting you, but {{NPC||Krennan Aranas||Krennan}} explained everything to us.
