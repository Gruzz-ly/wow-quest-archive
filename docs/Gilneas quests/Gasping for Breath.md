==Objectives==
Rescue 4 Drowning Watchmen.
*{{NPC||Drowning Watchman}} rescued x4

==Description==
<name>! I was on my way when it happened.

No time to waste. A good half of the town watch was in the area that collapsed. Get in there and save as many as you can.

Make sure to get them out of the water and onto shore. I'll make sure they get any aid they need.

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Minor Healing Potion|q1=2|Minor Mana Potion}}
You will also receive: {{cost||1|25}}

==Progress==
There aren't many of us left, <name>. We have to look out for those remaining [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilneans]].

==Completion==
You did what you could, <name>. With any luck a few others will find their way to shore.

== Notes ==
Hop in the water and start swimming. There are plenty of watchmen drowning all over the brand new bay. Pick one up and return to shore. Keep an eye out for the {{NPC||Forsaken Survivor}}s... Even the Cataclysm won't stop their attack. 

On reaching shore with a survivor:
*{{text|say|Thank you... *gasp* I owe you my life.}}
*{{text|say|The land gave way from under our feet... I thought I was dead. I owe you one.}}
*{{text|say|I... I thought I was a goner. Thanks.}}
