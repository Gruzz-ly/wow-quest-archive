==Objectives==
Slay Brothogg the Slavemaster inside [[Emberstone Mine]].
*[[Brothogg the Slavemaster]] slain {{co|80.3|32.1|Gilneas||2|link=Gilneas (starting zone)}}

==Description==
I was one of the few that escaped, <name>. When the [[Forsaken]] took over our town and mine, they treated us with utmost cruelty.

Those of us who were weak and could not endure hard labor were worked to death by the [[abomination]] known as Brothogg.

My wife was among his victims, <class>, and I swore that one day her death would be avenged. I am too frail now, but you can deliver justice... for my wife... for Gilneas!

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
I thank you, <name>. Our people will no longer suffer under that monstrosity's yolk.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Liberation Day]] and [[Last Meal]] before heading out.

Head northwest, enter the mine and loop south, taking the first right. Brothogg is at the bottom of the mine in the back.
