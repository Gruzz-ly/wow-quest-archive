==Objectives==
Bring 5 [[Mountain Horse]]s to [[Lorna Crowley]] at the [[Crowley Orchard]].

==Description==
Listen, <name>. We're not going to make it very far without transportation, are we?

If we just hightail out of here, the forsaken will catch up to us in no time at all.

Rounding up some horses from the stable grounds southeast of here would normally be a breeze, but there's one snag.

That last quake must've spooked [[Koroth the Hillbreaker|Koroth]], the [[ettin]], down from the mountains. If we don't get our horses soon, I fear that he will.

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Lorna's Gloves|Crowley's Belt}}
You will also receive: {{cost||1|25}}

==Progress==
You're back, <name>.

==Completion==
We've got the horses, I'll make sure Duskhaven gets them.

== Notes ==
Run southeast across the bridge to the stable grounds. Hop on a horse and use the horse's ability to round up five others. Then run back to Lorna. Watch out for [[Koroth the Hillbreaker]]!

==Progression==
{{Exodus from Duskhaven}}
