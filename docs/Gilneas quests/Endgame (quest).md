==Objectives==
Jump on a [[Hippogryph (Gilneas)|Hippogryph]] when {{NPC||Tobias Mistmantle||Tobias}} signals you and destroy the [[Horde]] Gunship.
*[[Gunship]] destroyed

==Description==
We need to get rid of that flying gunship if our people have any chance of escaping.

Here's the plan. [[Keel Harbor]] had its share of rebel symphatizers in the old days. I've managed to round up a hefty amount of incendiary explosives from one of our storehouses.

We're going to hit the enemy with a force small enough to fly undetected. The [[night elf]] hippogryphs should do the trick.

Tobias will give you the signal when we're ready to go.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||15}}

==Progress==
The only risks worth taking are the ones that lead to victories worth having.

==Completion==
We did it, <name>. We've started the evacuation. If we leave soon we'll leave the Forsaken fleet in the dust.

==Notes==
This is a timed event that starts every few minutes. Wait for Tobias to give the ok:
*{{text|say|Tobias Mistmantle|We must wait for the right time to strike!}}
*{{text|say|Tobias Mistmantle|Hold your horses, friend. We'll hit them when we're all ready.}}
*{{text|say|Tobias Mistmantle|Patience, friends. We will strike soon.}}
*{{text|say|Tobias Mistmantle|We'll set flight once everyone is ready.}}
*{{text|say|Tobias Mistmantle|We must bide our time. They won't know what hit them.}}
*{{text|say|Tobias Mistmantle|Let's give everyone time to gather. We'll need a handful of people to come with us.}}

Finally:
*{{text|say|Tobias Mistmantle|Hop on a hippogryph, now's our chance!}}
*{{text|say|Tobias Mistmantle|Time to go!}}

Hop on a hippogryph!
:''The hippogryph will take a trek to the top of the airship and drop the player off up top, met by some grunts.''
:{{text|yell|Lorna|Attack!}}
:{{text|yell|Lorna|Secure the rafters!}}
:{{text|yell|Lorna|I want two sharpshooters to stay behind and cover the deck. Everyone else, use the ropes to repel down. Let's give them hell!}}
:''The boarding party rappels down to the deck, heading to the captain's quarters astern. Follow them''
:{{text|yell|Lorna|Hands up! My men will give you your new bearing. You try anything funny and we'll fill you with lead.}}
:{{text|say|Navigator|[Orcish] Dabu?}}
:{{text|yell|Lorna|The rest of you, follow me downstairs!}}
:''The gunship starts moving as Lorna leads the party down to the engineering room below deck and sets some explosives.''
:{{text|say|Lorna|We've got the explosives in the furnace room. Just hold them off now!}}
:''[[Korm Bonegrind]] appears! Finish him off.''
:{{text|say|Lorna Crowley|That's... one big orc.}}
:''The gunship finally reaches its destination: the ruined Greymane Wall! The explosives go off right as it's about to fly into the wall, obliterating everything in the area. The party escapes on wyverns roosting on the lower deck, heading back to Keel Harbor.''

Talk to [[Admiral Nightwind]] on deck of the night elf ship for the next quest.

==Trivia==
*Lorna's line when confronting [[Admiral Stormblood]] originally started with "{{text|yell|Hands up, greenskins!}}" The word "greenskins" was removed from the text at some point, though the audio remains unchanged.

==Progression==
{{Battle for Gilneas City}}
