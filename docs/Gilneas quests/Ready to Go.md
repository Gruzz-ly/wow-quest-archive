==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Gwen Armstead}} in [[Duskhaven]].

==Description==
I suppose now is as good a time to leave as any.

I have my {{item|Grandma's Good Clothes|best outfit}}, my {{item|Linen-Wrapped Book|favorite book}} and my {{item|Chance the Cat|loving cat}}.

I hope I'm not forgetting anything.

Tell that mayor of yours that I'll be on my way. I suppose I'll see you in town with the others!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||85}}
*320 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Gilneas (faction)|Gilneas]]
*[[Little Wolf's Loo]]

==Completion==
You did the impossible, <name>. You convinced {{NPC||Grandma Wahl}} to leave her home.

You are something else, let me tell you.

== Notes ==
Gramma only offers this quest if players completed her quests last. Otherwise, Lorna will offer [[Horses for Duskhaven]] or Sebastian will offer [[Escape By Sea]].
