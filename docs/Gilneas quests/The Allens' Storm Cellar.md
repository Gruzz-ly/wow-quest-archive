==Objectives==
Speak to {{NPC||Lord Godfrey}} inside the storm cellar of the [[Allen Farmstead]] in [[Gilneas (starting zone)|Gilneas]].

Lord Godfrey is leading the attack near the [[Forsaken]]'s landing area. See what you can do to help us keep the Forsaken back.

I've been told Godfrey has commandeered the storm cellar in the Allen Farmstead, far to the west. Seek him there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||65}}

==Completion==
The Forsaken are here in full strength, <name>. We barely have enough men to hold them back.

Exit town to the west, following the road down to the lower level.
