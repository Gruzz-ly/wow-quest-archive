==Objectives==
Take the Grand Tablet to Gunstan.
*[[The Grand Tablet]] (provided)

==Description==
At the bottom of the chest, you find a large tablet. Made of a material resembling stone, but completely smooth and flawless, it is covered in strange writing.

While some resembles the writing on the walls, other scripts appear completely different. Gunstan would probably like to see this.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Hieroglyphic Helm|Translation Boots|Rosy Tablet Belt}}

You will also receive: {{cost|1|40}}

==Progress==
You're back! What have you found? 

==Completion==
This is amazing. These hieroglyphs are undoubtedly titan, but the markings below it...

If I had to hope, this is the same passage written over and over again in an entire assortment of ancient languages. We might be able to use this to decipher the hieroglyphs! If the antechamber was covered in them as you say, who knows what else we'll learn.

I'd like to grant you a fine reward, <name>. We've made the find of the century!
