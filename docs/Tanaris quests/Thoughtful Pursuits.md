==Objectives==
Escort Maru through Benetauk{{sic}}'s puzzle.
* Ask [[Maru]] for a hint (Optional)
* Escort Maru through [[Benatauk|Benetauk]]{{sic}}'s puzzle (0/100%)
* [[Benatauk's Clue Book]] (provided)

==Description==
Maru has been such a good junior sleuth that it's time to reward her with a Thinking Cap of her own!

I can't just hand one over to her, though, so I've buried the parts she'll need to make one herself. I've hidden the coordinates for each part in riddles. Figure out the riddles to find the hiding places!

Would you escort her to make sure she doesn't run into trouble? You can use my Thinking Cap to help. Also, I'll give you a special clue book that will reveal riddles as you progress.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 5x [[Timewarped Badge]]
* [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] (if not acquired from [[Secrets of Azeroth]])

==Progress==
How's it coming along? Maru isn't giving you any trouble, is she?

==Completion==
You did it! And look at that big toothy grin on Maru's face. Thank you so much for helping.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Benatauk|Don't forget to check the clue book for hints on where to go. Have fun!}}

The Tricked-Out Thinking Cap extra action button becomes available. Benatuk also hands over [[Benatauk's Clue Book]], which reads:

{{:Benatauk's Clue Book}}

Speak with Maru for extra hints:
{{Dialogue|
My very own Finking Cap! I can't wait! And you're getting one too?

It's da best day ever!

{{Gossip|{{Text|red|(Hint)}} What do you think about the Location 1 clue?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Let me see. I bet, "start from me," means we need to reset da Finking Cap by Unco Benny.
}}
{{Gossip|{{Text|red|(Hint)}} What do you think about the Location 2 clue?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Clear your head... hmmm. Oh! I bet tat's a hint on where we reset da Finking Cap to make sure da coordinates match!
}}
{{Gossip|{{Text|red|(Hint)}} What do you think about the Location 3 clue?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Companions or combatants. Hmmmmmm... Could tat have somefing to do wiff pets, maybe? Oof, dis last part looks like maffs. Ugh!
}}}}

Use the extra action button while standing at Benatauk to reset to (0, 0), then head to (7, 11) by [[Isaandrae]] and [[Carl Goodup]] to create [[Benatauk's Crystal Ocular Lenses]]:
:{{Text|say|Maru|I fink I found somefing!}}
:{{Text|say|Maru|Yay! Crystal lenses!}}

Note that no interaction is required with NPCs or objects, just getting in range will complete all three of the objectives automatically.

Use the extra action button again to reset, then head to (-5, 7). In the backstage of Fashion Frenzy by [[Kizi Copperclip]], players will create [[Benatauk's Thought Calculating Apparatus]]:
:{{Text|say|Maru|I fink I found somefing!}}
:{{Text|say|Maru|Yeash! Thought-calculating apparatus! Perfect!}}

Finally, reset once more, then head toward [[Taivan]] at (-4, 1) to create [[Benatauk's Downy Helmet Liner]]:
:{{Text|say|Maru|I fink I found somefing!}}
:{{Text|say|Maru|Downy helmet liner! So comfy!}}
:{{Text|say|Maru|We have everything now. Let's return to Unco!}}

Make sure to pet the goodest boy before returning to [[Benatauk]].
