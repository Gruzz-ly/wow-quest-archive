==Objectives==
Use a rock or something to dislodge parts of the mech.

==Description==
Lying on the shore, half-lost in the afternoon spray, is a strange metal contraption. It looks like some kind of mech, but you have never seen anything like it before. You notice a label on its side that reads "Property of [[D.E.L.T.A.]]: Deepsea Exploration and Liquefaction Technologies Alliance". You also spot a small compartment that you might be able to open.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||90}}
*6,600 [[XP]]
*[[Guided Buoyancy Accelerant]]

==Completion==
Using your weapon and field skills you pry the compartment free, revealing a vial of glowing liquid within.

==Progression==
{{Rift Away}}
