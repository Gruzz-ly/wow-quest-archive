== Objectives ==
Kill Captain Dreadbeard.
*[[Captain Dreadbeard]] slain

== Description ==
This is getting pretty fun, but let's not forget we're here for [[Gnomeregan]]!

We spotted the captain of the [[Southsea Pirates|Southsea]] over on one of his boats to the south, past where all the fighting is. He's all alone on his little boat, undefended!

If you go take care of him, we'll have the rest of these pirates mopped up in no time.

== Completion ==
He was controlling a sea giant? Fascinating. If we'd managed to investigate further...

Oh, I mean, wow, that's totally crazy! But thank goodness he's gone, hooray! Mister Noggenfogger will be so pleased.

Here's a nice big reward, you!
