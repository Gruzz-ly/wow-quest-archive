==Objectives==
Defeat [[Kelsey Steelspark]].
*Kelsey Steelspark Defeated
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
It seems we have a special request! I have here a note from one Megs Dreadshredder, requesting to enter the cage and settle a dispute.

She's asked for you to be her partner, <name>. A fan of your previous victories? Or perhaps you're acquainted outside the ring?

I wouldn't back down now if I were you. This is the grand finale...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Thunderdrome Ring
|Kelsey's Necklace
|Dreadshredder Cloak
}}

You will also receive: {{coppercost|21000}} (+{{coppercost|5850}} at max level)

==Progress==
Stop wasting my time. Enter and fight!

==Completion==
Fantastic. I might challenge you to a duel myself someday.
