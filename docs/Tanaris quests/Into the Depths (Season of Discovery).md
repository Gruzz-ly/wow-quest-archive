==Objectives==
Find the [[Altar of Hakkar]] in the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|Sunken Temple]] in {{C|Swamp of Sorrows}}.
*[[Atal'ai Stone Circle]] (provided)

==Description==
Inside the temple, I found a circular room with six balconies, each one with a [[serpent]] statue on the edge. Curious, I pushed one of them to see what would happen, and it was a trap! I nearly fell to my death from the explosion. Laying there on the ledge, I looked down and noticed that there was another statue at the base of the room; an altar of sorts... Hakkar, I think it was called.

I think that this altar is the secret—you must bring this token to the altar in the Sunken Temple.

==Progress==
Upon examining the statue, you notice a depression in its side, just the size of the token that Marvon gave you... 

==Completion==
You push the stone circle into the opening, and you hear it lock into place.

Now that the stone is in place, you may continue... but what should you do next?

Perhaps you should examine this altar further... 

==Notes==
*The altar you are looking for is at the bottom of the [[Sunken Temple (Season of Discovery)|Sunken Temple]]. You'll need to clear the trash before you can click on the altar.
*Clicking on the statue after completing this quest will show you the correct activation sequence for [[Secret of the Circle (Season of Discovery)]].
