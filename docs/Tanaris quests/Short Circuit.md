==Objectives==
Find the inventor of [[Blingtron]].
* Talk to [[Rocket-Chief Fuselage]] in [[Area 52]]
* Talk to [[Ricket]] in [[K3]]
* Talk to [[Chief Engineer Foote]] in [[Ratchet]]
* Talk to [[Nixx Sprocketspring]] in [[Gadgetzan]]
* Talk to [[Winkey]] in eastern [[Tanaris]]
* Find [[Gnopetto Bizzfuse|Gnopetto]]'s [[Gnopetto's workshop|workshop]]

==Description==
While I've got you here, I was wondering if you could track something down for me.

I'm sure you're familiar with a Blingtron, yes? Well, I started askin' around, and it seems no one really knows where the design for it came from. One rumor does pop up more than others, though:

Area 52.

Interested in a field trip?

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Schematic: Blingtron's Circuit Design Tutorial]]

==Progress==
A pile of papers lies on the table. You hope this journey has paid off.

==Completion==
An old schematic, still intact, is floating amongst the papers.

As you examine the schematic you realize that it's the circuit design for Blingtron!

==Notes==
;Rocket-Chief Fuselage
:{{gossip|I'm looking for information about the inventor of Blingtron.}}
::The inventor of the Blingtron unit? Well now, that's quite the question!

::As the legend goes, he was a great, tall fella, 'bout four [[gnome]]s high, with big ol' muscly arms to lift the pieces of his inventions around.

::He had beautiful purple sideburns, and lighting in his eyes!

::Well... at least that's what my cousin Ricket told me.

::She knows the rest of the story, if you really want to know more. You can find her at K3 in the [[Storm Peaks]].

;Ricket
:{{gossip|I'm looking for information about the inventor of Blingtron.}}
::Oh, that old tale? Sure, I can tell it again, if ya like.

::<Ricket raises her hands and begins to talk in a deep voice.>

::So says the legend that he was big like [[fel reaver]], with a face that could spook even ol' [[Deathwing]]. They say he lost his arm makin' the Blingtron unit. Replaced it with a [[Mechano-tank|SPIDER TANK]]!

::<Ricket begins to chuckle a bit.>

::Actually the last real bit of information I heard about him was from this [[sailor]] I met in [[Ratchet]]. Drunk as a skunk, but I believe there was a small bit of truth to what he was sayin'.

::His name is Chief-Engineer Foote. He might be able to give you a real clue as to where you can find the inventor.

;Chief-Engineer Foote
:{{gossip|I'm looking for information about the inventor of Blingtron.}}
::Hic! You wanna ...hic! You wanna ...hic! You wanna know about Blingtron?

::Oh sure, ya, ya, ya. Okay, sho, I wash down in, um ...hic! Oh right!

::I wash down in Gadaget... Gaget... Gadgistan, an' I was talking to thish little green fellow bout him. Come closer.

::<Chief Engineer Foote beckons you closer and starts whispering in your ear, loudly.>

::Sho Nixsh Shprocketshpring ish thish guy'sh name. Ha ha! And he told me, to tell you, to tell ...hic!

::Oh. I forget. Jush leave me alone, would ya.

;Nixx Sprocketspring
:{{gossip|I'm looking for information about the inventor of Blingtron.}}
::You look like a smart fellow, so I'll give you the biggest clue you need. Forget about it!

::Blingtron's the invention of some no-good, dirty, little gnome who don't know nuttin about engineering.

::And DEFINITELY don't go visit his granddaughter, Winkey, down on [[Southbreak Shore]], southeast o' here. She's worse than he was.

;Winkey
:{{gossip|Actually, I'm here to ask you about your grandfather.}}
::My grandfather, Gnopetto Bizzfuse was a great inventor. You may have heard of his one and only invention, the Blingtron unit.

::Everyone wanted to learn his secrets of how he created Blingtron's internal circuitry but he refused to share it.

::He died many years ago after the sea rose and devoured his shop. I doubt you'd be able to find anything more, but if you're up to it, you can go for a swim and check it out.

::You can even borrow [[Winkey's Diving Helmet|my diving helm]] if you like.
