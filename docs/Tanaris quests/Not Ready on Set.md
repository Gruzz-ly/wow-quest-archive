'''Not Ready on Set''' begins the ninth and final hidden local story of [[Guest Relations]], started on 19 November and required for [[Assistant to the Assistant Guest Relations Manager]].

==Objectives==
Find [[Dapperdew]] in [[Ardenweald]].

==Description==
Oh <name>, I am glad to see you again.

My superiors have informed me that I'm responsible not only for the guests here, but everyone putting on celebrations!

Now I'm hearing that Dapperdew in Ardenweald is trying to put on a new play and running into problems.

Would you mind checking in on the situation? I can hardly manage this celebration, let alone whatever is happening in the [[Shadowlands]].
