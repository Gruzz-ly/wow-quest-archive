==Objectives==
Collect 20 Centipaarts from [[Centipaar]] [[Silithid]].
*[[Centipaarts]] (20)

==Description==
Okay, babe. Like I said, the [[ogre]]s are too dumb to know what signing that charter meant. Now we have to actually get them to come along with us, so we'll be procuring what is apparently beloved local flavor.

Beloved local flavor for drooling idiots, I mean.

Just pop on over to the [[Noxious Lair]] to the west, it's that big horrible pit full of dangerous silithid. Kill a bunch of the Centipaar silithid and bring back the pieces so we can hand 'em out, okay? Ciao.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70}}
*6290 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Progress==
Have you got enough? These ogres don't look like the type to like small portions.

==Completion==
Ugh! This entire camp is like a sampler course of awful smells.

Let's not handle these things any longer than we have to.
