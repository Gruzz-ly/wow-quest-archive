'''Deck Dismay''' is the first of the Local Stories objectives of [[Guest Relations]], started on or after 4 November 2024 by picking up the [[Six of Frost (Anniversary)]] from the [[Darkmoon Fortune Card]] behind the crate by [[Alyx]] at the celebration area at the [[Caverns of Time]] in [[Tanaris]]. Check in with [[Alphonse Constant]] with any card in hand to actually pick up the quest.

==Progress==
How's it going? Have you found all my missing cards?

==Completion==
You've found them all? Thank you so much! I'm forever in your debt!

==Notes==
On 4 November, the crate beside [[Alyx]] had a [[Darkmoon Fortune Card]] appear behind it, containing the [[Six of Frost (Anniversary)]]. Speak with Alyx after looting it:

{{dialogue|{{gossip|I found this Darkmoon Fortune card.}}

Oh, how curious! I wonder if some guest is missing their Darkmoon cards. If so, could you please help them out?}}

The [[Darkmoon Faire]]-aligned character at the celebration is [[Alphonse Constant]] at {{co|63.9|52.4|Tanaris}} near the food vendors and Cho's stage:

{{dialogue|title=Alphonse Constant|Oh, hello there. Sorry, but I'm not open for business just yet.

{{gossip|No problem. What business will you eventually be doing here?}}

Fortune telling!

<He starts making a dramatic flourish with his hands but stops halfway and lets his hands fall dejectedly to his sides.>

Well... eventually, I hope.

I guess I should have looked into my OWN future before leaving home though, eh?

<He chuckles uncomfortably.>

{{gossip|quest=|Fortune telling, you say? You wouldn't happen to be using a Darkmoon Fortune Deck for that, would you?}}

As a matter of fact, I do! 

But it looks like there was a tear in my satchel and some cards fell out. Without a complete deck, there's no way I'll be able to do this. 

Not to mention I'm borrowing this deck from my friend Marie-Anne, and what kind of friend would I be if I returned a deck with half of the cards missing?

{{gossip|You know what? I actually found a card earlier! Is this one of the ones you're missing?}}

Oh my, yes! Serendipity be praised!! 

Do you think I could bother you to find the rest? I would gladly compensate you for your time.

{{gossip|quest=|Not a bother at all! I'm happy to help.}}}}

This starts the quest [[Deck Dismay]], and each card found adds 10% progress. Alphonse also has new gossip:

{{dialogue|Hail, friend! Well met! Are you enjoying the festivities?

<He looks around and lowers his voice.>

How goes your search? Oh, if I manage to get out of this pickle without Marie-Anne finding out I "borrowed" her deck, that WOULD make for an enchanted day, wouldn't it?

{{gossip|I'm working on it. Do you remember where you might have dropped any?}}

I've been all over since I got here.

<Alphonse starts counting off with his fingers as he talks.>

I got some food, went to the bathroom, met with the coordinators, and checked out all the events going on.

{{gossip|So, just about anywhere, then. Fantastic. Is that all?}}

<Alphonse smiles and starts nodding.>

Yes, absolutely.

<Alphonse continues to nod as his eyes drift, and he gets a far-away look on his face.>

Well, other than when I ducked under one of the pavilions to change into my fortune-telling costume. I figured it was as fitting a place as any to get changed, seeing as how everyone above me was also changing into different costumes.

And then I wondered if maybe I should hop up there myself to claim some ribbons! This outfit would surely grab enough attention to win, right?

<Alphonse looks back at you and flashes an unconfident smile.>

I mean, yes! Right! What... what was the question again?

{{gossip|Oh, boy...}}}}

[[Maru]] as always has advice too:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|{{text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain the case of Deck Dismay to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

Sounds like da cards could be anywhere around the celebration area. Maybe da idol can find them!}}
