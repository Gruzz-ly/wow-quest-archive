The '''Timely Gate Crashers''' is one of two [[world boss]] weekly quests offered at the [[Bronze Celebration]]. Each week alternates between [[The Originals]] and this one. Unlike the other quest, all three bosses are found in [[Tanaris]].

==Objectives==
Defeat Doomwalker, Sha of Anger, and Archavon the Stone Watcher in [[Tanaris]].
*[[Doomwalker (Anniversary)|Doomwalker]] slain
*[[Sha of Anger (Anniversary)|Sha of Anger]] slain
*[[Archavon the Stone Watcher (Anniversary)|Archavon the Stone Watcher]] slain

==Description==
Did you see that giant mechanical monstrosity just walking around in the dunes outside? How about the icky shadowy Sha of Anger? Or that big frost giant in the north? Yeah, they aren't native to this area.

They tell me the [[timeways]] are screwy around this time of year. They have asked me to organize a clean-up crew.

Would you be up to the challenge? If you like this challenge, I have another for you as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|42}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*{{cost|twb=100}}

==Progress==
How's it going?

==Completion==
You were successful? Great, my new bronze friends tell me things are likely to happen again. So check back with me in, say... a week and I might run another clean-up. In the meantime, feel free to check for them menacing around even more often.

==Notes==
* [[The Gatecrashers]] achievement requires the same three world bosses.
* This quest reuses the ID from [[Doomwalkin' Has Come Knockin']].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.2.5|note=Now awards 100x [[Timewarped Badge]] instead of [[Bronze Celebration Cache of Treasures]]/[[Timely Goodie Bag]] and 3x [[Bronze Celebration Token]].}}
*{{Patch 11.0.5|note=Added, replacing [[Doomwalkin' Has Come Knockin']].}}
