==Objectives==
Collect 5 Ocular Crystals from [[Glasshide Gazer]]s.
*[[Ocular Crystal]] (5)

==Description==
You're going out to hunt hyenas, eh? If you don't mind, I've got an offer myself. I'm in need of eyes from the Glasshide Gazers that lurk to the north. Their eyes contain wonderful crystals, valuable to...collectors.

Now, you may have heard that some sad individuals use these to enhance paramental abilities, but I assure you, my interests are purely academic!

Bring me a good portion of them and I'll pay you well for them. Better than these copper-pinching goblins will, at least!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

==Progress==
Do, ah, do you have them? 

==Completion==
Ahh, perfect! Just what I need...full of potent focusing energies...

...ahem! I mean, perfect for my collection! Narain Soothfancy is in no need of artificial enhancement of any kind!

Now take your pay and be off!
