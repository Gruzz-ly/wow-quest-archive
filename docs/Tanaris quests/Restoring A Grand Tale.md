'''Restoring A Grand Tale''' concludes the second of of the Local Stories objectives of [[Guest Relations]], started on or after 5 November 2024 by [[Raenie Fizzlebog]] at the celebration area at the [[Caverns of Time]] in [[Tanaris]]. 

This quest is required for [[Assistant to the Assistant Guest Relations Manager]].

==Objectives==
Return a Green Hills of Stranglethorn to [[Raenie Fizzlebog]] outside the [[Caverns of Time]].
* Ask [[Maru]] for a hint (Optional)
* [[Green Hills of Stranglethorn (Anniversary)]]
* [[Shredded Green Hills of Stranglethorn]] (provided)

==Description==
It was terrible! My book was shredded and the pages flew everywhere!

I saw some caught in the [[Sand Devil|sand devils]] that went down the tunnel, and others caught on adventurers heading out to face the big monsters in Tanaris, and others are scattered around here. Maybe that [[Idol of Ohn'ahra|bird thing of yours]] could help find them?

Please help me get the pages back so I can restore my book!

Oh, and watch out for that shady [[Cravitz Lorent]]. He's selling new copies for a hundred gold under the [[Fashion Frenzy]] stage. Robbery!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 5x [[Bronze Celebration Token]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find all the pages and repair my book?

==Completion==
;Found
:The bindings are a little loose and some pages are a bit... rough, but it is all here. Especially my favorite passage, it always reminded me of something [[Addie Fizzlebog|Addie]] used to tell me growing up.
:I can't thank you enough for helping me! Alyx said to give you this for your help.
;Bought
:Oh, it looks almost new! You did a great job. I can't thank you enough.
:Alyx said to give you this for your help! And if we could keep this between us, that would be great. No need to let my sister Addie know that I almost lost her gift.

==Notes==
As the quest text indicates, the built-in skip is purchasing a copy of the book from [[Cravitz Lorent]] at {{co|63.6|48.7|Tanaris}} under the [[Fashion Frenzy]] stage for {{cost|100}}. However, the clues do lead to new crates, so...

As always, check in with [[Maru]]:
{{dialogue|title=Maru|{{gossip|{{text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain the case of Restoring a Grand Tale to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

I bet you could find some of those pages around here using your idol! And maybe da sand devils have some, they like to hide in da Cavern of Time.

But if some of da pages went out wiff adventurers, you might have to get them back from da big baddies around Tanaris, like [[Doomwalker (Anniversary)|Doomwalker]]!}}

<onlyinclude>Use the [[Idol of Ohn'ahra]] to find pages scattered across the celebration area:
* [[Green Hills of Stranglethorn - Page 6 (Anniversary)]] - Anniversary World Bosses in Tanaris + Dragons of Nightmare, Kazzak, Azuregos
* [[Green Hills of Stranglethorn - Page 11 (Anniversary)]] - Anniversary World Bosses in Tanaris + Dragons of Nightmare, Kazzak, Azuregos
* [[Green Hills of Stranglethorn - Page 16 (Anniversary)]] - {{co|61.9|49.8|Tanaris}} [[Loose Paper]] by the doghouse in the battle pet area not far from [[Taivan]] and [[Voidfire]]
* [[Green Hills of Stranglethorn - Page 18 (Anniversary)]] - {{co|64.5|51.8|Tanaris}} [[Wet Paper]] behind the Story Time stage
* [[Green Hills of Stranglethorn - Page 21 (Anniversary)]] - {{co|63.6|47.8|Tanaris}} [[Folded Paper]] by the outhouse behind the Fashion Frenzy stage
* [[Green Hills of Stranglethorn - Page 25 (Anniversary)]] - [[Sand Devil]]s inside the [[Caverns of Time]] - may take several kills
* [[Green Hills of Stranglethorn - Page 27 (Anniversary)]] - [[Sand Devil]]s inside the [[Caverns of Time]] - may take several kills

While the quest is active, pages 6 or 11 are guaranteed drops from all six anniversary bosses, but they are on the daily loot lockout. Duplicates can drop, so it may take more than two boss kills. Pages 25 and 27 are high (but not guaranteed) drops from the Sand Devils inside the Caverns of Time cave heading down to the lower level. Duplicates can also drop here, so keep killing until both pages drop.

In addition to the pages directly required for this quest, several other notes showed up at the same time:
*{{co|63.2|52.0|Tanaris}} [[Ruffled Paper]] / [[Next Week's Mount Competition Listing]] by Raenie Fizzlebog and Farmer Yoon
