'''A Pirate Predicament''' begins the third chapter of the [[Guest Relations]] storyline, first made available on 13 November.

==Objectives==
Head to the [[Booty Bay]] [[Buccaneer]]s camp.

==Description==
I was recently made aware of a small group of Booty Bay Buccaneers who have landed and set up camp just outside the celebration area to the north.

Pirates aren't inherently a problem, per se, but they do introduce an element of chaotic unpredictability. I know you're busy, but would you mind checking on them to see if they need any assistance?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
Ahoy there! You look like a capable thinker. Got a sec to lend a hand?

==Notes==
Head to the marked quest location on the map, northwest of the Caverns of Time on the shoreline of [[Waterspring Field]] to find [[Bonenose]] and two [[Booty Bay Buccaneer]]s. Bonenose is not tagged as part of the [[Booty Bay]] faction.
