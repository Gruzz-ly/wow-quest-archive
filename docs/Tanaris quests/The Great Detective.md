'''The "Great" Detective''' concludes the second day of [[Guest Relations]]. On 31 October, the storyline continues with [[Tracking Quest]].

==Objectives==
Solve the mystery of [[Herrkrop]]'s disappearance.
* Ask [[Maru]] for a hint (Optional)
* Mystery solved (0/100%)

==Description==
The missing guest? Yes, some Herrkrop fellow. Not to worry, I've already solved the case.

He probably just got lost. Relax, <class>. Enjoy the festivities! Our missing guest will show up soon enough.

If you don't believe me, go... I don't know... solve it yourself. Interrogate someone or other.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 5x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Progress==
Have you any luck in finding our missing guest?

==Completion==
So that's what happened?

<[[Alyx]] sighs.>

Thank you for your help. I will work on finding a lead to track down [[Scrapes]].

Check back in tomorrow, if you would.

==Notes==
Speak with Jones again:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|What do you know about Herrkrop?}}

Ugh. If you insist on pursuing this case, then at least do it properly!

Don't ask me, go out and look for clues. Surely someone has seen hide or hair of this Herrkrop. Come to think of it, his fellow adventurers are surely nearby.

And remember--always trust your first guess!}}

Before heading out, either use a [[Spiritual Incense]], or speak with [[Maru]] at her usual spot next to [[Benatauk]]:

{{dialogue|How's the sleufing going?

{{gossip|{{text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain your primary case to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

I bet someone around here knows where your missing person is. Try using the idol to find witnesses!

I fink it's time for a widdle intewwogation!}}

[[File:The Great Detective - Team Solid.jpg|thumb|Duryllin, Juddson Rakes, and Ellanoir of Team Solid]]
Use the [[Idol of Ohn'ahra]] and look for targets. The three members of Team Solid at {{co|63.8|51.0|Tanaris}} all have something to say, but only if spoken with in the right order:

{{dialogue|title=[[Ellanoir]]|{{gossip|Do you know Herrkrop?}}

As well as the inside of a Reaves module! And like Reaves, he's cold on the outside with an electric personality.

{{gossip|Where did you last see Herrkrop?}}

I haven't seen him since we got back from the Broken Isles. Maybe one of the others knows where he ended up.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Duryllin]]|{{gossip|Do you know Herrkrop?}}

Aye, he's a good friend. True tae the end.

{{gossip|What were you doing on the Broken Isles?}}

Killin' demons, what else?

We cleared a right number of them outta Val'sharah afore we heard the call tae celebrate here.

Had to pull Juddson away by force tae take time off. He's very passionate about demon hunting.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Juddson Rakes]]|{{gossip|Surely a demon hunter of your skill has a moment to talk.}}

You've heard of me? Alright, what's your question?

{{gossip|Where did you last see Herrkrop?}}

He said he had some business to deal with...

I myself don't know what business he means to conduct, but Ellanoir likely does.}}

{{dialogue|title=Ellanoir (again)|
{{gossip|What business was Herrkrop doing?}}

Oh, did Juddson say he was on a business trip?

<Ellanoir giggles.>

When Herrkrop leaves for "business" he just heads to the nearest beach. He loves a drink by the sea.}}

At this point, you can ask [[Maru]] for another hint:
{{dialogue|Last seen at a beach, huh? Wavestrider Beach is not too far from here.

Maybe your torch can reveal da clues!}}

[[File:Abandoned Beach Chair.png|thumb|[[Abandoned Beach Chair]]]]
At this point, players should be at 48% progress. If players head south out of the celebration area, they may come across an [[Abandoned Beach Chair]] at {{co|66.0|59.5|Tanaris}} on [[Southbreak Shore]]. Attached is a note:

{{Dialogue|<hastily scrawled note lies on the chair.>

Sun's better on the other side.<br>
- [[Herrkrop]]}}

[[File:The Great Detective - Nat and the sand.jpg|thumb|Nat Pagle and some suspicious sand]]
Head north out of the celebration area to [[Wavestrider Beach]] to find [[Nat Pagle]] at {{co|65.9|40.4|Tanaris}} doing his thing, fishing. Nat doesn't have anything relevant to say, but the Idol keeps pointing at the sand pile that can be revealed as a [[Buried Object (Tanaris)|Buried Object]] next to him, so break out the [[Torch of Pyrreth]] to reveal a [[Desert Crawler]] crab from the sand pile, adding 12% progress. It skitters off to the east into the water. Other objects may be burned away to reveal [[Discarded Trash]] that can be kicked great lengths, for no other benefit that the joy inherent in the action.

[[File:The Great Detective - Scrapes, Herrkrop, and Athelton.jpg|thumb|Athelton, Herrkrop, and Scrapes]]
This changes the Idol's target, so head over to [[Scrapes]]. If the torch is still out, it will burn away the sand pile behind him, revealing the corpse of [[Herrkrop]] and adding another 12% progress!

Revealing the corpse causes Athelton Jones to suddenly ride up in a [[Rowboat (Anniversary)|Rowboat]] and hop out onto the beach.
:{{text|say|Athelton Jones|Just as I suspected, our missing persons case is now... a murder investigation!}}
:{{text|say|Athelton Jones|As I say, always trust your first guess! Thank you for aiding me, <class>, but I've got it from here.}}

The progress bar should now be at 60%. Check in with the characters nearby.

At this point, you can ask [[Maru]] for another hint:
{{dialogue|It sounds like time for more intewwogation! Look for witnesses near the beach.
}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Herrkrop]]|<The corpse appears to have been stabbed and is missing several bones and organs.>}}

{{dialogue|title=Athelton Jones|
{{gossip|What should I do now?}}

Absolutely nothing. This case is basically solved. As I say, always trust your first instinct!

Besides, I doubt anyone here saw anything.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Scrapes]]|Leave me alone. You're blocking my sunlight.

{{gossip|Aren't you undead?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
What's it to you? I said leave me alone!

<Scrapes mutters a few particularly offensive words about you and your mother.>
}}

{{gossip|Did you witness anything suspicious recently?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
What's it to you? I said leave me alone!

<Scrapes mutters a few particularly offensive words about you and your mother.>
}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Nat Pagle|Great day for fishin', ain't it? Haha!

{{gossip|Did you witness anything suspicious recently?}}

Can't say I have. But the fish are biting great today!}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Julia Henning]]|Greetings, friend.

{{gossip|Did you witness anything suspicious recently?}}

Why, I did actually!

I saw that Forsaken fellow making quite a noise behind those tents. It's had me in a nervous wreck all morning! And look here--I found this bloody knife in the sand just a stone's throw from where he's sitting now.

Please, take it and bring that... that monster to justice!}}

This should get the progress to 96%. At this point, you can ask [[Maru]] for another hint:
{{dialogue|Have you told Detective Jones about this? It sounds like he's the one tat you should be talking to!
}}

Check back with Athelton Jones:

{{dialogue|{{gossip|I think I know who did it.}}

You think you can outsmart the great Detective Jones?

Fine, I'll hear you out. What's your hypothesis?

{{plainlist|
*{{gossip|It was Julia Henning.}}
{{dialogue-child|What evidence do you have? No, no, that can't be right.}}
*{{gossip|It was Scrapes.}}
:''Continues the event.''
*{{gossip|It was Nat Pagle.}}
{{dialogue-child|What evidence do you have? No, no, that can't be right.}}
*{{gossip|Herrkrop killed himself!}}
{{dialogue-child|What evidence do you have? No, no, that can't be right.}}
*{{gossip|It was me, I did it!}}
{{dialogue-child|I admire your confession, but I sincerely doubt that.}}
*{{gossip|It was YOU, Detective Jones!}}
{{dialogue-child|Me? Why, that's preposterous poppycock!}}
:{{gossip|Wait, I changed my mind.}}
}}}}

After choosing Scrapes:
:{{text|say|Athelton Jones|Yes, of course! Let us confront the suspect.}}
:''Scrapes hops in Athelton's rowboat and takes off.''
:{{text|say|Athelton Jones|He's getting away!}}
:{{text|say|Athelton Jones|Damn. Now we'll never find him. Time to call this one a cold case.}}
:''Athelton runs the other way.''

Julia has new gossip:
{{dialogue|That's it? You're just giving up?

There's no telling how many more murders might happen with that cretin on the loose!}}

Return to [[Alyx]] back at the celebration area to turn in.

==Trivia==
*Nat's first line of gossip is a reference to Baelin from the web series "Epic NPC Man," who exclusively says the phrase "Mornin'! Nice day for fishin', ain't it? Haha!"
