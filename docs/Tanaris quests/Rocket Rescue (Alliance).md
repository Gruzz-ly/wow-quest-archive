== Objectives ==
Deliver Liferockets to 5 Steamwheedle Survivors and use bombs to kill 40 Southsea Blockaders.
*Life Rockets Delivered (5)
*[[Southsea Blockader]] slain (40)

== Description ==
When the water came in, Steamwheedle Port to the east was flooded, and a lot of poor goblins are still stuck there! Now those mean pirates are shooting at any boat that leaves the docks here.

But they won't expect us to fly! There's a hot air balloon by the docks. We can use that, fly over to rescue the goblins, and take care of the pirates, too. Mr. Noggenfogger will be so pleased!

Go to the docks and hop in the balloon and I'll be right behind you, okay? I've got to get some rockets...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

==Progress==
Let's not wait around, silly! We weren't done yet! We've gotta get out there!

== Completion ==
That was great! It looks like most of the goblins we helped made it back here and didn't blow up. We really showed that [[Megs Dreadshredder|goblin girl]]!

Here's a special reward for you, <mister/miss>.
