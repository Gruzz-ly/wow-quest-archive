'''Find OOX-17/TN!''' involves one of {{questchain|Oglethorpe's Homing Robots}}.

== Objectives ==
Bring the distress beacon to Oglethorpe's homing robot.
*[[OOX-17/TN Distress Beacon]] (Provided)

== Description ==
You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal.  Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption!  A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.

"The name's [[Oglethorpe Obnoticus|Oglethorpe]], and my homing robot has gone missing!  I will reward you for its recovery! Please take this beacon to the robot.  Excellent, I now have computed the coordinates for you!  It crashed near the [[Gaping Chasm]] in [[Tanaris]]!" 

== Progress ==
You appear to have uncovered the wreckage of... a robotic chicken? &nbsp;The voice from within the egg crackles to life again:

"Yes, excellent work! &nbsp;This is indeed my homing robot, though my sensors indicate that it needs a jump start before it can fly back to [[Booty Bay]] for repairs. &nbsp;Go ahead and place the beacon inside the rover. &nbsp;The beacon will take care of the rest!" 

== Completion ==
You place the egg... distress beacon... inside the chicken... homing robot.

Hums and whirs are heard from inside the robot as it struggles to stand up. &nbsp;After the robot comes to life, Oglethorpe's voice is heard once more, but now from inside the robot:

"OOX-17/TN is working at least, but it needs major repairs! &nbsp;It is much too heavy for you to carry it... but I think I have an idea. &nbsp;Are you up for watching over it some more?" 

== Rewards ==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*4400 [[XP]] (or {{cost||26|40}} at level 70)
*-250 [[reputation]] with [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]

== Notes ==
The Homing Robot can be found just east (and north) of [[the Gaping Chasm]], among the hills at, (60,65).
