'''Lost and... Found?''' is the eighth hidden local story of [[Guest Relations]], started on 18 November and required for [[Assistant to the Assistant Guest Relations Manager]].

==Objectives==
Deliver the lost items to their correct owners.
* Collect items from the [[Lost & Found]] chest
* Ask [[Maru]] for a hint (Optional)
* [[Well-Worn Almanac]] returned {{co|63.1|52.0|Tanaris}}
* [[Tiny Mechanical Mouse (Anniversary)]] returned {{co|62.2|49.7|Tanaris}}
* [[Crude Ivory Locket]] returned {{co|63.5|52.2|Tanaris}}
* [[Potion Bottle]] returned
* [[Jade Amulet]] returned {{co|63.4|51.8|Tanaris}}
* [[Alyx's Lost & Found Notes]] (provided)

==Description==
I am so overwhelmed. A group of folks were here a little while ago, all complai... I mean, submitting lost-item notices with great passion, but all at the same time. 

I tried to take down all the details, but in the stress of the moment, I fear they're all jumbled.

I have this collection of items that have been found over the day, and I'm fairly sure these are the items those folks were talking about. Do you think you could use my notes and figure out which item belongs to each person?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 5x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Progress==
How's it going? Have you found the owners of all the lost items?

==Completion==
Have you finished with those items? Oh, bless your heart! I'm actually quite surprised at how few people have lost things during these festivities. Still, I'm simply bursting with gratitude at your willingness to help those unfortunate few who have.

==Notes==
All NPCs for this quest are in the celebration area. Don't head across the world to find them at their usual locations!

Alyx hands over [[Alyx's Lost & Found Notes]], which read:
{{book|content=With everyone talking all at once, my notes don't make a lot of sense. I'm sorry about that. Hopefully there's enough here for you to be able to cross reference or deduce who should get each item. Thanks again for helping me with this!

[[Farmer Yoon]] is standing at {{co|63.1|52.0|Tanaris}} by the Mount Mania area:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|You wouldn't have lost something while you've been here, would you?}}

As a matter of fact, I did, yes. Why do you ask?

{{gossip|<Wrong option>}}
{{dialogue-child|I'm sorry, my what? That isn't what I lost. Thanks for getting my hopes up.<br>

If you'll excuse me, I have a celebration to get back to.}}

{{gossip|Your well-worn journal was found.}}
{{dialogue-child|<Farmer Yoon's eyes light up as he takes the journal from you.>

My grandfather's journal! I'm so happy it was found and turned in. I would have been crushed if this was lost for good. 

Thank you so much for delivering this to me!}}

[[Oglethorpe Obnoticus]] patrols in the vicinity of [[Jepetto Joybuzz]] in the pet playground:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|You wouldn't have lost something while you've been here, would you?}}

I have, why? Are you here to ransom it? You cad!

{{gossip|<Wrong option>}}

{{dialogue-child|Alas, I'm sorry to say this does not belong to me. I must be going now, but good luck with the ransoming!}}

{{gossip|Your tiny mechanical mouse was found.}}

{{dialogue-child|Whiskers McWhiskerFace! You have returned home!

Oh, I thought my dear pet lost for good. Thank you for delivering it to me.

And no ransom either? This IS my lucky day!}}}}

[[File:Mankrik celebration.jpg|thumb|[[Mankrik]]]]
[[Mankrik]] (and [[Mahka]]!) are standing at {{co|63.5|52.2|Tanaris}} south of Mount Mania next to the food stalls:

{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|You wouldn't have lost something while you've been here, would you?}}

I have lost something precious, indeed.

{{gossip|<Wrong option>}}

{{dialogue-child|Humph. Why, exactly, are you wasting my time? Leave me be.}}

{{gossip|Your crude ivory locket was found.}}

{{dialogue-child|Ah! My heart returns to me! 

I keep a lock of my dear [[Olgra]]'s hair in this locket. It is irreplaceable. 

Thank you for delivering this to me.}}}}

[[File:Marin Noggenfogger celebration.jpg|thumb|[[Marin Noggenfogger]]]]
[[Marin Noggenfogger]] patrols, so consider <code>/tar Marin</code> macros to more easily locate him.

{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|You wouldn't have lost something while you've been here, would you?}}

I have, yes. I'm sure it's lost to the ages at this point, though.

{{gossip|<Wrong option>}}

{{dialogue-child|No, I'm afraid you are mistaken. This clearly belongs to someone else.

Now, if you'll excuse me.}}

{{gossip|Your potion bottle was found.}}

{{dialogue-child|<Marin grabs the bottle and turns it over in his hands, checking it for any damage.>

Bless my coin purse! Do you have any idea how expensive it is to get these engraved like this?

Thanks so much for delivering it to me.}}

[[John J. Keeshan]] is standing at {{co|63.4|51.8|Tanaris}} by the Mount Mania area:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|quest=|You wouldn't have lost something while you've been here, would you?}}

Maybe. Maybe not. 

Why do you ask?

{{gossip|<Wrong option>}}
{{dialogue-child|<Keeshan looks at the item then slowly back to you.><br>

Do not bother me with this nonsense.}}

{{gossip|Your jade amulet was found.}}
{{dialogue-child|<Keeshan lets loose a short gasp as he takes the jade amulet from you.>

I would have been gutted if this was lost forever, but I never doubted the good natures of those gathered here.

Thank you for delivering this to me. A thousand times, thank you.}}}}
