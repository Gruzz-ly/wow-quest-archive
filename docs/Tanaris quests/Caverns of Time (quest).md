==Objectives==
Meet with [[Anachronos]] at the [[Caverns of Time]].

==Description==
Were the shard of the [[:Vision of Time]] not depleted, I could use it to send you on your way. But my specialization is [[teleportation]], not [[chronomancy]].

Time magic was the province of our former leader, Grand Magistrix [[Elisande]]. Much of her knowledge died with her.

It is said Elisande had mastered incantations known only to the [[bronze dragonflight|bronze dragons]]. Perhaps they would be willing to aid your cause.

==Completion==
Is it time for you to visit me already? Yes, I suppose it is then.

After accepting the quest, use the portal to [[Orgrimmar]] and use the Caverns of Time portal in the [[Pathfinder's Den]] to travel to the Caverns of Time in [[Tanaris]]. Anachronos is in the central chamber.
