==Objectives==
Search [[Bilgewater Footlocker]]s for evidence.
*[[Salt-Crusted Journal]]

==Description==
[[Gnomeregan (kingdom)|Gnomeregan]] previously learned that the [[Bilgewater Cartel|Bilgewater]] [[goblin]]s of the [[Horde]] survived a crash on an uncharted island near [[Kalimdor]] before arriving in [[Durotar]]. We initially came here to investigate what techniques and technology could possibly allow a hopeless pack of imbeciles to survive such harsh conditions.

While the goblins are at a loss, we still need to find out exactly what happened here. Search the beach for wreckage and belongings and bring anything that appears significant back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|7000}} (+{{coppercost|3750}} at max level)

==Progress==
What have you found?

==Completion==
<Kelsey takes the journal and gingerly flips through it.>

I'm trying not to laugh. This is classic. They have no idea they're even on Kalimdor!

These later pages though...something more significant may be occurring here.
