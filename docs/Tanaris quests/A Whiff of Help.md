Purchase and use a Spiritual Incense from [[Benatauk]].
*[[Spiritual Incense]] purchased

*Speak with [[Maru]]'s spirit

==Description==
You seem quite equipped for solving secrets now! As much as I expect Maru would want to come with you, she's far too young.

Fortunately, we Tuskarr have an incense that lets our souls communicate across long distances.

I keep a stock of it on me if you need. As a friend of Maru, I will only charge you for the cost of materials.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|34}}
*5x [[Spiritual Incense]]

==Progress==
Have you tried the incense?

==Completion==
Now you see the power of our spiritual connections.

Here, take a few with you.

==Notes==
Buy the incense from Benatauk and use it, which summons a ghostly Maru:
