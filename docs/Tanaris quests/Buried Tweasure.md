==Notes==
===Treasure one===
Maru hands over the [[Ancient Treasure Notes]], which initially read:

{{book|content=ANCIENT TREASURE NOTE

In shifting dunes and ancient stone, find the gateway to forgotten halls where time and titanic secrets meet.}}

Speak with Maru for her hint:

{{dialogue|{{gossip|{{text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain your primary case to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

<Maru giggles.>

Oohh you need help with the riddle? Look in the south area near da [[Valley of the Watchers]].}}

Southwest in [[Tanaris]] is the [[Valley of the Watchers]]. Enter the [[Ruins of Uldum]] and whip out the [[Idol of Ohn'ahra]] to find an [[Ancient Treasure Note]] at {{co|37.6|84.1|Tanaris}} in the corner of the room. Interact with it to get to 25% progress, and the idol points at a new target. This updates the journal:
{{book|content=ANCIENT TREASURE NOTE

You've found your way to an ancient site, your next location is a lot more bright.

But first, look nearby and search for clues, then start at the chest with the cap that you use.}}

Maru too:

{{dialogue|You found a note? Oh yeah! You have to look for...

I mean, it sounds like there might be somefing in da ruins tat you need to find.

If it happens to be somefing wiff numbers, you probably have to use them for your finking cap and start at the chest tat's there. Just a hunch.

<Maru tries to hide a smile.>}}

===Treasure two===
The idol points to an [[Ancient Toy]] in the form of Maru's sailboat at {{co|37.3|82.9|Tanaris}} in the northwest corner half-buried in the sand pile. Interact with it:
{{dialogue|The sails have the number 70 drawn on them. The sails seem to be angled east.}}

Nearby at {{co|37.4|82.7|Tanaris}} is an Ancient Toy:
{{dialogue|The sword is positioned at an exact 132 degree angle from the wall.

You can tell because a [[Measuring Compass|measuring compass]] is resting next to the sword at exactly 132 degrees.}}

Head to the [[Antediluvean Chest]] at {{co|37.8|84.1|Tanaris}} along the south wall and reset the [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] to (0, 0), then navigate northeast to (70, 132). There, or at {{co|47.5|56.5|Tanaris}}, find another Ancient Treasure Note tucked up against a rock. This gets to 50% progress, updating the journal:
{{book|content=ANCIENT TREASURE NOTE

Beyond the brutes and spooky bones, there's a place that trolls call home.

Look outside with flames in hand to find the treasure you demand.}}

And Maru:
{{dialogue|Tat sounds like [[Zul'Farrak]] to me!

But you probably want to stay outside the gates and look around wiff da [[Torch of Pyrreth|stick of revealing]].}}

===Treasure three===
Head northwest to the exterior of [[Zul'Farrak]] and look around with and torch out. Eventually, on the western corner of the wall around the instance line at {{co|38.8|22.1|Tanaris}}, the torch will reveal the third Ancient Treasure Note, advancing to 75% progress. The journal gains another page:

{{book|content=ANCIENT TREASURE NOTE

Many goods await you here. From fireworks to fashion, it's all quite near.

Find the mysterious traveller{{sic}} at a place where visitors gather.}}

As does Maru:
{{dialogue|Why don't you try looking around [[Gadgetzan|Gadgyzan]]? I bet you'll find a suuuper mysterious traveller!}}

===Treasure four===
The questline has taught players to check in the inns of towns, so head to the [[Road Warrior]] to find [[Yennu]] at {{co|52.7|26.9|Tanaris}} enjoying some soup:

{{dialogue|Oh! Hello traveller!

{{gossip|Do you know about this ancient treasure?}}

Yes, I am the mysterious merchant. I have super ancient relics for you for completing the ancient riddles.

Take them back to your friend!}}

Yennu hands over some [[Festive Balloons]] and [[Celebratory Fireworks]]. He also has new gossip:

{{dialogue|This soup is SOUP-ER yummy!}}

Return to Maru at the [[Caverns of Time]].
