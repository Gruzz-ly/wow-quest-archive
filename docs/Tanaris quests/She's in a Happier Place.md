==Objectives==
Return to [[Kelsey Steelspark]] in [[Boralus]].

==Description==
Aww, Kelsey...she's been such a good friend. I meant to let her know I was alive eventually, but I got distracted.

[[:Azerite]], [[Fourth War|the war]], the [[Before the Storm|near-death experience]]... We've been really busy. Being presumed dead has some advantages, though. We've done a lot of research and we just need a better lab-

Okay. New plan. Tell Kelsey we'll be in touch, but only Kelsey. Tell everyone else I'm dead - for now. If you keep quiet about [[Grizzek Fizzwrench|Grizzek]], you- you can have Feathers.

Do we have a deal?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Feathers (pet)
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
She's alive?! That's great! I can't wait to catch up and see what she's been working on. I wasn't always a fan of Grizzek's -- he could really grind [[Sapphronetta Flivvers|Saffy]]'s gears! But if they're together again, then it's a packaged deal. Hmmmmm.

<Kelsey looks thoughtful for a moment before a sly grin spreads across her face>

I have an idea or two. You don't worry about a thing, <name>. Enjoy the parrot!
