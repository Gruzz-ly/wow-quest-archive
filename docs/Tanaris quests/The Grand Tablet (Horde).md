== Objectives ==
Take the Grand Tablet to Andoren Dawnrise.
* [[The Grand Tablet]] (provided)

== Description ==
At the bottom of the chest, you find a large tablet. Made of material resembling stone, but completely smooth and flawless, it is covered in strange writing.

While some resembles the writing on the walls, other scripts appear completely different. Andoren would probably like to see this.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Hieroglyphic Helm
|Translation Boots
|Rosy Tablet Belt}}
You will also receive: {{cost|1|40}}

== Progress ==
You're back! What have you found?

== Completion ==
This is truly incredible. The hieroglyphs are undoubtedly titan, but the markings below it...

Some of these characters resemble ancient [[Kaldorei]] writings. And you say the antechamber was covered in hieroglyphs?

You've made a find more monumental than any riches, <name>. Please, take whatever reward you prefer.
