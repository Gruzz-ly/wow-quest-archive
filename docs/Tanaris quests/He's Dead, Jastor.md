==Objectives==
Return to [[Gazlowe]] in [[Port of Zandalar|Zandalar Harbor]].
* Speak with [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]]

==Description==
Hey, uh, so I got a good thing goin' on here, and I really don't want Gallywix to know I'm alive.

I'll make you a deal. You spin some story about how you only found tiny pieces of me spread across [[Tanaris]] and that I am totally dead, and... And you can keep the bird.

Deal?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|Feathers (pet)
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Nice work convincing Gallywix, <name>. If I didn't know any better I'd have thought [[Grizzek Fizzwrench|Grizzek]] was actually dead.

He's alive right? Right.

Anyway, here's your bonus pay. Let's just keep this between us, okay?

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Grizzek Fizzwrench|Never get involved in political engineering! Never!}}
:{{Text|say|Grizzek Fizzwrench|Tell him to run if  he's gettin' too close!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Sapphronetta Flivvers]]|We should really be going. Gallywix's goons could find us at any moment!}}
:''Grizzek gets into the driver seat of a [[Hastily-repaired Bike]].''
:{{Text|say|Grizzek Fizzwrench|Right, right. We're all packed, pookie. Ready to go when you are.}}
:{{Text|say|Sapphronetta Flivvers|You take good care of Feathers, <name>!}}

;Gallywix
:Hey! <NAME>!
:You take care of that bad investment, Grizzek Fizzwrench?

:Don't spare any of the details! Come on, spill!

:{{Gossip|He's dead. Where's my payment?}}
:{{Gossip|He's nothing but a smear across the desert. A tiny smear. A series of microscopic bits spread across the sand. He's 100% dead. I got this really awful sunburn looking for all the pieces. And when I found them I blew them up again. Yep. He's dead. Really, really dead.}}
<!-- Selecting either does not change the dialogue. -->
::{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|That's what I like to hear! Nice doin' business with ya, <name>.}}
::{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Gazlowe said he'd take care of your payment. Guess he hated that guy more than I did!}}
::{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Better his pocketbook than mine, HA!}}

*If the questline is done after the release of patch 8.2, Gazlowe will not be on his spot with the other members of the Island Expedition crew. Traveling to Mechagon and back seems to spawn Gazlowe on the spot.
