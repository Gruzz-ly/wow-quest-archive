==Objectives==
Defeat the Echo of Gul'dan at the [[Dark Portal]] in [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Echo of Gul'dan]] slain

==Description==
To attune this shard to the place you wish to go, we must follow some of its history.

The first location we will visit is the Dark Portal in the Blasted Lands.

It was there that {{Au|Gul'dan}} used a piece of the [[:Vision of Time]] to travel between [[alternate timeline|realities]].

Join me there when you are ready.

==Progress==
The Vision of Time still holds power. It just needs to be unlocked.

==Completion==
Gul'dan was a pox upon all lands that he set foot upon. His death was well deserved.

==Notes==
Note that, while this quest is in your character's [[Quest Log]], you are placed in a special [[Phasing|phase]] and will be unable to see certain [[NPC]]s and [[mob]]s nor complete certain other quests.

Travel to the Blasted Lands. Anachronos is standing near the Dark Portal, with a [[Time Rift (Blasted Lands)|Time Rift]] waiting in front of him:

:{{text|say|Anachronos|The echoes of magic here reverberate through the timeways.}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|It was here that Gul'dan once traveled between worlds with the aid of the Vision of Time.}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|Though this is merely an echo of this enemy of Azeroth, know that death at this entity's hands would prove quite real.}}

Click on the time portal. Echoes of Horde soldiers march through the portal, led by the Echo of Gul'dan. The other echoes fade, leaving only Gul'dan.

:{{text|yell|Echo of Gul'dan|You'll never escape my grasp!}}

Attack the Echo of Gul'dan. The echo casts four spells: Felfire Bolt (single-target attack), Fel Efflux (a frontal blast of fel energy), Liquid Hellfire (AoE fel attack), and Death Coil (a [[horrify effect]]). Avoid Fel Efflux and Liquid Hellfire while interrupting, if possible, Death Coil.

:{{text|yell|Echo of Gul'dan|Let the endgame begin!}}
:{{text|yell|Echo of Gul'dan|Drink in the glory!}}
:{{text|yell|Echo of Gul'dan|Burn from within!}}

Should the hero fall:
:{{text|yell|Echo of Gul'dan|Thus do the champions of this world fall!}}

;Gul'dan defeated
:{{text|yell|Echo of Gul'dan|I am Gul'dan! I am darkness incarnate! It cannot end... like this.}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|Gul'dan will not be missed... not in this, nor any other timeline.}}
:{{text|say|Anachronos|Come, we must travel now to the [[Temple of the White Tiger]].}}
