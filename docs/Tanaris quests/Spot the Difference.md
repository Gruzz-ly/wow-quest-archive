'''Spot the Difference''' concludes the fourth day of the [[Guest Relations]] storyline, and of chapter 1 of [[I Saved the Party and All I Got Were These Lousy Hats]]. Chapter two began on 6 November with [[Toy Trouble]].

==Objectives==
Solve the case of the shapeshifting demon.
* Ask [[Maru]] for a hint (Optional)
* Interrogate suspects and witnesses (0/100%) (Optional)
* Identify the shapeshifter
* Ask Maru for a hint (Optional)
* [[Y'lliya Xennin]] slain {{co|60.0|62.5|Tanaris}}

==Description==
Look, I'm the real detective. You believe me, right?

I know--ask me anything. The good people here will be able to corroborate my story and we'll prove that I'm me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|46|84}}
* 10x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Progress==
This is preposterous...

==Completion==
Thank you so much for solving the case, <name>!

Hopefully, this event will be calmer now.

==Notes==
Pick either detective to turn in the last quest and start this one.

Since Maru's close by, may as well check in with her:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|{{text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain your primary case to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

I fink it's time for some intewwogation! Talk to both detectives and follow up on their stories!}}

For the sake of identification, the two detectives will be referred to as Left and Right.

{{dialogue|title=Left|{{gossip|What did you do today?}}

Let's see... I went to Leeroy's Chicken early in the morning, then I interrogated potential witnesses. This [[Addie Fizzlebog|Addie]] girl seemed to be a keen hunter, but she hadn't seen our criminal.

I knew there had to be a solution, so I wandered over here to think.}}

{{dialogue|title=Right|{{gossip|What did you do today?}}

Let's see... I went to Leeroy's Chicken for lunch, then I interrogated potential witnesses. Obviously, I asked the most famous hunter of all, [[Hemet Nesingwary]]. Alas, no luck.

Without leads, I wandered over here.}}

Each detective grants 20 points of progress. They mentioned names, so check in with them:

{{dialogue|title=[[Hemet Nesingwary|Hemet Nesingwary Sr.]]|{{gossip|Did you talk to Detective Jones today?}}

Aye, he asked me about any crimes I might'a seen. I talked fer a while about huntin' and spottin' prey, and that detective was a mighty fine listener. 

But nae, I haven't seen any criminals skulking about.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Addie Fizzlebog]]|{{gossip|Did you talk to Detective Jones today?}}

Yeah, sure did! Well, he tried to ask me questions. I could hardly get a word in edge-wise. 

He ended up talking about himself!}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Leeroy Jenkins]]|{{gossip|Did you talk to Detective Jones today?}}

That guy? Get this--he comes in early in the morning, orders a chicken. Sure.

Then he's back at lunch. I asked him if he wants the same thing, and he's all, "Um, uh, what?" Guy stutters for a minute and then changes his mind and walks away.

<Leeroy shrugs.>

So are you going to get a chicken or what?}}

The other three fill the bar, so return to the detectives. For the purposes of quest progression, it does not matter which detective is accused, but Right is clearly the shapeshifter.

{{dialogue|{{gossip|You're the shapeshifter!}}}}

This pops up a confirmation window:
{{dialogue|Are you sure?}}

If Left was chosen:
:{{Text|say|Athelton Jones|Poppycock! It's clearly this one!}}
:''Left points at Right.''

If Right was chosen:
:''Right shapeshifts to a [[Julia Henning|human female]] before revealing his true form of a [[satyr]] before running off. Left runs off after.''
:{{text|say|Athelton Jones|Me? How dare you!}}
:{{text|say|Athelton Jones|Fine, it was me! Herrkrop and his sorry lot killed my allies. So I killed him and pinned it on Scrapes!}}
:''[[Rexxar]] walks up and [[Spirit (hawk)|Spirit]] flies in.''
:{{text|say|Athelton Jones|And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddlesome lot and your stupid hawk!}}
:''As the satyr and the detective run off, Rexxar takes Left's place and Spirit settles down on the rock between them.''

{{dialogue|title=Rexxar|Prepare yourself for the hunt.}}

Check back in with Maru:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|{{text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain your primary case to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

Tat shapeshifter ran off? I fink it's time to get out your idol and follow the footprints in the sand!}}

[[File:Spot the Difference - Y'lliya from a distance.jpg|thumb|Y'lliya channeling a huge orb]]
Don't follow the long, glowy trail, as that leads to [[Gadgetzan]], but instead follow the smaller [[Hoofprints (Anniversary)|Hoofprints]] doodads. The trail eventually leads to a sandy nook along the northeastern edge of the [[Gaping Chasm]]. The detective has caught up and is cowering in fear:

{{dialogue|title=Athelton Jones|Okay, fine! Your help is appreciated! Is it safe to come out yet?}}

Aggro [[Y'lliya Xennin]]:
:{{text|say|Y'lliya Xennin|Let me show you what happens to heroes.}}

Finish it off:
:{{text|say|Athelton Jones|We did it? We did it!}}
:{{text|say|Athelton Jones|That's one more case solved by Athelton Jones, Detective Extraordinaire!}}
:''Jones walks away.''
