==Objectives==
Talk to [[Zeke Bootscuff]] at [[Bootlegger Outpost]].

==Description==
Well gosh, we've cleaned up quite a bit here!

Listen, , I'm looking forward to finally vacating this killbox so I can get away from these goblins and drop the cheer-act. If you'd like to continue to advance the interests of Gnomeregan, and by extension the Alliance, in the area, head south to Bootlegger Outpost.

Talk to Zeke Bootscuff there, and remember that any work for the Steamwheedle will help us shut the Bilgewater out of Tanaris for good.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|1700}} (+{{coppercost|840}} at max level)

==Completion==
You know, I'm usually not impressed when I see a <race>, but I've heard about what you've been doin' for the Steamwheedle. You're alright, kid.
