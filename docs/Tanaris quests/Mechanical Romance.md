==Objectives==
Find a use for the Guided Buoyancy Accelerant
*[[Guided Buoyancy Accelerant]] (provided)

==Description==
You wonder why this mech was crashed here, and what this liquid is for. Maybe you can use it to reach the nearby islands and oil rig that seem to be connected to this mysterious [[organization]]. If there's one thing you know, it's that magical potions taste pretty good.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||90}}
*6600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Reaching the oil rig, you spot a man in a lab coat tinkering with some robots. He notices you and shouts out while still fiddling with controls. "Fantastic! You're just in time. I've been expecting you. You're the one who drank my wonderful potion, right? I'm Dr. Jurgens, and I have a proposition for you."

==Notes==
The oil rig is located between the two [[South Seas islands]], far to the south of Tanaris. Getting there without dying in the [[fatigue]] zone requires at least a swim speed potion (such as the provided Guided Buoyancy Accelerant), though a means of water walking is also useful.

==Progression==
{{Rift Away}}
