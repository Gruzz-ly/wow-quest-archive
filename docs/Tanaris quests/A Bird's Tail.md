'''A Bird's Tail''' concludes the sixth hidden local story of [[Guest Relations]], started on 15 November and required for [[Assistant to the Assistant Guest Relations Manager]].

==Objectives==
Learn about [[Percy]]'s adventures by finding his feathers.
* Ask [[Maru]] for a hint (Optional)
* Clues found (0/100%)
*Return to Reshad outside the Caverns of Time near the stage.
* [[Decorated Feather]] (provided)

==Description==
I've told many tales in my days, but my companion Percy has a tale of his own to tell. Would you care to learn about it?

I will give you a clue on where to start. From there, you must find the clues that Percy has left behind to discover his story.

You can have this feather that Percy left behind as well. Look closely and you may find more clues. Perhaps a [[Idol of Ohn'ahra|bird of your own]] may help you on your journey.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 5x [[Bronze Celebration Token]]

==Progress==
Have you discovered Percy's tale?

==Completion==
Ah, you have returned. Let me see the clues you found...

My, what a busy bird. Percy arrived at Frostfire Ridge from a ship, where you found one of his feathers.

Next, he traveled through Nagrand to Shattrath City, where it appears he may have faced some conflict!

And finally he arrived at the Spires of Arak, where he met up with me. What an adventure for our friend!

==Notes==
<onlyinclude>Reshad heads over the [[Decorated Feather]], which has the flavor text "This feather has been decorated with ancient Arakkoa beading. It appears to have fallen from a great height as some of the beads have shattered."

Speak with Reshad again:
{{dialogue|The clue is this: The winds whisper secrets, high above the ground. Seek the feather where the Arakkoa once soared.}}

Also check in with [[Maru]]:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|{{text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain the case of A Bird's Tail to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

Arakkoa? I heard they would fly around the [[Spires of Arak]].

Try looking in high places there wiff your idol!}}

[[Spires of Arak]] is on {{Au|Draenor}}, so the fastest way there is the [[Garrison Hearthstone]] or the portals to [[Stormshield]] or [[Warspear]]. A good high place to check would be [[Windswept Terrace]] in the southwest, where a [[Burnt Feather]] turns up at {{co|45.7|53.6|Spires of Arak}} in the [[Alignment Controls]]. It has the flavor text "The feather looks battle-worn, burnt, torn in areas, and a strange green liquid is dripping off the end of it." Pick it up for 25% progress, then check in with Maru:

{{dialogue|Eww, what's tat dripping off da feather?

Looks like it was in a battle. Hmm... Wasn't there a big battle at a city in Draenor?}}

A big city with strange green (fel?) liquid would be the [[Shattrath Overlook]] of {{au|Shattrath City}} in northwest [[Talador]]. Find a [[Plucked Feather (Anniversary)]] and some [[Torn Scroll (Talador)|Torn Scrolls]] at {{co|29.6|29.5|Talador}} on a rock by the lake. The feather has the flavor text of "The feather appears to have been purposely plucked and altered to be missing exactly 48 barbs on the left and has a remaining 93 barbs on the right."

Maru has advice too:
{{dialogue|Tat feather looks plucked on purpose...

Maybe the number of tiny feathers left can help? Look reeaally closely at the feathers. I bet da finking cap can help!

I fink the left number will be negative and the right number will be positive. Make sure you start from where you found the previous clue! You saw a bunch of scrolls near it, right?}}

Bring out the [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] and head to (-48, 93) or {{co|83.8|19.4|Nagrand (alternate universe)}} on the {{au|Elemental Plateau}} of {{au|Nagrand}}. The [[Frozen Feather]] is on top of the mountain, with flavor text of "The feather is frozen and has a strange combination of scents: volcanic ash, saltwater, and engine oil."

Maru, as always, has a pointer:
{{dialogue|Ohh, this feather definitely came from somewhere freezing.

And tat smell... What cold place would have a combination of all of these smells? Maybe somewhere wiff a ship?}}

Somewhere with a ship in [[Frostfire Ridge]] is the [[Frostwall Shipyard]], the Horde [[Garrison]]. At {{co|42.1|67.5|Frostfire Ridge}} find the [[Normal Feather]], with flavor text "The feather appears unaltered as expected at the start of a journey."

The Normal Feather was initially out of phase for Horde players who had built their shipyard. It was recommended to use party sync with a player who had not built their shipyard or to try flying at the feather and spamming the interact key.

This completes the objective, so return to Reshad.
