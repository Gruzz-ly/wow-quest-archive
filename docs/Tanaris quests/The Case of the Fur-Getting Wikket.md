==Notes==
<onlyinclude>Riko hands over [[My Journal: The Case of the Fur-Getting Wikket]]. It initially reads:
{{Book|content=
Riko wants me to find a pet for him and Kiryn. I should ask them both what kind of pet they want.
}}

Maru offers a hint:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|{{Text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain the case of the Fur-Getting Wikket to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

Hmmm, have you tried asking around? Talk to Riko and Kiryn to figure out what pet they both want, and then look around for clues! Maybe da pet lady [[Breanni]] knows somefing.
}}

Speak with Riko and Kiryn. The journal updates after speaking with both.

{{Dialogue|title=Riko|
{{Gossip|What kind of pet do you want?}}

Riko wants something cute, like those wikkin' bandit weasels that eat trash.
}}

{{Book|content=
Riko wants something cute like a raccoon. I wonder if anyone around here has seen a raccoon.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Kiryn|
{{Gossip|What kind of pet do you want?}}

I think something that doesn't need to be fed would be ideal. Living creatures have so many needs.
}}

{{Book|content=
Kiryn wants something undead.
}}

[[File:The Case of the Fur-Getting Wikket - Kieule and Breanni.jpg|thumb|[[Kieule]] and [[Breanni]]]]
Riko and Kiryn's gossip each add 20% progress. [[Petra]] the pet greeter can be found just below the pair:

{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|I'm looking for a pet.}}

Breanni would be more than happy to help you find a good pet!
}}

Follow Maru and Petra's advice and speak with Breanni in the stall at {{co|62.35|49.92|Tanaris}} in the battle pet area:

{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|I'm looking for a pet.}}

I've got all kinds! What are you looking for?

{{Gossip|Bird of Prey / Cat / Dog / Mechanical / Raptor / Serpent / Spider}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I think I have something like that. Check it out!
}}

{{Gossip|Dead / Raccoon}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Hmm... I know [[Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Sully McLeary]] used to have a couple of raccoons, but they passed away.
}}}}

[[File:The Case of the Fur-Getting Wikket - Sully.jpg|thumb|[[Sully "The Pickle" McLeary]]]]
Choosing either Dead or Racoon advances the quest. Head over to Sully "The Pickle" McLeary at {{Co|63.05|49.42|Tanaris}} near the Photo Booth. Before talking to him, rumage through the nearby [[Trash Pile]]:

:{{Text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Gizmo used tae love rummagin' through trash piles just like that...}}

Speak with Sully:

{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|I'm looking for a pet.}}

<Sully begins to sob.>

[[Socks|SOCKS]]! [[Gizmo (raccoon)|GIZMO]]! Ach, they were taken too soon.

{{Gossip|Where are they now?}}

It's been so long... I remember looking fer a place tae give 'em a proper burial.

I was at the [[Serpent's Heart]] when I headed west on my [[gryphon]], 'cross a stone bridge and turned to follow a path. I dinnae remember what happened next, was just flyin' through the tears. But it can't have been more than ten paces east an' forty south.

I remember the watchers and I held a torchlight vigil, overlooking a blossoming orchard. In the glow o' the light, we could feel their presence with us still.
}}

[[File:The Case of the Fur-Getting Wikket - stone bridge at Serpent's Heart.jpg|thumb|The stone bridge west of [[Serpent's Heart]]]]
This gets to 60% progress, and the journal gets an update:
{{Book|content=
Sully says he buried Gizmo and Socks near Serpent's Heart. He flew west across a stone bridge with his gryphon. Then he turned onto a path and flew no more than ten paces east and forty south. There he held a torchlight vigil with the watchers while overlooking a blossoming orchard. The glow of the light summoned their presence.
}}

As does Maru:
{{Dialogue|
We need to follow in Sully's footsteps! His directions seem to lead to da [[Serpent's Overlook]].
}}

[[File:The Case of the Fur-Getting Wikket - Serpent's Overlook graves.jpg|thumb|Grave markers at [[Serpent's Overlook]]]]
Head to the [[Jade Forest]] via portals in [[Orgrimmar]] or [[Stormwind City]] and fly to [[Serpent's Heart]] near the center of the zone. The stone bridge Sully mentions is at {{co|42.5|60.2|Jade Forest}} over the [[Slicky Stream]]. Equip the [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] to reset it to (0, 0) and head in the direction of (10, -40) or {{co|43.4|68.8|Jade Forest}} to reach [[Serpent's Overlook]]. Bring the [[Idol of Ohn'ahra]] online to find two grave markers at {{Co|43.40|68.69|Jade Forest}} near [[Sky Dancer Ji]], and burn the right-hand marker  with the [[Torch of Pyrreth]]:
:{{Text|emote|Gizmo emerges from the grave and flees!}}

This advances the quest to 80% and updates the journal:
{{Book|content=
When the torch light hit Gizmo's grave, the undead Gizmo emerged and fled somewhere nearby. I should try to catch him.
}}

And Maru offers a hint:
{{Dialogue|
And then Gizmo showed up and ran away? Wowie! You gotta catch him!

Maybe be reeeally sneaky-like and you won't spoop him.
}}

[[File:The Case of the Fur-Getting Wikket - Gizmo.jpg|thumb|[[Gizmo (raccoon)|Gizmo]]]]
The undead Gizmo runs away! He is very skittish:
:{{Abilities|Skittish|id=469903|Gizmo is easily startled by sudden movement.|icon=inv_pineconecritter_white}}

Toggle run/walk (with the default hotkey of {{keypress|Num Pad /}}), then follow and slooowly catch up to the undead racoon, who never hurt anyone. Consider targeting Gizmo with <code>/tar Gizmo</code>, then placing a [[Target marker]] over his head to make the search easier. [[Druid]]s can simply switch to [[Steady Flight]] and catch the raccoon in [[Flight Form]].

[[File:The Case of the Fur-Getting Wikket - after.jpg|thumb|Sully, Kiryn, Riko, and Gizmo]]
After catching [[Gizmo (quest item)]], return to Riko. On complete:
:{{text|say|Shademaster Kiryn|It's adorable!}}
:{{text|yell|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Gizmo? Is that you?}}
:{{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Gizmo? I've missed ye so much!}}
:{{text|say|Sully "The Pickle" McLeary|Eauchh! What in all the forges is that stench?}}
:{{text|say|Riko|He's jeekin' dead, you tik-nooker!}}
:{{text|say|Riko|Here stinky fur-friend, come to Riko.}}

Five minutes after completing the quest, players receive mail from Riko:

{{book|Fur-having STINKS|content=Kiryn likes bandit friend, but Riko thinks he smells like ikkin' dook.

Maybe you borrow furry-friend on your adventures sometimes. Get smell away from Riko. Bring him back before Kiryn notices or wikket will get grooked in the dooker.}}

Attached is [[Gizmo the Pure]].</onlyinclude>

* In Russian version, completion phrase is localized as "Ай да шнуропс! Ай да дукин сын!" (''Ay-da shnurops! Ay-da dukin syn!''), which is wordplay with the Russian catchphrase "{{wp|What a Pushkin, what a son of a bitch!|Ай да Пушкин, ай да сукин сын!}}" (''Ay-da Pushkin, ay-da sukin syn!'', What a Pushkin, what a son of a bitch!) from the letter of famous Russian poet and novelist {{wp|Alexander Pushkin}} to his friend, poet {{wp|Pyotr Vyazemsky}}.
