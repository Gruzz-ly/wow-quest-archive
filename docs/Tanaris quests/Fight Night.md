==Objectives==
Claim victory in the [[Thunderdrome|Gadgetzan Arena]].
*Arena Victory

==Description==
Everything's set for the grand re-opening of the Gadgetzan Arena!

The rules are simple: you'll have three fights, ending with the champ. You'll get a short break between fights, but you can't leave the arena at any point. If you do, you forfeit.

When you're ready, the fight's on!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4700 [[XP]]
*{{cost||75}}
*[[Rune of the Gladiator]]
*[[Blademaster's Fury]]

==Completion==
You really put on a show out there. I was on the edge of my seat, I tell ya! The profits weren't too shabby either.

As champ, you'll get a cut of the coin, plus a little something extra just for making all this possible. To the victor goes the spoils, as they say.
