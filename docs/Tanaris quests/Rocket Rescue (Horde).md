== Objectives ==
Deliver Life-Rockets to 5 Steamwheedle Survivors and use bombs to kill 40 Southshore Blockaders.
*Life Rockets Delivered (5)
*[[Southsea Blockader]] slain (40)

== Description ==
Alright, <name>. We've done enough small jobs around here; it's time to seal the deal.

The ruins of [[Steamwheedle Port]] are still full of hapless Steamwheedle goblins, waiting to be rescued. Every single one of them is a potential future customer. They're firing on every boat that leaves port...so I say we take to the skies!

There's a hot air balloon just outside of town near the docks, we can use that. Go ahead and hop in, I'll catch up with you.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Nasmira's Soup Stirrer|Dud Bomb|Salvaged Steamwheedle Helm|Failed Liferocket Prototype}}

You will receive:
*{{cost|1|30}}
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
What's with the premature bail-out? We gotta get back out there.

== Completion ==
Isn't it nice when you can do a good deed, and see enormous future financial gains from it? It warms my little goblin heart. And my big goblin wallet.

You did great, kid. [[Gadgetzan|Gadgetzan's]] gonna be ours soon. Here's a little token of my appreciation.
