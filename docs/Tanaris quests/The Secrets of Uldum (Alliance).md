==Objectives==
Search the Antechamber of Uldum for an intact artifact.

==Description==
I studied these ruins for years trying to find a way in. We even took a good chunk out of the gate, only to find impenetrable walls beneath. Now the Cataclysm may've wrecked everything in there something fierce, but it's done what we couldn't and opened a way in!

I'd like you to have the honor, <lad/lass>. Head on in there and see if anything's been left uncracked. Be careful though... there's no telling what, or who, might be stirring in there.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

==Completion==
This chest lies undisturbed, sealed for thousands of years.

==Progression==
{{Valley of the Watchers}}

==Notes==
When first added, this quest could not be completed because the cave was considered part of [[Uldum]], which could not be entered prior to the release of {{expac|Cataclysm}}.
