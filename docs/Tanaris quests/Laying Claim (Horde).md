== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Dwarven Archologists.
*[[Explorer's League Digger]] slain (10)

== Description ==
We are not the only ones who have discovered the value of the [[Southmoon Ruins]]. The dwarves of the [[Explorer's League]] have swarmed there, taking artifacts and inscriptions for the Alliance.

I don't think I have to explain much further. We will not allow the discoveries here to fall into the hands of the Alliance. Slay as many dwarves as you can, and drive them from the ruins!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

== Progress ==
The dwarves will not be dissuaded by weak resistance, <name>.

== Completion ==
Excellent. The less interference from the Alliance, the better.

==Progression==
{{Valley of the Watchers}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
