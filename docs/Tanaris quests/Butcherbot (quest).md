==Objectives==
Use the Butcherbot to harvest 10 [[Glasshide Basilisk]] corpses.
* Glasshide Basilisks Harvested (10)
* [[Butcherbot Control Gizmo]] (provided)

==Description==
I make my money around here selling animal parts. I've been perfecting a foolproof method of maximizing profit: The butcherbot!

These little guys are programmed to harvest every scrap of usable material from the wildlife around here, on a case-by-case basis. He does all the work, and best of all, only I know how to get the goods back out of him.

If you're interested in making some coin, take one of these guys for a spin. I need some glasshide basilisk parts; you'll find a bunch of them to the south.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

==Completion==
Nice going, kid. Didn't lose any fingers? Good, we can get some more work for you then.
