;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Alyx|Here is the note from Rexxar. He left instructions for you.}}

Speak with Maru:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|{{Text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain your primary case to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

Humm. So you've got a note from Rexxar with some coordinates. If you put on your finking cap, I'm sure you can find him!

Unless... If tat ship doesn't take you where you wanna go, you might need to find the docks on your own!

The [[Note from Rexxar]] reads:
{{:Note from Rexxar}}

Use the [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] next to Alyx to reset it to (0, 0) and head to (36, 44) or {{co|68.04|40.87|Tanaris}} to find the [[Pre-Calibrated Goblin Transport Vessel]]. Using it teleports the character to {{co|81.8|62.5|Borean Tundra}} on a small ice chunk in the [[Frozen Sea]] south of the Borean Tundra. Players are debuffed with
:{{Abilities|Washed Ashore|id=460236|This doesn't seem right...|icon=spell_frost_stun}}

Head north to the dock of Unu'pe at {{co|78.8|53.4|Borean Tundra}}, where [[Maru]] has somehow already gotten there, alongside [[Nikamik]] and [[Tuk]], then reset the thinking cap. Head to (-9, 27) or {{Co|77.3|46.2|Borean Tundra}} to find [[Rexxar]] at a small camp.
