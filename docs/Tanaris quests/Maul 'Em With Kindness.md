==Objectives==
Use the Bilgewater Cartel Promotional Delicacy Morsels on 8 [[Dunemaul clan|Dunemaul]] Ogres after weakening them.
*Ogres Fed (8)
*[[Bilgewater Cartel Promotional Delicacy Morsels]] (provided)

==Description==
Okay, babe, listen up. There's two ways to get people to do what you want. You can provide goods, services, and things people want...or you can beat the living daylights out of them.

I've often found it's useful to do both at the same time, and you're pretty familiar with both methods by now. Take these little silithid treats, go and beat some ogres dizzy, and then give them the treat before you knock them completely dead, 'kay?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||70}}
*6290 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{f|Bilgewater Cartel}}

==Completion==
Good job, you've taught half the ogres here to fear and respect anything vaguely <race>-shaped.

It's amazing what a little reward will do to keep people under your thumb, isn't it? Here's your payment, by the way.

...what's with that look?
