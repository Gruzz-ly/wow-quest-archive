== Objectives ==
Search the Antechamber of Uldum for an intact artifact.
*Search the Antechamber of Uldum for an intact artifact.

== Description ==
We are ready to enter the antechamber itself, <name>. This is a momentous occasion.

From the writings you've brought us, I believe these ruins were in fact once the grand entrance to [[Uldum]] itself. The quakes that ripped its doors open have probably collapsed the tunnels, but we may yet find amazing things hidden within.

Search the ruins for anything intact that may be studied. The thrill of discovery awaits!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

== Completion ==
The chest lies undisturbed, sealed for thousands of years.

==Progression==
{{Valley of the Watchers}}

==Notes==
When first added, this quest could not be completed because the cave was considered part of [[Uldum]], which could not be entered prior to the release of {{expac|Cataclysm}}.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Hotfix|date=2010-11-30|bluenote=This quest can now be completed.}}
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
