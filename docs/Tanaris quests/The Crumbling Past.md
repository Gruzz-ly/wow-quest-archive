== Objectives ==
Collect 5 Earthen Jewels.
* [[Earthen Jewel]] (5)

== Description ==
The creatures wandering these ruins are [[Earthen]], the ancient ancestors of dwarves, made by the [[Titan]]s to shape the world itself.

The original Earthen broke down and went awry thousands of years ago, and these freshly uncovered ones seem no difference. We may as well make use of these confused and unstable constructs.

Enter the ruins and destroy the Earthen, and collect the jewels embedded in them; their magical energies will be both valuable and worthy of study.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||70}}

== Progress ==
Handle those carefully, <name>; they are as ancient as the world itself.

== Completion ==
Marvelous. To think the shapers of our world crafted these...

==Progression==
{{Valley of the Watchers}}

== Patch changes ==
