== Objectives ==
Destroy 6 Sandstone Golems.
*[[Sandstone Golem]] slain (6)

== Description ==
For years, [[Valley of the Watchers|this valley]] have been sealed behind an impenetrable gate. Now that the [[cataclysm]] has torn them down, the secrets within are ours to discover.

There are yet some obstacles in the way. From within the gates, the bygone creations of the titans have awoken. They wander aimlessly across the sand, attacking any who approach.

Someone needs to destroy the golems patrolling the valley; are you up to it?

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gatewatcher Belt
|Examiner's Monnions
|Sandstone Pauldrons}}

== Progress ==
Too many golems still wander the sand, <name>.

== Completion ==
Thank you, <class>. We would be hard pressed to face such enemies without your assistance.
