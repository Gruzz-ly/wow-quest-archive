==Objectives==
Travel into the [[Sunken Temple (Season of Discovery)|Sunken Temple]] and discover the secret hidden in the circle of statues.

==Description==
My memories are cloudy, but I will tell you what I can. The circle of statues in the Sunken Temple, while dangerous, I believe that they hold the secret to unlock an even greater treasure.

From the main altar, I was able to activate a series of lights. I think that if you can uncover what these lights mean, you might be able to unlock whatever secrets are hiding in this room.

I warn you though, <name>. Great evil lies in the temple. It's likely that anything valuable will be fervently guarded...

==Rewards==
*[[Hakkari Urn]] which contains:
**[[Hakkari Shroud (Season of Discovery)]]
**[[Hakkari Breastplate (Season of Discovery)]]
**[[Mark of Hakkar (Season of Discovery)]]

==Completion==
The eye of the idol glitters brightly even in the half-darkness of the temple. Its transparency reveals something shiny behind it. Sliding it to the side, you reach in and grasp what lies inside the statue.

The Atal'ai treasure is now yours.

==Notes==
*You need to click on the serpent statues in a specific order.
#South
#North
#Southwest
#Southeast
#Northwest
#Northeast
*After you clicked on the statues in the correct order, a big altar will appear in the water below along with a miniboss guardian. Kill the miniboss and then click on the altar to get your reward.
