==Objectives==
Kill 15 Hazzali Silithid of any kind in the Gaping Chasm.
*Hazzali Silithid slain (15)

==Description==
I've spent the last week starin' at this ugly pit trying to think of how to exploit a bunch of dangerous, violent arthropods for profit. Now I'm out of ideas, and starving.

These things are a wash, and I say it's time to start clearing them out. Head down into that pit and start killin' bugs.

You will receive: {{coppercost|7000}} (+{{coppercost|3600}} at max level)

==Completion==
This isn't goin' fast enough. There's gotta be a faster way...
