==Objectives==
Talk to [[Zeke Bootscuff]] at [[Bootlegger Outpost]].

==Description==
We've done a bang up job here. I'm gonna make sure these mooks finish properly and then head back to [[Gadgetzan]] for a bit.

If you want to keep making a good impression on our [[Steamwheedle Cartel|Steamwheedle]] friends, or just make more money, you should head southwest of here. Bootlegger Outpost is set up on the edge of the gaping chasm.

Talk to Zeke Bootscuff. I'd bet good money he'll need help.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

==Completion==
You're with [[Megs Dreadshredder|Megs]], huh? Word is she's been pretty hell-bent on making nice with [[Marin Noggenfogger|Noggenfogger]].

Not like I care. Are you ready to kill some bugs?
