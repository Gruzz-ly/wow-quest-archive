==Objectives==
Defeat [[Megs Dreadshredder]].
*Megs Dreadshredder Defeated
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
It seems we have a special request! I have here a note from one Kelsey Steelspark, requesting to enter the cage and settle a dispute.

She's asked for you to be her partner, <name>. A fan of your previous victories? Or perhaps you're acquainted outside the ring?

I wouldn't back down now if I were you. This is the grand finale...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Thunderdrome Ring
|Kelsey's Necklace
|Dreadshredder Cloak
}}

You will also receive: {{coppercost|21000}} (+{{coppercost|5850}} at max level)

==Progress==
Stop wasting my time. Enter and fight!

==Completion==
Fantastic. I might challenge you to a duel myself someday.

==Notes==
:{{text|say|Dr. Dealwell|Into the Thunderdrome, <name>!  There's no getting out until someone's hit the sand.  Let's start the show!}}
:{{text|say|Megs Dreadshredder|You've gotten in my way one too many times, gnome.}}
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|You have fully depleted my patience as well.}}
:{{text|say|Megs Dreadshredder|There isn't room in this town for both of us!}}
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|I will attemt to no take undue pleasure in utterly destroying you.}}
:{{text|yell|Megs Dreadshredder|BRING IT, PIPSQUEAK!}}
:{{text|yell|Megs Dreadshredder|You think you're clever, don't you, ganging up on me like this... well, prepare to face: THE DREADSHREDDER!}}
:{{text|yell|Megs Dreadshredder|You think you're all brave facing me, eh, Steelsparks?! Those pig tails won't protect you from THE DOOMSAW!}}
:{{text|yell|Kelsey Steelspark|Ack! Not the face!}}
:{{text|yell|Kelsey Steelspark|Whaaaa!!!!!}}

Kelsey Steelspark starts running around the arena, being chased by Megs and a pair of sawblades from the shredder.
Upon killing the shredder, both Kelsey and Megs return to the center of the arena and Kelsey says the following:
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|You can be sure to tell Gallywix not to underestimate Gnomeregan anymore.}} 
:{{text|say|Kelsey Steelspark|Until next time, Megs. Don't forget today's lesson.}}

At this point, Dr. Dealwell yells the following:
:{{text|yell|Dr. Dealwell|And that's that, folks! This conflict's been settled the proper way, with VIOLENCE!  Let's hear it for our contestants!}}

A couple of seconds later he also yells one of the following as a random final yell (they are actually used upon player death inside the arena, it seems to be a bug)
:{{text|yell|Dr. Dealwell|They went down like a sack of orc skulls!}}
:{{text|yell|Dr. Dealwell|OOOF! That one's gonna require the "scraper."}}
:{{text|yell|Dr. Dealwell|The challenger has been defeated!}}
:{{text|yell|Dr. Dealwell|All that's left of the challenger is a red stain on the floor!}}
:{{text|yell|Dr. Dealwell|Avert your eyes, ladies and gentlemen! It's a bloodbath!}}
:{{text|yell|Dr. Dealwell|OUTTA NOWHERE -- WHAMO! DEAD!}}
