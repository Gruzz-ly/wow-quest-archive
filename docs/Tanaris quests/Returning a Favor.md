==Objectives==
Find [[Megs Dreadshredder]] at the [[Dunemaul Camp]].

==Description==
You know, while you were out doin' your thing, Megs stopped by here. I hadn't seen her in months, but she barely gave me the time of day, just wanted me to tell you she had more business lined up.

She said she was headed over to the Dunemaul Compound to set up shop, something about ogres. Since you're done here, might as well head over...I woundn't keep a goblin like her waiting.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

==Completion==
I've got a great one for you this time, <name>. We're gonna initiate these ogres into the Horde...working directly under us.

==Progression==
