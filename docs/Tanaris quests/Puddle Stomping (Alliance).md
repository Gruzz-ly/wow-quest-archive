==Objectives==
Kill 8 [[Tidal Strider]]s.

==Description==
There's a big problem here! It's great that the ocean came in so far, because now ships can get to Gadgetzan. But now there's a bunch of nasty old [[sea giant]]s encroaching on the town! I'm sure Mister Noggenfogger would appreciate us taking care of them for him.

Don't worry, I won't ask you to do it just out of the goodness of your heart! Take care of them and I'll give you a reward!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|6500}} (+{{coppercost|3300}} at max level)

==Completion==
Oh, it's going to be so much nicer around here now that they're gone!

At least until more show up. But thank you!
