==Objectives==
Rewind time and defend [[Moraidormi]] from Vexemia's attack.
* [[Time]] reversed
* [[Vexemia]] confronted

==Description==
Do you not agree that Moraidormi can be saved? We [[Infinite dragonflight|infinites]] often save those we think suffered needlessly--worthy or not.

Supposedly, Mori died too close to the [[Caverns of Time]] just east of us. Using too much [[time]] [[magic]] here could have... consequences.

But this should be quick. [[Chrono-Lord Deios]] was in possession of artifacts that could forcefully rewind time. The [[bronze dragonflight]] has them now.

We will rewind time and then destroy Vexemia. Simple.

Simple.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
This will be easy. Which makes one wonder why the bronze dragonflight did not do it before!

==Completion==
That... did not go as I had planned.

But I will not give up! We can just rewind again until we get it right.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Eternus|[[Nozdormu]], you can easily rewind time, can you not?}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Yes, though I will use the Chrono-Lord's artifact to reduce the pressure on the timeline. Join me, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|These sands will protect you from the forced rewind.}}

At the beginning, Nozdormu has new gossip options:
:{{Gossip|Isn't rewinding a bad idea?}}
::An overuse of rewinding can cause the timeline to corrode, which could create dust, fractures, elementals--or worse.

::My interference could cause even greater impact. I will assist in these rewinds of time to allow Eternus some resolution. 

::Within limits.

::{{Gossip|Good to keep in mind.}}

:{{Gossip|Can you tell me more about the artifact we got from Chrono-Lord Deios?}}
::The artifact has the ability to force time into retreat for a very short time, with few side effects.

::Few, but not zero, side effects.

::{{Gossip|Thank you for explaining.}}

Stand at the spot between Eternus and Nozdormu and use the extra action button:
:{{Abilities|Rewind Time|id=415562|Enough to fix one mistake...|icon=ability_evoker_rewind}}
:''The previous scene plays in reverse: Vexemia walks in, breath-attacks Moraidormi, who revives, then Vexemia moonwalks out.''
:{{text|yell|Vexemia|You cannot hide from me, little dragon!}}
:''Eternus stealths over to get behind Moraidormi.''
:{{text|say|Eternus|I will get into position.}}
:{{text|say|Vexemia|Ah, so you choose to die fighting? Good for you, I guess!}}
:{{text|say|Moraidormi|Sister? You're here! What is going on?}}
:{{text|say|Vexemia|Enough talk. Die, weaklings!}}
:''Eternus shifts out of her visage into her dragon form.''
:{{text|say|Eternus|I will explain later. We are here to help.}}
:{{text|say|Moraidormi|This <class> is with you? Please, aid me!}}
:{{text|yell|Eternus|Defend her!}}

Before joining the fight, note that Nozdormu has dropped into stealth:

{{book|content=
I would like to help Eternus if we can.

{{gossip|Why are you hidden from view?}}

I am willing to see what Eternus has in mind, but I do not intend to directly change events.

My instinct--and my visions--stay my hand.

{{gossip|Thank you for explaining.}}
}}

Join the fray and knock Vexemia from 80% to 50%. At 50%:
:{{text|yell|Vexemia|I have allies as well! Assist me, my brood!}}
:''A couple of [[Black Dragon (Tanaris)|Black Dragons]], also afflicted by Deathwing's Influence, fly in to attack, using their flame breath to kill Moraidormi.''
:{{text|yell|Eternus|No! How is the outcome the same? I must reset. I am pausing time again!}}

==Progression==
{{No Limits}}
