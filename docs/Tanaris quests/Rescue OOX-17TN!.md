This quest involves one of {{questchain|Oglethorpe's Homing Robots}} and is a prerequisite for [[An OOX of Your Own]].

== Objectives ==
Escort OOX-17/TN to safety, then report to [[Oglethorpe Obnoticus]] in [[Booty Bay]].
*Escort OOX-17/TN to Caverns of Time

== Description ==
The [[gnome]]'s voice crackles once again from the robot:

"I need to move OOX-17/TN to an open, safe place so it can begin a lengthy take-off procedure.  It has built-in cloaking, but I need time on my end to make it operational again.  I need you to escort the robot from its current location to, let's say, near the [[Caverns of Time]]!  That should be a perfect place, and long enough, to get things on line!"

"Escort it safely and then come talk to me in Booty Bay!  Oglethorpe Obnoticus - out!"

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Optomatic Deflector]]
*[[Thermotastic Egg Timer]]

You will also receive:
*6300 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Booty Bay]]
*-350 [[reputation]] with [[Bloodsail Buccaneers]]

==Progress==
Yes, I'm Oglethorpe Obnoticus, master inventor at your service! Now, is there something I could assist you with?

== Completion ==
Oh, YOU'RE the great savior of OOX-17/TN! &nbsp;I cannot even begin to express my thanks for your assistance! &nbsp;My homing robot series needs more developing, but your recovery has saved me countless hours of rebuilding time, as well as many gold pieces in rebinding costs!

Please, take your choice of any of these items I have. &nbsp;Hopefully, you will make good use of one of them. &nbsp;Thank you again for your generous assistance, my robots and I are in your debt! 

== Notes ==
As of patch 3.2.0, you will be ambushed only once while escorting the homing robot.  This will be by three scorpions, between two small mounds of dirt.

The later ambush has been removed.  

The chicken will only stop if it is attacked, or it notices you are in combat.  If you aggro an ambush at range, the chicken and the ambushers may well pass each other without stopping.  If this happens, you can drag the ambushers back to the chicken and fight there.  The chicken will soon catch on.

The chicken will also aggro mobs along its path.

It is also possible to encounter the mobs from a previous attempt to complete this quest.  These should probably be killed, if possible, before starting the quest.

This quest is not impossible solo at the appropriate level, but having a friend along is recommended.
