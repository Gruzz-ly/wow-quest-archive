==Objectives==
Collect 20 Gold Fillings from [[Southsea Musketeer]]s or [[Southsea Strongarm]]s.
*[[Gold Filling]] (20)

==Description==
I know we're here to make friends with the Steamwheedle goblins, but those awful Bilgewater goblins are so rude

Why, I just saw a bunch of them pulling gold fillings out of the teeth of the Southsea musketeers and strongarms. Do they think they can just take that for themselves?

Obviously, the nice thing to do is kill those pirates ourselves, take their fillings ourselves, and then give some of them to the Steamwheedle as a thank-you gift! Head on down there and beat those goblins to the punch.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||65}}

==Progress==
Have you got the fillings?

==Completion==
More gold! We'll be sure to give some of this to Mister Noggenfogger to smoothly ensure our continued relations.

And only a little bit of it will go back to Gnomeregan for experimental weapons development!
