== Objectives ==
Kill Captain Dreadbeard.
*[[Captain Dreadbeard]] slain

== Description ==
Alright, babe, I've got something bigger for you to take on here.

We spotted the captain of the Southsea over on one of his boats to the south; that's to the south, and NOT the one we've been suicidally bum-rushing for the better part of several hours. He's sitting up there, smug and stoic, watching us war down here.

I'll spare you the "hostile takeover" jokes. Get on his ship and beat the tar out of him, and we're done here!

== Completion ==
Sea giants? You think he was training them towards Gadgetzan on purpose?

Whatever, he's splitsville now. And Gadgetzan owes us big time! I can't wait to see the look on Marin's face.

Here's your cut, babe. You're moving up in the world.
