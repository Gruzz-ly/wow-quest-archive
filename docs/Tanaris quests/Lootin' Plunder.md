==Objectives==
Collect 10 pieces of Pirate Loot.
*[[Pirate Booty]] (10)

==Description==
It's just really so wasteful that all these [[pirate]]s have golden treasures laying around. Some of this stuff could be used for practical things! Like melting into wire, or intrinsic shielding matrices, or selling to other stupid races that buy gold just to keep it around.

And speaking of other stupid races, I bet those greedy [[goblin]]s are going to be taking all of it. We can't let that happen! Go collect that treasure for [[Gnomeregan (kingdom)|Gnomeregan]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||65}}
*5790 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
I hope you don't think you're hiding any for yourself, silly! These goggles can see right through your bags.

And your armor.

==Completion==
Fantastic! Gosh, this will make enough wire for an entire army.

Lucky us!

==Progression==
