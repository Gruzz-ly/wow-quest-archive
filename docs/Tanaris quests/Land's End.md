==Objectives==
Talk to [[Kelsey Steelspark]] at [[Steelspark Station]].

==Description==
Psst! Hey! Come closer, you fool, you expect me to read your mind or--oh. Come closer anyway!

You've done a wonderful job advancing the agenda of [[Gnomeregan]] here, friend! And an amazing job of pretending you were only in it for the coin, simply splendid. But now Kelsey Steelspark could use more of your direct help.

She's moved on yet again...she asked me to tell you to meet her far south, at [[Land's End Beach]]. I wouldn't keep her waiting, either!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|3500}} (+{{coppercost|1800}} at max level)

==Completion==
I'm amazed that Soothfancy was capable of following a simple set of instructions. And ones that required him to keep his foolish mouth silenced as well.

In addition, it is honestly good to see you again, <name>. Now that I've dropped the charade, you'll get to see how gnomes get things done around here. 

==Progression==
This optional breadcrumb becomes available after competing [[Just Trying to Kill Some Bugs]], which ends the "Bug Free" quest chain at [[Bootlegger Outpost]].
