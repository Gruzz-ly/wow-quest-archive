==Objectives==
Find the pamphlet's originator.
*[[Weathered Pamphlet]]

==Description==
<This pamphlet appears to be a mass-produced flier advertising an [[:Azerite]]-buying service.

You can make out a few faded but colorful phrases like "Your fortune awaits in the [[Great Sea]]!" and "Everyone's getting rich, isn't it your time?" 

There is no mention of any of the dangers involved.

There is some information about who to contact at the bottom, however.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (700x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Are you here about the pamphlet? 

What's wrong, expecting someone greener? Listen, we've all got to eat. I've got a family at home, and this war's taking all of the food away.

Not my problem if some amateur adventurers with gold in their eyes get in a little trouble? That sounds more like your problem.

Now if you're not going to sell me your Azerite, buzz off. [[Jastor Gallywix|Big G]] doesn't like it when I talk too much.

Uh, did I say G? Pretend I didn't.

Here, just take some of my Azerite and keep quiet, ok?
