== Objectives ==
Kill the Southsea Taskmaster.
*[[Southsea Taskmaster]] slain

== Description ==
As you may have seen, the ship docked to the north has its cannons blazing. While it's pretty fun watching the gnomes run face-first into a hail of iron, my [[bruiser]]s keep doing it too, and it's absolutely killing my overhead expenses.

I'd like you to try and dance through the cannonfire, get on that ship, and kill the taskmaster leading the [[Southsea Cannoneer|cannoneers]]. The rest of the crew is probably a bunch of spineless prats; once he's down, we should be good.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||65}}
*5790 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Bilgewater Cartel}}

== Completion ==
Nice work, kid. Any close calls? Did you get grazed?

No? Good, because we've got more fish to fry here.

==Progression==
{{Lost Rigger Cove}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
