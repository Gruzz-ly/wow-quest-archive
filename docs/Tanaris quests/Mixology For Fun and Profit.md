==Objectives==
Bring [[Mixmaster Blix]] 10 Invisibility Potions, 10 Elixir of Demonslaying, and 5 Elixir of Sages.
*[[Elixir of Demonslaying]] (10)
*[[Invisibility Potion]] (10)
*[[Elixir of the Sages]] (5)

==Description==
Any [[alchemist]] worth their salt will tell you that the art is all about maximizing profit margins. It's all about soucring materials cheap, crafting in bulk, and selling sky high. What if I told you there was a way to make your materials go much, much further? Well, as the self-proclaimed "Master of Mixology" I've got just what you need if you want to level up your elixir and potion game. Bring me 10 Invisibility Potions, 10 Elixirs of Demonslaying, and 5 Elixir of Sages and I'll show you the ropes.

==Progress==
Look I've got a lot of potential students waiting around to learn from me. Do you have what I asked for? If not, beat it.

==Completion==
Oh wow you actually brought that stuff? Well, alright then. Let's cook that noodle of yours and make you a proper mixologist.
