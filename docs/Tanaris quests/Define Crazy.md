==Objectives==
Kill 10 Crazed Survivors.
*[[Crazed Bilgewater Survivor]] slain (10)

==Description==
We received reports that a [[goblin]] shipwreck occured{{sic}} on this beach some time ago, with the survivors left to fend for themselves. We expected there to be a modicum of survivors, perhaps some even suitable for interrogation.

What we found was a crew of [[Bilgewater Cartel|Bilgewater]] goblins who have all become insane, delusional, and maniacally violent...to further degrees than is normally observed, rather.

In short, they are useless and dangerous. [[Gnomeregan]] will be best served by cutting down as many as we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|7000}} (+{{coppercost|3750}} at max level)

==Progress==
I sincerely doubt you'd prefer to adjust our mechanostriders or oil my boots for spare copper instead, <name>. Go kill more goblins.

==Completion==
Your reports of their behavior are truly disturbing...but also slightly amusing.

If only [[Megs Dreadshredder|that Dreadshredder wench]] had escaped on these vessels instead...
