==Objectives==
Talk to [[Megs Dreadshredder]].
*[[Sandscraper's Scarab]] (provided)

==Description==
Inside this weathered stone chest at the back of Stonescraper's lair, you find a curious artifact.

Shaped like a beetle, its surface is a smooth, brilliant blue, lined with gold. It looks mechanical, but unlike anything you've seen crafted by mortal hands, and very old.

Megs will probably be interested in this.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

==Progress==
Find something?

==Completion==
You found that in the ogre den? That's...

...nothing to get excited about, I'm sure! I'm sure it's just...a perfectly benign trinket...that I'm going to give you precisely detailed instructions on exactly how to handle.

<Megs drops her voice to a whisper.>

Keep your voice down and don't wave that thing around.
