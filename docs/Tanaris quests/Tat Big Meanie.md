Upon accept, the Idol of Ohn'ahra extra action button becomes available.

Speak to Maru:
{{Dialogue|
How's the sleufing going?

{{Gossip|{{Text|red|(Hint)}} Where did you say I should look for clues?}}

The sleufing fingy was last seen past da potty, near da surgeons. We'll need to find a couple of clues before we can solve this mystery!
}}

The surgeons refer to [[Doctor Gustaf VanHowzen]] and [[Doctor Gregory Victor]]. The idol points to the [[Hear Historic Tales at the Storyteller Stage!]] letter nailed to the post at {{Co|62.03|51.53|Tanaris}} next to VanHowzen on the right. Behind the stall, find [[Red Hair]] at {{Co|62.12|51.76|Tanaris}} on the ground.

Maru offers another hint:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|{{Text|red|(Hint)}} I found this flyer and some red hair. What do you make of this, Maru?}}

Hmm... We must be looking for someone with red hair by the Storyteller Stage!
}}

The hints and Idol point to [[Ratts]], sitting on the center bench at {{co|64.0|51.7|Tanaris}} in front of Storyteller Stage. Speak with her:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
What do you want?

{{Gossip|What did you do with Maru's brother's sleuthing tool?}}

You have no proof!

*{{Gossip|Of course I have proof. But if you tell me now, I'll reduce your sentence.}}
*{{Gossip|Fess up, crook.}}
*{{Gossip|<Say nothing and stare at Ratts menacingly.>}}

Okay, okay! Yeah, maybe I had it, so what? You'll never find it in this mess of an event.

By now, it could be anywhere from the Fashion Frenzy to the, uh... Well, it's gone now, got it?
}}

Speak with Ratts again:
{{Dialogue|
I told you, I hid it by the Fashion Frenzy! Now get outta here!
}}

Return to Maru for another optional hint:
{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|{{Text|red|(Hint)}} Ratts said your "sleufing fingy" was near the Fashion Frenzy, but I can't find it.}}

Lemme fink... Have you tried BEHIND the stage?
}}

Head behind the [[Fashion Frenzy]] stage to find a [[Strange Torch]] at {{co|63.6|48.0|Tanaris}} on a rock by the outhouse.
