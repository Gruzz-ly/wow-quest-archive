==Objectives==
Talk to the shopkeeps.
*Talk to [[Traeya]]
*Talk to [[Historian Ma'di]]

==Description==
Now that you have an idea of some of the main attractions, let's talk shopping.

The main pavilion here contains just a few of places where you can look for amazing new purchases. Do a loop and talk to the shopkeeps to see what they have to offer.

Once you are done, come back and let me know if anything caught your fancy.

Ta-ta!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||40}}
*180 [[XP]]
*5x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Progress==
Don't be shy, you're allowed to browse. Go ahead and have a look at the wares for sale and then come back when you're done.

==Completion==
I hope you found something to your liking, or at the very least had fun browsing.

You know your way around, so now I turn you loose to go forth and enjoy yourself. This anniversary is for you, after all.

==Notes==
The three vendors are on the main floor.

Greetings, yes, come come, we have much to discuss. Wait. No, that's not right. We -will- have much to discuss. Later. Soon. Yes, soon.

I'm Bobadormu. You didn't know that yet, but now you do. Yes. This is progressing exactly as I remember.

For now, however, I believe you are going to ask to see my wares. If memory or insight serves.
