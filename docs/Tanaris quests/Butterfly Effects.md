==Objectives==
After rewinding time, create defenses for [[Moraidormi]] and test them.
* Time reversed
* [[Quickened Sand]] collected from [[Timeline Fracture]]s (6)
* Invulnerable Hourglass placed (4)
* Results observed

==Description==
We were overwhelmed by her companions. Moraidormi was still killed.

I need another strategy, one that will actually protect her. She is what matters. Go rewind time, including our actions.

After the rewind, I will hold time in place. Then we can try to make defenses for her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
What else can we do?

==Completion==
That was not any better.

It--it was clearly even worse...

I am trying not to lose focus. What if we attacked again or...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Eternus|Tell [[Nozdormu]] to use the artifact to rewind again. There is a way. I know it!}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Eternus...}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|We are trying again, Nozdormu!}}

Return to the spot by Nozdormu and use the Rewind Time extra action button again:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Each attempt will create time fissures.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|That is one reason the [[bronze dragonflight]] does not meddle in this way. Be careful, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|But we can use the ambient energy of the fissure elementals to make a shield... yes!}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|That is... unethical. Time may flow like sand, but it can also be brittle as glass. The fissures--}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Do not tell me what I already know. I will do what I must for Moraidormi.}}

The [[Timeline Fracture]] and [[Timeline Fragment]] sand elementals in the area light up. Defeat them for their [[Quickened Sand]]. After collecting six:
:{{text|say|Eternus|Pour the sand into the hourglasses I conjured. Come back when all four are in place, and I will use them to shield her.}}

Four Invulnerable Hourglass ghosts surround Moraidormi. Place them:
:{{text|say|Eternus|That should protect her. Let us watch and see.}}
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|This is an exceptionally strong shield. It may withstand the attack.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Do not patronize me. I know it will work.}}

[[File:Butterfly Effects - part two.jpg|thumb|Maybe this will work better?]]
Return to the spot next to Eternus and use the Watch Events Unfold extra action button:
:{{Abilities|Watch Events Unfold|Watching new history.|icon=petbattle_speed|id=417235}}
:{{text|yell|[[Vexemia]]|You cannot hide from me, little dragon!}}
:{{text|say|Moraidormi|Vexemia, please! We were friends!}}
:{{text|yell|Vexemia|You have a shield, I see. Ha! I will boil the very sand below you and cook you inside it!}}
:''Vexemia takes flight.''
:{{text|yell|Vexemia|Oh, what do we have here? Bronze eggs? Ha ha ha! They can burn with you!}}
:''Vexemia circles the room, using a fire breath attack on all the bronze eggs in the corners of the room. Moraidormi futilely tries to fly up but is caught by the shield and must watch helplessly.''
:{{text|say|Moraidormi|No! Fight me instead!}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|NOT AGAIN! And the eggs... destroyed! No, no, no.  I thought for sure it would work.}}
:{{text|yell|Vexemia|Foolish bronze-scale. How did you not "see" this coming? Ha!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|Eternus, I believe there is something important that you are missing.}}
