==Objectives==
Use the Bootlegger Bug Bait to capture a Hazzali Swarmer.
*Swarmer Wrangled
*[[Bootlegger Bug Bait]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that we've got a good pile of fresh chunks, we just tie it to this rope...and now you're ready to go catch me a silithid.

What? Don't give me that look, it's perfectly safe. Well, mostly safe. Okay, you might die painfully. But it'll be easy! Just throw this meat out there, wait for a bug to pounce on it, and then drag 'em back here by the rope!

Go after one of the swarmers. I haven't seen the other ones go for hyenas before, and you should find plenty of swarmers around the edge of the pit.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6,040 XP
*{{coppercost|7000}} (+{{coppercost|3600}} at max level)
*+250 [[Steamwheedle Cartel]] Reputation

==Progress==
I don't see any bug with you, pal.

==Completion==
Look at the size of it! It's glorious. This ugly sucker's gonna help us bring down the whole hive.

==Notes==
As you bring the captured Swarmer to Zeke Bootscuff, the flavor text is reminiscent of that in the film [http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0120201/ Starship Troopers]

:{{text|say|Zeke Bootscuff|Holy cats! It worked! Soothfancy, come look at this!}}
:{{text|say|Zeke Bootscuff|What's it thinking?}}
:{{text|say|Narain Soothfancy|It's afraid.}}
:{{text|yell|Narain Soothfancy|It's afraid!}}

==Trivia==
The dialogue after turning in the quest is a reference to the {{Wplink|Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers}} film, which includes the same dialogue after capturing a "brain bug" and making psychic contact with it.
