== Objectives ==
Collect 10 pieces of Pirate Booty.
*[[Pirate Booty]] (10)

== Description ==
Let's not be wasteful here, babe. These pirates have tons of valuable nonsense just sitting around, waiting to be fenced. Can you believe they just sit on this stuff?

I mean, why do they even bother taking it if it's just going to sit around? Stolen goods should be sold off and used to buy shiny new things.

Anyway, be a dear and go grab as much of their loot as you can carry while you're out busting heads. Ciao!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||65}}
* 5790 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Let's see what you've got. You're not hiding any for yourself, are you? You'll never find a buyer without me, you know. 

== Completion ==
Beautiful! And to think these idiots were just sitting on it.

Here's a bit up front, we'll talk about profit-sharing bonuses later. 

==Progression==
{{Lost Rigger Cove}}

== Patch changes ==
