== Objectives ==
Collect 20 Gold Fillings from [[Southsea Musketeer]]s or [[Southsea Strongarm]]s.
*[[Gold Filling]] (20)

== Description ==
We've looted everything that isn't bolted down around here, but I'm not done yet. If we're bothering to do the Steamwheedle Cartel's dirty work for them, we're going to make as much cash as we can while we're here.

I haven't seen many earrings on these pirates, so the gold must be in the next best place...their teeth. The Southsea musketeers and strongarms to the south are the higher-ups here; they'll be the ones with the adornment. Bring me back a good fistful of gold fillings.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||65}}
*5790 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Progress ==
Don't get squeamish on me now. 

== Completion ==
Nice!  Remember, gold is gold, no matter who's mouth, nose, or otherwise it's been in.

It's all perfectly sanitary after being melted down anyway. Or at least wiped off.
