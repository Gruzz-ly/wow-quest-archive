==Objectives==
Kill 15 [[Southsea Freebooters]] of any kind.
*[[Southsea Freebooters]] slain  (15) <!--This is only one of the mobs that counts-->

==Description==
Look, babe, you should be able to see what's happening here pretty easily. There's pirates, there's goblins, the goblins are fighting the pirates. There's some sad little gnomes trying to fight the pirates too.

I'll make it nice and simple for you: we need to kill a lot of pirates. Go do that, 'kay? We don't want the gnomes killing more than us, after all.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|30}}
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Southsea Hood|Dellot's Leggings|Branded Gloves|Cleaned-Up Pauldrons}}

==Progress==
Look, if you think the bare minimum is enough, then ok. But some people choose to kill more pirates and I encourage that, ok?

And by "ok", I mean "go kill more and stop wasting my time".

==Completion==
I'm pleased to report that our brand recognition in this area has skyrocketed now that you've killed most of the people who didn't want us here.
