Hello [[adventurer]]! I could really use your help here.

THE [[Hemet Nesingwary]] is here signing his [[Green Hills of Stranglethorn]] book. I was going to have him sign my copy, but then dust devils tore through the camp and shredded it!

[[Addie Fizzlebog|My sister]] won't let me leave the camp on my own, and I couldn't stand to tell her that the book she gave me was ruined. I could really use your help!
