==Objectives==
[[Dirge Quikcleave]] wants you to get the following items:

10 [[Giant Egg]]s. You will find those on the [[Roc]]s wandering [[Tanaris]] or any other species of large bird.

10 pieces of [[Zesty Clam Meat]]. You can find those in clams, naturally!

20 pieces of [[Fine Aged Cheddar]]. Get thee to a cheesery!

Gather all of the items and return to Dirge.
*[[Giant Egg]] (10)
*[[Zesty Clam Meat]] (10)
*[[Fine Aged Cheddar]] (20)

== Description ==
Ever heard of a clamlette? Of course you haven't! It's my latest and greatest culinary masterpiece. Oh, <name>, just thinking about a clamlette makes my mouth water.

Unfortunately, I'm all out of supplies to make any! How about I make you a deal? You gather the supplies I need to make a clamlette and I'll teach you the finer points of exotic cuisine and I'll even throw in a couple of clamlettes to boot! Deal??

Here's what I need:

== Progress ==
My cravings are going to be the end of me! Hurry, <name> - before I dip into my own supply.

== Completion ==
You are in for a special treat, <name>. Watch and learn!

<Dirge begins to prepare clamlette surprise.>

== Rewards ==
You will learn:
*[[Clamlette Magnifique]]

You will also receive:
* 5550 [[XP]]

== Tips ==
*Where to get {{loot|Common|Giant Egg|Giant Eggs}}: [[Roc]]s (level 41+) and [[Fire Roc]]s (level 43) in [[Tanaris]] are the most convenient source, but there are many large birds in other zones dropping Giant Eggs, too (e.g. [[Owlbeast]]s in [[Hinterlands]], [[Winterspring]] and [[Felwood]]. WARNING: At level 35, it will be practically impossible to gather the eggs on your own as the lowest level creatures needed to be killed to drop these items is level 41.  The best drop rates occur in the level 48-52 range.  It is recommended to either purchase the eggs from the Auction House or have a higher level friend obtain them for you.

*Where to get [[Zesty Clam Meat]]: The most reliable source of {{loot|Common|Big-Mouth Clam|Big-Mouth Clams}} (which drop Zesty Clam Meat) are [[Tidal Strider]]s at the beach south of Gadgetzan. Various shoreline mobs (level 35+), such as [[Crab]]s, [[Murloc]]s, [[Naga]], [[Thresher]]s and [[Turtle]]s, also drop them.

*Where to get [[Fine Aged Cheddar]]: You can buy it from any standard vendor that sells food and drinks.

You must have a cooking skill of 225 to start this quest.

It should be noted that players who have farmed Bloodsail reputation in order to achieve that title will be unable to receive this quest until they hit unfriendly reputation again with Gadgetzan.
