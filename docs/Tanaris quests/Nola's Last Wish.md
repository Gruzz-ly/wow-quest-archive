==Notes==
<onlyinclude>[[File:Nola's Last Wish - Lashk and Torga.jpg|thumb|[[Lashk]] and [[Torga]]]]
[[Alyx]] hands over [[My Journal: Nola's Last Wish]], which initially reads:
{{book|content=Alyx told me to check in with Lashk.}}

[[Lashk]], of the [[Zanchuli Council]], is located to the southeast, not far from the [[Story Time]] stage. Speak with him:
{{dialogue|What do you want?

{{gossip|Alyx said you seemed upset.}}

Upset? What a weak word for great grief.

Scrollsage Nola, the kindest of us all, has made her final pilgrimage.

Her final wishes were entrusted to a group of Tortaka tribesmen. I hope they were able to see them through, yet I worry still.

If you find yourself on Zandalar, please give your respects to our dearest Nola.}}

This adds to the journal:
{{book|content=Lashk told me that Scrollsage Nola's final wishes were entrusted to a group of Tortaka tribesmen.}}

[[Maru]] has a new hint:
{{dialogue|
{{Gossip|{{Text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain the case of Nola's Last Wish to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

I fink you're looking for da Tortaka tribesmen. They might be near the Tortaka Refuge in Vol'dun.
}}

[[File:Nola's Last Wish - Tuka and Kuppaka.jpg|thumb|[[Tuka]] and [[Elder Kuppaka]] at [[Tortaka Refuge]]]]
The [[Tortaka Refuge]] is located in northeastern [[Vol'dun]] at {{co|62|22|Vol'dun}} on [[Zandalar]].

Horde characters can quickly get there by taking the portal to [[Dazar'alor]] from [[Orgrimmar]]. Alliance characters can connect through [[Boralus]] by taking the portal from [[Stormwind City]] and speaking with [[Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth]] at {{co|67.9|26.7|Boralus}} at the stern of the ship and choosing the Vol'dun option. If characters have not completed the [[Alliance War Campaign]] (part of the greater [[Battle for Azeroth campaign]]), take the ship from the [[Echo Isles]] instead.

At the refuge, speak with [[Elder Kuppaka]] at {{co|61.6|20.5|Vol'dun}} next to [[Tuka]], the innkeeper:
{{dialogue|I have lived many years and seen many things. The Tortaka tribe survived long before I was born and it will survive long after I am dead.

{{gossip|I am looking for Scrollsage Nola's last wishes.}}

Ah, a couple of tribesmen to the southeast could tell you more.}}

[[File:Nola's Last Wish - notes.jpg|thumb|Notes southeast of the refuge]]
Southeast of the refuge at {{co|64|26|Vol'dun}} at the [[Darkwood Shoal]] is a pair of dead [[Tortaka Tribesman|Tortaka Tribesmen]]. Whip out the [[Idol of Ohn'ahra]] and it will point to the message board, that when hovered over shows 132, 429, and [[Nola's Last Wish (item)]].

This updates the journal:
{{book|content=I found Nola's Last Wish near a few scattered notes.

132 West<br>
429 South}}

And Maru's hint:
{{dialogue|Hmm, you found this scroll near some numbers? I wonder if da finking cap can help!}}

[[File:Nola's Last Wish - tortollan wedding.jpg|thumb|The tortollan wedding in Zuldazar]]
Reset the [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] to (0, 0) at the scroll location and head to (-132, -429) all the way to the southwest to {{co|24.4|44.5|Zuldazar}} off the western shore of [[Zuldazar]] to find the tortollan wedding! Use the Nola's Last Wish scroll to summon her spirit:

{{dialogue|This is so wonderful to see. These young lovers will be our future.

{{gossip|Lashk sent me to see your final wishes met.}}

Lashk is delightful. And thank you, <name>, for calling my spirit here.

I think... I think I am ready to rest now.

Please, tell Lashk that this old Tortollan has made it to the water.}}

Return to [[Lashk]] at the [[Caverns of Time]] in [[Tanaris]]. He has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
If only Nola were here to see this.
