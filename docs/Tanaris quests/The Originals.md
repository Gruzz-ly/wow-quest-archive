'''The Originals''' is one of two [[world boss]] weekly quests offered at the [[Bronze Celebration]]. Each week alternates between [[Timely Gate Crashers]] and this one. Unlike the other quest, the required bosses are found in locations across both [[Kalimdor]] and the [[Eastern Kingdoms]].

==Objectives==
Defeat Lord Kazzak in [[Blasted Lands]], Azuregos in [[Azshara]], and the Dragon of Nightmare at one of the portals to the Emerald Dream.
*[[Lord Kazzak (Anniversary)|Lord Kazzak]] slain
*[[Azuregos (Anniversary)|Azuregos]] slain
*[[Dragons of Nightmare (Classic)|Dragon of Nightmare]] slain

==Description==
Long ago, [[World boss|great terrors]] walked our lands, and drove even the smallest to flights of heroism.

I speak, of course, about Lord Kazzak, Azuregos, and the Dragons of Nightmare.

Legends have it that so sought after were their treasures, that armies would camp overnight to hunt them down.

The dragons have felt disturbances in the timeways, coincidentally located where these giants once roamed. 

They have tasked me with finding champions to investigate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|42}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*100 [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Progress==
So were they just memories?

==Completion==
Oh the memories. I myself ventured out to tackle these foes of the past. These battles taught me much. Take what you have learned in defeating these foes and use it to prepare you for whatever might step into your path next.

==Notes==
All bosses have very short respawn timers, unlike their classic versions. Lord Kazzak and Azuregos will spawn close to where they originally did:
*[[Lord Kazzak (Anniversary)|Lord Kazzak]] spawns at the north end of the [[Tainted Scar]] in the [[Blasted Lands]].
*[[Azuregos (Anniversary)|Azuregos]] spawns southeast of the [[Secret Lab]] in [[Azshara]].

Rather than randomly spawning at any of the four portals, the Dragons of Nightmare will spawn at fixed locations, cycling between each dragon on a daily basis:
#[[Ysondre (Anniversary)|Ysondre]] spawns at [[Dream Bough]] in [[Feralas]]
#[[Lethon (Anniversary)|Lethon]] spawns at [[Seradane]] in the [[Hinterlands]]
#[[Emeriss (Anniversary)|Emeriss]] spawns at [[Twilight Grove]] in [[Duskwood]]
#[[Taerar (Anniversary)|Taerar]] spawns at [[Bough Shadow]] in [[Ashenvale]]

Each world boss is marked clearly on world and zone maps, including which Nightmare Dragon is currently active, if it has not yet been killed for the week.
