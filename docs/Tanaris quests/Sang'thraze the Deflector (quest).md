The blood speaks. I can feel its flow through the sand...drenched in death, a desert of suffering...

<Mazoga's eyes roll back in his head.>

There! The blood flows to the south, in a valley of bones. Zakkaru! Zakkaru, spawn of Makkari, the dark one who demands sacrifice... his father forced from Zul'Farrak, his ascension interrupted... he will taste blood once more...

<Mazora reels.>
