== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Trenton Lighthammer}} at [[Sandsorrow Watch]]. 

== Description ==
If you're looking for more work, I've got a line for you.

I know an elf by the name of Trenton Lighthammer who's been obsessed with the sand trolls near here for years. He's dead-set on finding some kind of mythical sword made by them, and just a while ago he finally got a crew together to go to Sandsorrow Watch and look for it.

Last I heard, they kicked the trolls out of one of their camps and set up shop there. Look for it to the west, near [[Zul'Farrak]]. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||30}}

== Completion ==
Marin sent you? I'm appreciative of his help.

I'm here to seek out Sul'thraze. If you wish to help, speak with [[Mazoga]]...he's been cooperative so far.
