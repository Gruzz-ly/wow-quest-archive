==Objectives==
Search for signs of [[Grizzek Fizzwrench]] in [[Tanaris]].
*Speak with [[Gazlowe]]
*Investigate [[Waterspring Field]] in Tanaris.

==Description==
When this whole [[:Azerite]] mess began I had a goblin named Grizzek Fizzwrench do some research for me. He was bad for business and had to be removed from the picture. I thought it was a done deal, only now I'm hearing maybe he's not so dead.

I need you to hunt this guy down and see what happened. If he's alive, eliminate him and I'll add the standard mercenary fee to your reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<You find the charred pieces of some mechanical contraption. A [[Feathers|parrot]] maybe? It isn't Grizzek Fizzwrench, but it's evidence of his work. Perhaps there are more clues to be found in the area.>

==Notes==
*Must have completed the [[Tides of Vengeance]] [[Horde War Campaign|War Campaign]] to obtain this quest.
*Gazlowe is standing next to the ''Banshee's Wail''. Speak with him.

:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|Hey! <Name>! Over here!}}

Hey, <name>!

<Gazlowe's eyes look to either side as he motions you closer.>

I think we can make a deal here.

{{Gossip|Yeah? What kind of deal?}}

Gallywix talked to you about Fizzwrench? Yeah, I thought so.

Look, Grizzek didn't have a lick of sense when it came to politics, but he was a good guy. Between you and me? We need goblins like him, pushin' the boundaries of engineering.

So here's my counter offer. If you find Grizzek, tell him to keep his head down and tell Gallywix he's out of the picture.

Do that and I'll make sure you get paid twice as much. Sound good?

{{Gossip|You've got a deal.}}

:{{Text|say|Gazlowe|Remember, I'll pay double!}}
:''Gazlowe leaves.''
