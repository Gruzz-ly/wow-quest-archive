==Objectives==
Obtain Meatface's Chest.
* [[Meatface's Locked Chest]]

==Description==
It's time to conclude this matter efficiently. From what we've determined, this mysterious object is in the possession of the "smart" brute described in the journal. We don't know exactly what's happened to this creature, obviously, so you should take caution.

This... "Meatface" is hiding in the hills, near where these goblins bury their dead. Look for the graveyard and he should be just past it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Meatface Pummeler
|"Smart Bracers"
|Dagger of the Ides
|Gnomeregan Medallion of Merit
|Meatface's Tenderizer
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|55|}}
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
Do be careful with the contents of the chest.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.  The contents of this chest are sure to advance Gnomeregan's knowledge base significantly.  I believe you've earned a reward.

==Trivia==
*This quest's name is a reference to the phrase "{{wp|Et tu, Brute?}}" from the William Shakespeare play ''{{wp|Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar}}''.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.3.5|note=[[Meatface's Tenderizer]] added as a reward.}}
