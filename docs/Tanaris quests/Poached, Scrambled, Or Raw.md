'''Poached, Scrambled, Or Raw?''' is one of several daily quests for the {{item|Whistle of the Venomhide Ravasaur|Venomhide Ravasaur}} mount.

==Objectives==
Your [[Venomhide Hatchling]] wants you to feed it 12 Silithid Eggs.

* [[Silithid Egg]]s fed to [[Venomhide Hatchling]] (12)

==Description==
The venomhide hatchling's stomach growls as it gestures to get your attention.  It begins scratching pictures of [[silithid]]s{{Sic}} into the dirt, adding small ovals underneath them.  It looks at you hopefully and gestures at the circles.

They can only mean silithid eggs.  The [[Noxious Lair]], in western [[Tanaris]] and near the border with [[Un'Goro Crater]], would probably be a great place to find the eggs your little hatchling wants.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: 
||item1=Venomhide Baby Tooth}}

==Progress==
The hatchling looks at you.

==Completion==
Your hatchling licks its lips after devouring the meal of silithid eggs. For a moment, you think it seems disappointed that feeding time has come to an end.

==Progression==
{{:Toxic Tolerance}}

==Patch changes==
