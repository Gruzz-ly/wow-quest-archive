==Objectives==
Bring the Ancient Timewarped Scroll to [[Grannadormu]].
*[[Ancient Timewarped Scroll]] (provided)

==Description==
A haze seems to obscure the details of the scroll at first. As you concentrate on making out the scroll's features, the haze briefly dissipates revealing a pristine scroll made of the finest vellum, with a seal that looks so fresh the wax doesn't even seem set yet. In a blink, the scroll feels dangerously brittle, and the seal so delicate it could crack at any moment. As the haze begins to form again, you see the scroll shimmer through all possible points between these two extremes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*11,605 [[XP]]
*500x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Completion==
Scrolls are fascinating items. They travel far and wide across the lands, yet this one seems to also travel through time.

The fact that you found this scroll where you did is both an omen and a blessing.
