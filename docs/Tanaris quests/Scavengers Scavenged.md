==Objectives==
Use [[Butcherbot]] to harvest 12 [[Fire Roc]] corpses.
*Fire Rocs Harvested (12)
*[[Butcherbot Control Gizmo]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that I know you're not squeamish, I've got another job for you. Have you seen the red-feathered birds swarming around the bones out there? Those are fire rocs. They'll light you up good if you're not careful.

They're also pretty darn valuable thanks to their unique anatomy. Most of the hunters loafing around here aren't up to the task of killing fire-spitting buzzards for money...think you can handle it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|6500}} (+{{coppercost|4200}} at max level)
*6,900 experience
*250 reputation with [[Gadgetzan]]

==Progress==
I've heard about this [[Nesingwary]] guy, out of [[Stranglethorn Vale]], hunting all sorts of beasts for sport.

For SPORT.  What a complete idiot, right?  Think of all the profit he's letting rot in the field!

==Completion==
Alchemists pay through the nose for these things. Sure, maybe I tell some of them they're dragon parts, but that ain't my problem, right?
