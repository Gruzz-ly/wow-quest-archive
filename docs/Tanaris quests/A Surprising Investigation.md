==Description==
Well, look who's back to solve more cases.

It seems that [[Chromie]] has been fiddling with time again and some imposters have popped up around the celebration area.

All you need to do is identify who doesn't belong and send them to Chromie. This should be a breeze for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 8x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Progress==
How goes it?

==Completion==
This was quite a surprise! It's nice to get a chance to relax.

==Notes==
Check in with [[Maru]]:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|{{text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain your primary case to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

I fink Detective Jones wants you to look around this area and find people tat stand out.

If you see da same person in more than one place, one of them is probably an imposter!}}

Five characters are in more than one location:
*[[Big Kinook]] {{co|63.0|49.8|Tanaris}} by [[Moira Thaurissan]]
{{dialogue|A good day for good soup.}}
*[[Maru]] {{co|61.9|49.9|Tanaris}} in the pet playground
{{dialogue|Woah... What's this place?}}
*[[Lorewalker Cho]] {{co|61.6|51.0|Tanaris}} by the ice rink and [[Detective Ace]]
{{dialogue|What wisdom do you seek, <class>?}}
*[[Jepetto Joybuzz]] {{co|63.8|51.8|Tanaris}} by the Story Time stage
{{dialogue|So many mechanized wonders. The imagination is abuzz with possibilities!}}
*[[Reshad]] {{co|63.0|49.2|Tanaris}} on the Fashion Frenzy stage by [[Soulbinder Tuulani]]
{{dialogue|The past has much to teach us.}}

{{dialogue|{{gossip|You're in the wrong timeline. Go find [[Chromie]].}}}}
*{{text|say|I need to get back!}}
*{{text|say|That explains things...}}
*{{text|say|Oh no!}}

After finding all five, check in with Maru again:
{{dialogue|You found all da imposters!

Detective Jones would know what to do next.}}

Return to [[Athelton Jones]]:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|I found all of the imposters.}}

Ah, perfect.

Now I need you to distribute these letters. They will explain to everyone what has happened.

Don't read any of them! The timeline depends on it!}}

Jones hands over a stack of [[Letters]]. Before handing them out, check with Maru again:
{{dialogue|You need to hand out da letters to visitors in the area!}}

Use the quest item to get a ground-targeting reticle, then throw the letters at basically all of the named characters that don't patrol around the celebration area. All of the main timed activities (Mount Mania, Fashion Frenzy, Story Time) and the food stalls are target-rich environments. Aim for clumps to get multiple characters at once!
:{{text|say|<targeted character>|Thanks!}}

After delivering ten, check in with Maru again:
{{dialogue|I fink Detective Jones wants to talk to you again.}}

Then return to Athelton Jones:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|I've distributed the letters.}}

Now I just need you to check up on something for me.

I made a request for a "lucky feast" that I heard rumors about.

Can you make sure the order has been fulfilled?}}

Maru provides a tip if players have forgotten about [[Bonenose]]:
{{dialogue|A lucky feast? Didn't you meet someone at da beach who had you help wiff somefing like tat?}}

Bonenose and his two buccaneers are at their usual spot {{co|60.9|44.7|Tanaris}} at [[Waterspring Field]] north of the [[Caverns of Time]]:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|Detective Jones asked me to check on his food order.}}

Ah yes, I've got the order.

I'm supposed to tell you to go to the northern part of the beach now.}}

Maru updates her hint:
{{dialogue|<Maru giggles.>

I fink you should go to [[Wavestrider Beach]]!}}

[[File:A Surprising Investigation.jpg|thumb|The party area on [[Wavestrider Beach]]]]
By "northern part of the beach" Bonenoes means "head east" to Wavestrider Beach, where adventurers first ran into [[The "Great" Detective]]. Athelton Jones is standing at the west end of the party area:

{{dialogue|Hah! I bet you didn't see this coming!

{{gossip|What's going on?}}

We decided to put on a little surprise for you and Alyx for all your hard work.

Take a look around, grab some snacks, and enjoy a deserved rest from your detective work.}}
