==Objectives==
Save 8 [[Captured Goblin Bughunter]]s from Hazzali Cocoons.

==Description==
We haven't just been camped here singin' songs with gnomes and playing with dangerous machinery, you know. My men have been trying to clear this hive out for a week now! Problem is, we've taken so many losses by now that the bugs have the advantage.

Lucky for us, the bugs either don't like to eat goblins, or they like us so much they save us as treats, because nearly all my men are still cocooned up out there. I need you to go save 'em.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Dangerous Machinery Piece|Bughunter Belt|Loaner Bracers|Goblin Treat Tin}}

You will receive: {{coppercost|7000}} (+{{coppercost|3600}} at max level)

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Thanks for the help, this was really killin' things here. Once you start losing men, you start losing manpower. And morale. And weapons. And the magazines you loaned to that one guy.

==Trivia==
* The goblins you rescue are dressed to resemble the soldiers from the film {{wplink|Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers}}.
