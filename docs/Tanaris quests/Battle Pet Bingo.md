'''Battle Pet Bingo''' concludes the seventh hidden local story of [[Guest Relations]], started on 18 November and required for [[Assistant to the Assistant Guest Relations Manager]].

==Objectives==
Find the battle pets based on the riddles.
* Ask [[Maru]] for a hint (Optional)
* Pets found (0/100%)
* [[Bingo Card]] (provided)

==Description==
Well, hi there! The grand master pet tamers from [[Pandaria]] have posted a challenge to find certain battle pets on this fancy-lookin' bingo card.

All we have to do is find the pet that goes to the riddle and note it down on our bingo cards, but I'm having a hard time with the last two. It's quite easy to spot the normal pets, but these bingo cards require us to find special versions of the creatures.

Hmm... They didn't say anything in the rules about getting outside help. Care to help a friend out?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 5x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Progress==
Have you any luck in finding the battle pets?

==Completion==
Hey, thanks a bunch friend!

BINGO!

==Notes==
Jepetto hands over a [[Bingo Card]], which reads:
{{book|content=Bingo riddle spot #1:

* In the heart of the [[Bamboo Wilds]], where the sun dapples through the canopy, seek the creature that leaps among the shadows.
* [[Idol of Ohn'ahra|Ohn'ahra's]] eyes will help you spot your target.

Bingo riddle spot #2:

* High atop [[Kun-Lai Summit|Kun-Lai's]] peaks so steep,
* Where the snow is thick and the ledges deep,
* I stand on high, where the air is clear,
* A tiny figure, you'll approach with cheer.
* Ohn'ahra's eyes will help you spot your target.}}

Check in with Maru:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|{{text|red|(Hint)}} <Explain the case of Battle Pet Bingo to Maru and ask for her advice.>}}

There's so many forests in da panda land!

I fink I saw some spoopy crawly animals near a pretty lake in the Jade Forest.

For the second riddle, try looking reeaaaally high up in the snowy area.}}

Head to the [[Jade Forest]] via the portals in [[Stormwind City]] and [[Orgrimmar]]. A huge quest blob lights up the southern third of the zone map. The [[Bamboo Wilds]] are north and east of [[Pearlfin Village]]. Whip out the [[Idol of Ohn'ahra]] and head to {{co|64.0|80.8|Jade Forest}} to spot the [[Jumping Spider (object)|Jumping Spider]].

Really high up in the snowy area would be one of the mountains in [[Kun-Lai Summit]]. Skip ahead to the highest peak, that of [[Neverest Pinnacle]], to find the [[Summit Kid (object)|Summit Kid]] at {{co|44.4|52.5|Kun-Lai Summit}} on the very peak overlooking the statue of [[Ren Yun the Blind]].
