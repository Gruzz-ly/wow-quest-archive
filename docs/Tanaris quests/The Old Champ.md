==Objectives==
Find [[Kajind]] somewhere in {{C|Azshara}}.

==Description==
This arena may not look like much, but I'll tell ya, this place used to be quite the attraction. Prize fighters, [[adventurer]]s, even a few [[cartel]] folks, would all step into the ring for a chance at coin and glory.

Between the [[gambling]] and concessions, I was making a killing!

Things started to die down after the old champ, Kajind, retired, though. He was a real serious type; left for Azshara one day without a word. If you found him, we could get the arena back up and running again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2350 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<A wistful expression briefly crosses Kajind's face>

Indeed, I am the so-called "champ" you seek.
