==Objectives==
Deliver the artifact to [[Andoren Dawnrise]] at the [[Valley of the Watchers]].

==Description==
Listen carefully, <name>. I don't know how those ogres got ahold of it, but that thing's a titan artifact. I'm no expert, but just that fact alone makes it probably older than the sand we're standing on.

I also know that things like this are nothing but trouble. I don't want anything to do with it. Take it south, to the Valley of the Watchers, and give it to a [[blood elf]] named [[Andoren Dawnrise]] there. And don't ask any questions, babe, please.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35}}
*3100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Of all the...you found this in an ogre den? Unthinkable. I'm amazed they didn't try to smash it to pieces.

With any luck, <class>, we'll be able to obtain even more fascinating antiquities here...if you're willing to help.
