==Objectives==
Collect 6 pieces of Hyena Meat.
*[[Hyena Chunk]] (6)

==Description==
I've got an idea, but we're going to need bait.

The other day I saw a [[Rabid Blisterpaw|rabid]] [[Blisterpaw Hyena|blisterpaw hyena]] wander too close to the edge of the chasm, and one of the [[silithid]] comes diving out of nowhere. Nearly swallowed it whole! Horrible sight.

So we're gonna need hyena meat, obviously. Go gather some, make sure it's fresh, and bring it back here. There should be plenty just north of the camp.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|7000}} (+{{coppercost|3600}} at max level)
+250 Reputation with Ratchet, Gadgetzan, Booty Bay and Everlook

==Progress==
This is fresh, right? They won't go after anything that's been withering in the sun.

==Completion==
Man, this stuff looks delicious. I'm half tempted to just fry some up myself.

No! We've gotta focus on gettin' out of here.

Maybe just one piece...
