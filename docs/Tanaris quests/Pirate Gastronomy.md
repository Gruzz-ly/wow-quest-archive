==Description==
Here are [[Cooktholomew]]'s notes deciphered. Even though this still looks strange, I am positive I deciphered it correctly. 

I was able to work out how much of everything you need, but it looks like he had his own names for different ingredients, so... good luck!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|23|40}}
* 10x [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Progress==
Don't ya worry. We're a patient bunch, we are.

==Completion==
Luck and fortune be upon us, you've done it! Now we can make our feast and set sail back home.

Thanks a bunch, pal!

==Notes==
Rosa hands over [[The Case of the Superstitious and Hungry Pirates]], with new notes starting on page two. It initially reads:
{{book|content=Rosa assures me these notes are deciphered, but Cooktholomew refers to things using terms familiar only to him. I still need to figure out what items he's talking about.}}

She also hands over the [[Boonful Banquet]], which has been translated on page two. It reads: 
{{book|content=Translation Notes from Rosa<br>
<nowiki>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</nowiki>

* Equal parts Rogue's Thistle and Banana Rum Berries (2 of each).
* Half as many Fire Breathing Chili Sacs as Rogue's Thistle (1 of these).
* As much Koatini's Oil as Banana Rum Berries (2 of these).
* As many Deadwind Catfish as Nettles and Crawdaddies altogether (5 of these).
* Twice as much Giant Growth Fish as the two Nettles (4 of these).
* Equal parts Sholazar Nettles and Oil (2 of these).
* Three Highland Crawdaddies (3 of these).}}

Rosa did a partial translation, but not all the way to the actual names of the items, so speak with [[Maru]] to see if she has any advice:
{{dialogue|Oooo! Secret recipes and encrypted ingredient lists? Which one do you need help wiff?

{{gossip|Rogue's thistle.}}
{{dialogue-child|Hmm. He called it shadow leaf, which decoded to rogue's thistle.

Tat sounds a lot like swiftthistle to me. Rogues use tat all the time to make thistle tea!}}

{{gossip|Banana rum berries.}}
{{dialogue-child|Hmm. He called it daffy juice berries, which decoded to banana rum berries.

Tat sounds like witchberries! Those are used to make banana-infused rum, from what I've heard.}}

{{gossip|Fire breathing chili sacs.}}
{{dialogue-child|Hmm. He called it blaze gasping ice pods, which decoded to fire breathing chili sacs.

Tat might be small flame sacs, used to make dragonbreath chili.}}

{{gossip|Koatini's oil.}}
{{dialogue-child|Hmm. He called it koatini's grease, which decoded to koatini's oil.

I fink tat's aromatic fish oil! You can extract it yourself, but Koatini is the only person I know who sells it.}}

{{gossip|Deadwind catfish.}}
{{dialogue-child|Hmm. He called it ghost breath mouser brine, which decoded to deadwind catfish.

Tat sounds like bloodfin catfish to me. They're all over Deadwind Pass.}}

{{gossip|Giant growth fish.}}
{{dialogue-child|Hmm. He called it bumper flower brinestock, which decoded to giant growth fish.

Tat might be a deviate fish. It's one of the fings you need to make an elixir of giant growth, I fink.}}

{{gossip|Sholazar nettles.}}
{{dialogue-child|Hmm. He called it sholazar roils, which decoded to sholazar nettles.

Tat could refer to nettlefish in da Sholazar Basin.}}

{{gossip|Highland crawdaddies.}}
{{dialogue-child|Hmm. He called it hummock jaypops, which decoded to highland crawdaddies.

I bet tat's furious crawdads! But where could you find those?}}
}}

After exhausting all of Maru's options, the journal adds:
{{book|content=
* Rogue's Thistle suggests [[:Thistle Tea]], which would mean I need [[:Swiftthistle]].
* Banana Rum Berries suggests [[:Witchberries]], which you need to brew [[Banana-Infused Rum|Banana Rum]].
* Fire Breathing Chili Sacs suggests [[:Dragonbreath Chili]], meaning I need [[Small Flame Sac]]s.
* Koatini's Oil suggests [[:Aromatic Fish Oil]] since [[Koatini]] is the only vendor I know of who sells that.
* Deadwind Catfish suggests [[:Bloodfin Catfish]] since [[Deadwind Pass]] is where those fish can be found.
* Giant Growth Fish suggests [[:Deviate Fish]], which you need to make [[Elixir of Giant Growth|Elixirs of Giant Growth]].
* Sholazar Nettles suggests [[:Nettlefish]] since [[Sholazar Basin]] is where those fish can be found.
* Highland Crawdaddies suggest [[Furious Crawdad]]s, which are found in [[Highland Mixed School]]s in the [[Terokkar Forest]].}}

With that, it's time for a world tour. All items can be bought (at drastically inflated prices) from the [[Auction House]], or acquired via the methods below:

After collecting all of the ingredients, return to [[Bonenose]] at {{co|60.9|44.7|Tanaris}} north of the [[Caverns of Time]] in [[Tanaris]] on the shore of [[Waterspring Field]]:

{{dialogue|{{gossip|I have all the ingredients for your boonful banquet.}}

Looks like all you're missing now is the secret ingredient.

{{gossip|What? There's another ingredient I need to find?}}

Aye! I'm not entirely sure where or what it is though.

I asked him about it once, and he only chuckled and said, "In the farthest north, start yer thinkin' at the foot of the Lone Watcher. Then follow twelve as the sun sets, and eight over his left shoulder."

<Bonenose shrugs.>

I don't have a clue, but that's all I have for ya, I'm afraid.

{{gossip|Okay, well, I'm off to find whatever that is.}}}}

[[File:Pirate Gastronomy - Lone Watcher.jpg|thumb|The lone watcher]]
Check in with Maru:
{{dialogue|Hmmmmm... Da farthest norf has to be [[Northrend]], right? [[Benatauk|Unco Benny]] used to tell me about a [[Hrothgar's Landing|small island]] even more norf than the main continent! Maybe there's a [[Tuskarr]] "watcher" somewhere on tat island. And if so...

<Maru seems to be concentrating really hard.>

Da sun sets to the west...<br>
Facing west and... <mumble> right shoulder... is norf...

This one sure takes a lot of finking!}}

[[File:Pirate Gastronomy - Ice Block.jpg|thumb|"Cold Storage" in the form of an Ice Block]]
Head to [[Dalaran]] in [[Northrend]] and fly all the way north to [[Hrothgar's Landing]], off the northern coast of [[Icecrown]]. At {{co|58.4|14.3|Hrothgar's Landing}} on the northeast coast is a lone [[tuskarr]] statue. The quest will advance here, so equip the [[Tricked-Out Thinking Cap]] at the base of the statue to reset it to (0, 0) and head to (-12, 8) to find at {{co|55.4|10.8|Hrothgar's Landing}} [[Ice Block (Hrothgar's Landing)|Ice Blocks]]. Loot it to pick up a [[Deep Sea Monsterbelly]], which, could've been fished from any ocean water in Northrend. Oh well. Return once more to Bonenose.

This completes Chapter 3 of [[I Saved the Party and All I Got Were These Lousy Hats]].
