==Objectives==
Defeat [[Zumonga]].
*Zumonga Defeated
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
Splendidly done! But you'll be fighting more than mere [[human]]s!

Your next opponent's a mean one...watch out for his right hook. And his left. I'd be wary of his fists in general.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|2|10}}

==Progress==
Stop wasting my time. Enter and fight!

==Completion==
Not bad. You've got a ways to go, however. 

==Progression==
