==Description==
Welcome to the [[Bronze Celebration]]! 

We invite you to enjoy our myriad of events. You might choose to mirror your pet and run around our playground. 

You could participate in one of our big events like Fashion Frenzy or Mount Mania. A different event begins every 15 minutes. 

Or you might fancy yourself a challenge. If so seek out Moira for a journey back to Blackrock Depths, or Chromie as she cleans up her Codex to prepare for her tours. 

Any event will do, as long as you are having fun!

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: [[Blessings of the Bronze Dragonflight]]

You will receive:
*{{Cost||40}}
*180 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are you enjoying our fine celebration?

==Completion==
It is fulfilling to see so many denizens of Azeroth and beyond visiting our celebration. It is in remembering all our pasts that we are able to come together and celebrate. 

We hope that you will continue to enjoy our event. To assist you in your own adventures, take this boon of the bronze flight!

==Progress sources==
Various celebration activities increase the participation meter.

At the event grounds at the [[Caverns of Time]]:
* [[Story Time]] - 4% percent for each crowd participation action<!-- tested on all 3 stories. even includes "rotten apples", which can be spammed quickly unlike other actions -->
<!-- will add once all 3 are recorded:
* Thassarian story - 28% increase total
* Baine/Magatha story - up to 52-56% increase total, depending how many rotten apples you throw
-->
* [[Fashion Frenzy]] - 5% per ribbon awarded to another player (25% total per round)
* [[Mount Mania]] - 5% for each mount matched
* [[Pet Mirror]] - 2% for transforming into a pet and for each interaction with related objects (Basket, Cauldron, costumes, etc)
* [[A Time to Reflect]] - 10% upon completion
* [[Displaced Scarab Gong]] - 1% per ring on the gong, with a cooldown of 1 minute
* Balloon Riding - 1% for each 30 seconds being carried by a [[Balloonist|celebration balloon]]; one full ride takes about 2.25 minutes (4% total progress)
* Ice Rink - Standing or sliding on the rink seems to occasionally grant 1% progress at a time, but it is inconsistent and infrequent

Outside of the event grounds:
* [[Codex of Chromie]] - 66% upon completing the scenario
** There is ''no'' extra participation credit for completing [[Chromie's Codex (quest)]]
* Anniversary world bosses - 17% for each of [[:the Originals (achievement)|the Originals]] and [[:the Gatecrashers]] (102% total for all six, not including extra [[nightmare dragon]]s beyond the first)
* [[Blackrock Depths (Timewalking)|Blackrock Depths]] bosses - 8% per major boss

==Notes==
* This quest becomes available again immediately whenever a character's [[Blessings of the Bronze Dragonflight]] buff expires. It also becomes available at the start of each week, even for characters who already have the buff.
* During the 20th Anniversary, killing Classic [[Timewalking]] bosses would also provide credit.
