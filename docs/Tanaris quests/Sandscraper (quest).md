== Objectives ==
Kill Sandscraper.
*{{npc||Sandscraper}} slain

== Description ==
My other assistants are making sure our proud new comrades are put into comfy cages and shipped to where they're needed most. For the Horde. Meanwhile, we've got one last item on our agenda.

Sandscraper, the chief of the Dunemaul Clan, is probably too dumb to even be aware of what we're doing here. But I absolutely loathe unfinished business, babe. He's lurking in the den just over there to the west. Knuckle down, take him out, and we'll be good to sign off on this, 'kay?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Knuckle Down
|Sandscraper Bracers

}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|55|}}
* 2,600 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

== Completion ==
And that's a wrap! Nothing left here for us but sand. Good job, babe.

Well, maybe I shouldn't be so hasty. Did you find anything in that ogre den?
