'''Warbands: Warbanding Together''' introduces players to the [[Warband]] concept, what Blizzard is now calling [[account-wide]] progression, collections, and storage.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Blue (dracthyr)|Blue]] and her [[Warband]] in [[Gadgetzan]].

==Description==
Hey <name>, some friends and I have teamed up to form a Warband and are working on something that should make cooperation so much easier, even when we're apart!

We just need a little help with this last step.

Come find us in Gadgetzan when you get a moment!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||5}}
* 30 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thanks for coming, <name>!

==Notes==
Blue can be found with her Warband in the [[Road Warrior]] in Gadgetzan. The group consists of herself, as well as [[Crags]], [[Rivet]], [[Arnott Granwin]] and [[Kralla Earthstorm]], as well as their two dogs [[Berkeley]] and [[Sir Humphrey]].
