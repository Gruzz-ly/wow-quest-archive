==Objectives==
Collect Spatial Residue from the Partially Teleported creatures near [[Gadgetzan]].
*[[Spatial Residue]] (8)

==Description==
There are an awful lot of half-teleported things wandering around the desert not too far from here. Really, any at all would be a surprising amount, but there are a bunch of them for some reason!

They don't seem particularly nice, but I bet we could learn from their predicament to ensure the [[:Warband Bank Distance Inhibitor]] doesn't teleport our sweet loot into a tree!

See if you can find anything that might help us figure out what went wrong. It's not like people randomly teleport around, right?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|5|35|}}
* 2,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Any clues?

==Completion==
Great job, <name>! I'm not sure what that is, but I bet it'll help!
