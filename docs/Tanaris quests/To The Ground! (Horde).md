==Objectives==
Set fire to the Northwest Shack, the Southeast Shack, and the Northeast Shack.
*Northwest Shack
*Southwest Shack
*Northeast Shack
*[[Burning Rum]] (provided)

==Description==
I've conducted a thorough appraisal of the real estate here and, unfortunately, its market value is just far too low to be of any use. We're going to have to renovate.

Luckily for you, I've learned a few things about arson. Hopefully you have too! You're going to be throwing these perfectly safe bottles of flaming rum at those filthy ramshackle huts over there.

Try not to stand downwind.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||65|}}
*5790 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Completion==
Wonderful job. Have you ever thought about becoming a full-time arsonist? I know a few people, it's a nice gig.

Well, we'll chit-chat about that one later. More to do here!
