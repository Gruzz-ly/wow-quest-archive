==Objectives==
Talk to [[Narain Soothfancy]] to pilot the Mind-Controlled Swarmer into the Gaping Chasm hive.

==Description==
Now it's time for my plan to go into full effect. We've got the captured bug strapped up with as many explosives as it can carry, and with Soothfancy's mostly amazing mental powers, we're gonna drive that sucker straight down into the center of the underground hive.

And then...BOOM! No more bugs!

You get the personal honor of directin' the ugly thing. Go talk to Narain and get set up with your bug-pal.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Choose your reward:|Pendant of the Gaping Chasm|Mostly-Amazing Gloves|Bootscuff Boots|Bootlegger Legplates}}
You will receive: {{coppercost|13500}} (+{{coppercost|4500}} at max level)
+350 Reputation with Ratchet, Gadgetzan, Booty Bay and Everlook

==Progress==
I didn't hear no cave-ins, pal! Try again!

==Completion==
Oh man, that was awesome! You should've seen the flames coming out of the hive!

Here's your reward, for entertaining me as much as for clearing the hive!

==Notes==
Talking to [[Narain Soothfancy]] offers:
:{{Gossip|I'm ready to pilot our silithid.}}
The [[Hazzali Swarmer]] captured in the previous quest becomes a remote-controlled [[vehicle]] strapped with explosives at this point, with two abilities:
* {{abilities|Sense Pheremones|Sniff the air for pheromones to find a trail leading you into the hive. |id=73207 |icon=spell_shadow_detectlesserinvisibility |notes=Trail is revealed within a medium radius. No cooldown.}}
* {{abilities|Detonate Silithid|Detonate the Silithid's payload. You must be deep inside the Hazzali Hive. |id=73211 |icon=inv_misc_bomb_05 |notes=Cannot be activated in the wrong location.}}
The other Hazzali silithid will be friendly to the Swarmer, so this is a no-risk finale to the storyline, simply requiring getting to the right place in the hive and then detonating. The trail sensed by the ability shows as bright, hazy orange lines between orange clouds of pheremones; reaching the hive entrance (towards the southeast of the [[Gaping Chasm]]) by a different path is also fine.

In the first large circular chamber reached underground (noticeably filled with bugs), the Swarmer must climb on top of the "pedastal" in the center of the room to detonate, completing the quest.

==Progression==
{{Bootlegger Outpost}}
Next, [[Narain Soothfancy]] offers an alliance-only breadcrumb to [[Land's End Beach]]: [[Land's End]]

Completing this quest fulfils the "Bug Free" portion of the [[Tanaris Quests]] achievement.
