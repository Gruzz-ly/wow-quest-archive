De trial can't be stopped after it starts, but we won't let [[Witch Doctor Tzadah|Tzadah]] use our people or our [[loa]] to aid Mueh'zala.

If we be doing nothing, even more [[Darkspear tribe|Darkspear]] could be swayed to find power in Mueh'zala. I'll look for a way to breach Tzadah's protective energy, you stop the spirits from taking over our home!

You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

Good work with those minions. Dat will keep them off our backs for what be ahead.

==Notes==

Talking to [[Master Gadrin]] nearby:
{{dialogue| Why would Tzadah take dis path...? I failed another apprentice.}}

Meeting up with Rokhan and Kevo ya Siti after killing Mueh'zala's minions it is apparent that they are in the process of empowering Rokhan's weapons for the fight ahead. 

:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Kevo ya Siti. Empower my blades, as ya did for shadow hunters in de past.}}
:{{Text|say|Jani|Jani has something to help! Me looking for it.}}
:{{Text|say|Jani|You be seeing. Good item.}}

Speaking to [[Kevo ya Siti]]:
{{dialogue| This will take some time, but I be glad to strengthen Chieftain Rokhan's weapons for the fight ahead.

Jani may have something in mind for you.}}

[[Jani]] nearby can be seen Rummaging in [[Jani's Junkpile (heritage)|her trash pile]]:
{{dialogue| Didn't forget Jani dis time, did ya!

{{gossip|What are you looking for?}}
{{dialogue-child|
Special thing to protect you. Pretty sure it be in here.

If you be fighting up top, you might fall and crush your bones. Might be nice to not fall to your death, huh?

But I ruined the surprise! Pretend it be a surprise when I reveal de item, okay?

{{Gossip|Got it.}}
}}}}
