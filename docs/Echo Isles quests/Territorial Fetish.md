==Objectives==
Place 8 Territorial Fetishes on [[Spitescale Flag|Spitescale flags]].
* Territorial Fetish placed (8)
* [[Territorial Fetish (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Dis is no casual counter-attack. We be fully intendin' ta slaughter every last [[naga]] here and do anything we can ta ensure that dey will have no desire ta return.

I want ya ta place dese fetishes on any [[Spitescale]] banner ya be findin' inside their cave. It should prove a clear statement of what we think of their presence here. More dan dat, da magic in dese fetishes will be weakenin' any Spitescale dat approach, which should make dem second guess stayin' on our isle.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||75}}

==Progress==
Da naga have gotten more and more aggressive each time we meet. I suspect dey have a new leader behind dem now and dat their aims have ta do with more dan just territory or revenge.

==Completion==
Dat should keep dem at bay.

==Progression==
