==Objectives==
Obtain the [[Glaive of Vol'jin]].
* [[The Glaive of Vol'jin]]

==Description==
When fighting someone who has escaped the grasp of [[Bwonsamdi]], as [[Zalazane]] has, it is best to bring weapons that can hurt him.

In [[Darkspear Hold]] you will find the Glaive of [[Vol'jin]].

It should have enough bond with Vol'jin's [[ghost|spirit]] to aid us in this fight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Zandalari Empire (faction)|Zandalari Empire]]
* +250 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Did you find the glaive?

==Completion==
The bond between Vol'jin and Zalazane was one of [[magic]] and bargains with [[loa]].

The bond between Vol'jin and dis weapon was also great. Dis may be what we need to finally destroy that spirit.

==Progression==
{{Spirits Be With You}}
