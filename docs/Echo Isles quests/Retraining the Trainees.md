==Objectives==
Extract 8 shadows from lost trainees after weakening them.
*Lost Trainee darkness removed (8)
*Return to [[Rokhan]] in the [[Echo Isles]].
*[[Cunning Charm]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Witch Doctor Tzadah|Your witch doctor]] is trying to twist the trial to empower [[Mueh'zala]]. Many will be enthralled by this power, but we still stand with the [[Darkspear tribe|Darkspear]].

I had a different trial in mind. Now, we adapt. Free your fellow [[Jungle troll|trolls]] from his sacrificial [[magic]]. Dis charm will help them, but you must weaken them first.

Try not to sacrifice dem.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Progress==
Use the charm on the trainees after you weaken them!

==Completion==
This will reduce the ritual's power. Mueh'zala does not get to claim more Darkspear!

==Notes==
Talking to [[Kevo ya Siti]]:

Weaken the following trainees: [[Lost Trainee Druid]], [[Lost Trainee Hunter]], [[Lost Trainee Priest]], [[Lost Trainee Rogue]], [[Lost Trainee Shaman]], [[Lost Trainee Warlock]], and [[Lost Trainee Warrior]].
