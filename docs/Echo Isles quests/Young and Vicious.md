==Objectives==
Capture [[Swiftclaw]] and bring him back to the pens near [[Darkspear Hold]].
* Capture Swiftclaw
* Return Swiftclaw to the Raptor Pens
* [[Bloodtalon Lasso]] (provided)

==Description==
Ya be a good one, <name>.

[[Moraya]] was askin' for new raptors ta train. We shouldn't keep her waitin' any longa! I have a few other recruits bringin' some over as well, but I have a special one dat I've been promisin' Moraya for a while.

Swiftclaw be one of our fastest and bravest young raptors yet, but he can be a bit unruly. I'll lend ya da lasso, I just need ya to catch him somewhere on da island here and steer him over to da pens on da main isle. I doubt he'll be makin' it easy on ya though.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Moraya's Belt

}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Did ya come back wit one of the raptors I sent ya for?

==Completion==
Swiftclaw! Kijara was tellin' me about him and he sounded like he'd be a handful. I don't mind da challenge - it's da spirited ones like dat that be makin' da bravest and truest companions when real times of need be comin'.

Tank ya, hon. Ya've been very helpful.

==Notes==
Swiftclaw runs around the small island that the quest giver is on. Use the item on him and you will be able to ride him.
:{{text|emote|Swiftclaw isn't stopping! Steer him back to the raptor pens near Darkspear Hold.}}
