Hear [[Bwonsamdi]]'s message to the [[Darkspear tribe|Darkspear]] [[Jungle troll|trolls]] and find a solution.
*Destroy [[Mueh'zala Offering]]s (5)
*Assist [[Witch Doctor Tzadah|Tzadah]] with [[loa]] ritual

==Description==
Bwonsamdi does not be visiting in person without a good reason. Listen to all he has to say. Den we think, den we act.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What Bwonsamdi be saying is very serious. Mueh'zala worship is a bloody one.

==Completion==
De Darkspear always be worshipping multiple loa, but [[Mueh'zala]]? We can do better.

Our path is obvious.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|Dis is about Mueh'zala, de loa I hold captive. Some of de tribe be giving him tribute. Sacrifices. Blood.}}
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|Look around. There be tributes even here.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Darkspear? Turning to Mueh'zala? <Name>, destroy de tributes!}}

Rokhan, Master Gadrin, and Bwonsamdi have new gossip:

{{Dialogue|title=Rokhan|What Bwonsamdi be saying is very serious. Mueh'zala worship be bloody.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Bwonsamdi|
Mueh'zala be talkin' with Darkspear trolls.

{{Gossip|Who is Mueh'zala?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
He was de Loa of Death before your ol friend Bwonsamdi. Some trolls still followed him, but he was working with de [[Jailer]] all along. He took [[Helya]] to de Jailer's side, got [[Odyn|Odin]]{{sic}} to give up [[Eye of the Jailer|his eye]], and tricked [[Vol'jin]] into making [[Sylvanas]] ya [[Warchief]]. He trapped other loa in de [[Shadowlands]].

He be a mean one, but I got him under control. Locked up in De [[Other Side]], as long as no one helps him.

{{Gossip|He sounds like trouble.}}
}}}}

{{Dialogue|title=Master Gadrin|
Back when Vol'jin had questions, he turned to de loa. We called it de Trial of de Loa.

{{Gossip|Tell me more about the Trial of the Loa.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Vol'jin sought de advice of the loa with Witch Doctor [[Zalazane]], to find out what the future would hold.

De loa tested dem, deep in the forest of [[First Home]], with trials that would give them answers. When dey awoke from de trial, dey did not remember exactly what happened within, but dey had new instincts dat would guide the future of de Darkspear.

Destroy the Mueh'zala Offerings around [[Darkspear Hold]]. Upon destroying all of them:
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|De traitors picked de wrong loa to follow. Ya need to fix dis.}}
:''Bwonsamdi disappears.''
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|We followed only death for too long. We need ta balance de Darkspear. We need our old loa back.}}
:{{Text|say|Witch Doctor Tzadah|We have no tribute, no shrines, but I can try to call on dem.}}
:''Witch Doctor Tzadah heads to the [[Altar of the Loa]] and tries to call them but fails.''
:{{Text|say|Master Gadrin|Apprentice! Ya be all right?}}

The adventurer assists Tzadah with the loa ritual but the loa do not answer.
:{{Text|say|Witch Doctor Tzadah|Dey do not hear our call, or dey do not wish to return.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|We neglected dem too long. We must seek dem out.}}

Upon quest completion, Bwonsamdi reappears:
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|De ritual failed, mmm? Pity.}}
