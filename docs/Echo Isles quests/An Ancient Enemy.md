:{{text|yell|Vol'jin|Ya were foolish to come 'ere, Sea Witch. Ya escaped our vengeance once, but the Darkspear Tribe will not abide ya trespassin' again.}}
:{{text|yell|Zar'jira|You are weak Vol'jin, like your father was weak. Today I will finish what I started long ago - the Darkspear shall be wiped from existence!}}
:''Battle ensues, then Zar'jira summons [[Manifestation of the Sea Witch|Manifestations of the Sea Witch]].''
:{{text|yell|Vanira|Take care of her spirits! We be handlin' Zar'jira.}}
:''Zar'jira encases Vanira and Zuni in ice, draining power from Vol'jin.''
:{{text|emote|She's drawing power from the fires! Stamp out the [[Fire of the Seas|braziers]], quickly!}}
:''Stamp the fires to break away the ice and resume the battle.''
:{{text|yell|Zar'jira|You were a fool to touch my fires! When Vol'jin falls, you know who dies next!}}
:{{text|yell|Zar'jira|Leave the fire alone, pesky trolls! Just give up and die!}}
:''After getting her low on health, she encases Vol'jin and Vanira in ice, draining power from Vol'jin.''
:{{text|yell|Zuni|I'll get the fires dis time!}}
:{{text|yell|Zar'jira|Not so fast, little troll!}}
:''Zar'jira kills Zuni, then dies shortly afterwards.''
:{{text|yell|Vanira|ZUNI! NOOOO!}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|It be done. Our ancient enemy is defeated.}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|I been waitin' a long time for a chance to avenge my father. A great weight has been lifted from my shoulders.}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|I must be returnin' ta Darkspear Hold. Please meet me there once Vanira is done with her healin' of the boy.}}
:''Vol'jin runs from the scene.''
:{{text|say|Vanira|I'm afraid there's nothin' I can do for our brother... he power tore away at his soul.}}
:{{text|say|Vanira|I'll send some watchers ta get his body so we can offer a proper farewell... I wish I could do more.}}
:{{text|say|Vanira|Vol'jin rushed off in his eagerness, but I can take us back to safety. Just give me the word when ya ready, mon.}}

Speak to Vanira:
{{Dialogue|
An ancient score is settled today.

{{gossip|Take me back to Darkspear Hold if you would, Vanira.}}

After turning in the quest:
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|Tha Sea Witch is dead, our home is reclaimed, but our future still be uncertain.}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|I've no love for Garrosh, dat much is sure, but leavin' tha Horde is not a decision I be takin' lightly.}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|Dere's only one with tha answers I seek. Ya can stay and watch if ya like.}}
:''An image of Thrall appears.''
:{{text|say|Vision of Thrall|Vol'jin. It is good to see you, brother.}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|Thrall! I am glad ya be well. Dere were rumors otherwise.}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Thrall|Indeed. Someone did try to kill me, but that is not my greatest concern at the moment. The world itself calls for my aid.}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|I must beg ya council my friend. I can't be standin' by Garrosh while he be turnin' our people against each other for the sake of war. My respect for ya does not extend to dis new Horde... I am tinkin' of leadin' my people away.}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Thrall|Vol'jin, I chose Garrosh because he has the strength to lead our people in these trying times.}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Thrall|For all my supposed wisdom, there have been moments that I've barely been able to hold the Horde together. The Wrath Gate and Undercity displayed that clearly.}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Thrall|The Horde cries for a hero of old. An orc of true blood that will bow to no human and bear no betrayal. A warrior that will make our people proud again. Garrosh can be that hero.}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Thrall|I did not make this decision lightly, Vol'jin. I know our alliances will suffer for it. I know the Horde will be irreversibly changed. But I made this choice with confidence that Garrosh is exactly what the Horde needs.}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Thrall|I'm trusting you and the other leaders to not let this divide our people. You are stronger than that.}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|I understand, brotha. I will tink on this and be troublin' ya no furtha. You have a world to be savin'.}}
:{{text|say|Vision of Thrall|Throm'ka old friend.}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|Ya be proud and strong, youngblood. Tha Darkspear will be honored ta have you fight beside de'm.}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|Dese will not be easy times, but i be suspectin' we will be stayin' with tha Horde for the good of all.}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|Thrall's words be true. Dey always be. The Horde is much more den a few old, stubborn leaders and a handful of heroes from Northrend. The people be cryin' Garrosh's name... at least for now.}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|Still, I be hopin' Thrall will return to us one day. Tha future right now be lookin' very grim... and very bloody.}}
:{{text|say|Vol'jin|Go now. Make tha Darkspear proud. Dere are many wars ahead of us, an' I'm sure ya be hivin' a part to play in all of dem.}}

After the conversation ends, players can speak to Vol'jin to watch it again from the beginning:
{{Dialogue|
I will see ta it personally dat the Darkspear rise as a power in their own right.

{{Gossip|You spoke of communing with Thrall? Did I miss it?}}
