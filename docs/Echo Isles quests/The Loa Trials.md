==Objectives==
Start the trial at the [[Altar of Darkspear Loa]].
*Participate in trial ritual

==Description==
When de [[loa]] bless the [[rush'kah]], de trials will begin. Loa be giving tasks to teach us. Once de trials start, dey don't stop for nobody!

Let's go to de altar together. [[Witch Doctor Tzadah]] will lead us in de ritual. She be [[Master Gadrin]]'s apprentice, but be showin' real initiative in helping out on the trial.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Progress==
It is time to begin de trial.

==Completion==
Dis trial be... something different, now. Normally, de loa grant visions or give tasks to teach and connect with us.

Instead, we work together to stop [[Mueh'zala]].

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Rokhan]]|Start de ritual by standing in front of de altar. De power of de loa is gathering.}}
:''The character has the {{Abilities|Wearing Rush'kah|id=448177|icon=inv_helm_armor_troll_d_01}} buff. So does Rokhan.''

Head to the loa altar. [[Witch Doctor Tzadah]] has a new gossip option:

{{Dialogue|
{{Gossip|Why aren't you wearing a rush'kah mask?}}
{{dialogue-child| 
I already wear a mask. It be made of bone, not wood, but it be workin' well for me all de same.

Master Gadrin chose [[Stranglethorn Vale]] wood for your rush'kah to appeal to de roots of [[Kevo ya Siti]] and [[Lukou]]. De feathers are also sacred. Dey adorn our raptors even to dis day. It is a good rush'kah.

But ignorin' de death loa be a bad idea, too. Dey power and wrath be strong. De bones of my mask honor dem. So, I be keepin' mine as it is.

{{Gossip|Got it.}}
}}}}

Approach the altar and use the Loa Trial Ritual extra action button to start the trial:
:''The character receives the Trial of the Loa and Necrotic Burn debuff.''
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Three effigies? Tzadah, what have ya done?}}
:''A visage of Mueh'zala appears.''
:{{Text|say|Kevo ya Siti|Mueh'zala! You are not welcome here.}}
:{{Text|say|Mueh'zala|Foolish loa! Ya don't be stoppin' me power. First I be feastin' on ya followers... den you!}}
:{{Text|say|Witch Doctor Tzadah|Mueh'zala! Make me your avatar, and the Darkspear your chosen.}}
:''Mueh'zala empowers Tzadah. Both of them disappear.''
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|We must stop Tzadah before she be takin' de power of de trial.}}
