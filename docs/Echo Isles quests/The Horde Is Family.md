==Objectives==
Escort [[Thrall]] to the [[Echo Isles]].
*Escort Thrall

==Description==
This hearthstone was part of a conversation [[Vol'jin]] and I shared a long time ago.

He believes his people are in danger. I don't know what all has transpired in my absence, but I can at least do this for my friend.

Come, <name>, travel with me to the Echo Isles. We must make sure that the [[Darkspear]] are safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]
*+250 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Vol'jin once told me the Horde is family. Indeed over the years I have come to find the troll to be like a brother to me.

==Completion==
Vol'jin has saved my life many times in the past. To see my own [[Kor'kron]] used against his people cuts deeper than I can put into words. 

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{text|say|Thrall|[[Aggra]], I should not be long. The [[Darkspear tribe|Darkspear]] are a strong people and I doubt they have much need of my assistance.}}
:{{text|say|Aggra|Take as long as you need, Go'el. If [[Vol'jin]] believes his people are in danger then you had best aid them as you can.}}
:''Thrall mounts his wolf.''
:{{text|say|Thrall|Very well my beloved. Come friend, let us ride to the [[Echo Isles|home of the Darkspear]].}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I remember when Vol'jin and I first came to [[Kalimdor|this land]]. The [[Horde]] was just an idea then. A hope. We needed one another.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|We made our home in [[Durotar|this desert]], and named it after my father [[Durotan]], Chieftain of the [[Frostwolf clan|Frostwolf Clan]].}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|The land was harsh. Time and again it was Vol'jin and his people who ensured the Horde's survival, saving us from starvation, or taking up arms when we were attacked.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|[[Troll]]s and [[orc]]s have fought together. Died together. We are family. And family looks after its own.}}
:''Past [[Sen'jin Village]], Thrall casts Water Walking.''
:{{text|say|Kor'kron Soulbreaker|Halt! This city is under Martial Law. Declare yourselves.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Have I been away so long that you have forgotten who I am?}}
:{{text|say|Kor'kron Soulbreaker|Thrall, we no longer answer to you. We have a new Warchief now. And he has reminded us that we are STRONG!}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|These are our Allies! You watch over them like they're a threat. Why? You WILL answer to me!}}
:{{text|say|Kor'kron Soulbreaker|No! Never again!}}

In case you leave Thrall, return to the Valley of Trials and speak with him again:
{{Dialogue|
It is a good thing to spend time in a place like this. We must always remember what it is we struggle so hard to protect.

{{Gossip|Ready.}}
