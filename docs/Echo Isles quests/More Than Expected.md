Vol'jin shows a vision of himself and [[Garrosh Hellscream]], the new [[Warchief]] of the [[Horde]], talking in a previous encounter in [[Grommash Hold]], using some sort of incense over a brazier.

:{{Text|say|Vol'jin|I have sometin' to show ya. It be easier to understand if ya see it yourself.}}
:''Garrosh's image appears.''
:{{Text|say|Vision of Garrosh Hellscream|Don't talk back to me, [[troll]].  You know who was left in charge here.  Haven't you stopped to ask yourself why [[Thrall]] chose me instead of you?}}
:''Vol'jin's image appears.''
:{{Text|say|Vision of Vol'jin|Dere be no question why, Garrosh.  He gave ya tha title because ya be [[Grommash Hellscream|Grom]]'s son and because tha people be wantin' a war hero.}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of Vol'jin|I tink ya be even more like ya father den ya thought, even witout da demon blood.}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of Garrosh Hellscream|You are lucky that I don't gut you right here, whelp.  You are foolish to think that you can speak to your Warchief in such ways.}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of Vol'jin|Ya be no Warchief of mine.  Ya not earned my respect and I'll not be seein' tha Horde destroyed by ya foolish thirst for war.}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of Garrosh Hellscream|And what exactly do you think that you are going to do about it?  Your threats are hollow.  Go slink away with the rest of your kind to the slums, I will endure your filth in my throne room no longer.}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of Vol'jin|I know exactly what I'll be doin' about it, son of Hellscream.  I'll watch and wait as ya people slowly become aware of ya ineptitude.  I'll laugh as dey grow ta despise ya as I do.}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of Vol'jin|And when tha time comes dat ya failure is complete and ya "power" is meaningless, I will be dere to end ya rule swiftly and silently.}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of Vol'jin|Ya will spend ya reign glancin' over ya shoulda and fearin' tha shadows, for when tha time comes and ya blood be slowly drainin' out, ya will know exactly who fired tha arrow dat pierced ya black heart.}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of Garrosh Hellscream|You have sealed your fate, troll.}}
:{{Text|emote|Vision of Garrosh Hellscream spits at Vol'jin's feet.}}
:{{Text|say|Vision of Vol'jin|And you yours, "Warchief."}}
:''Garrosh's image fades.''
:''Vol'jin's image fades.''
:{{Text|say|Vol'jin|Tha Darkspear are 'ere because I led dem here.  [[Orgrimmar]] be no home as long as it be under Hellscream's hand.}}
:{{Text|say|Vol'jin|Still, I fear I was lettin' my temper drive me ta bein' rash. Thrall devoted himself to makin' the Horde what it is, so I've no eagerness to be leavin' it on a whim.  Dis will be needin' much more thought.}}
:{{Text|say|Vol'jin|But dese be worries for older minds.  Ya still have much to learn.  Go help tha people of tha Darkspear.  I am sure we'll be speakin' again real soon.}}

After the vision ends, players can speak to Vol'jin to watch it again from the beginning.
:I will see ta it personally dat the Darkspear rise as a power in their own right.

:{{Gossip|Can you tell me of the time when the Darkspear left Orgrimmar, Vol'jin? I need to see Garrosh's actions for myself.}}
