==Notes==
Upon accepting the quest:
:{{Text|say|[[Bwonsamdi]]|A guide... You know who be good at finding lost thing? De loa of scavengers. [[Jani]].}}
:{{Text|say|[[Witch Doctor Tzadah]]|Jani? Yes! We can create a focus to attract his attention.}}
:{{Text|say|Witch Doctor Tzadah|Jani values different things than other loa. See what ya can be gathering.}}

Witch Doctor Tzadah has a new gossip dialogue option:
{{dialogue|{{gossip|What kinds of things should I choose to make a Jani tribute?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Jani be the loa of scavengers and secrets. You need to be findin' discarded things dat could be useful later or have meaning.

He be da Lord of Thieves, but you don't be needing to steal from your own tribe to impress him.

{{gossip|Got it.}}
}}}}

Collect the tributes for Jani around [[Darkspear Hold]] which include: [[Damaged Favorite Drum]], [[Overly-loved Plush Remains]], [[Warrior's First Sword]], [[Empty Bag of Marbles]], [[Abandoned Artistic Carving]], [[Half-used Dream Diary]], [[Lightly Used Pants]], and a [[Handmade Napkin]].

Upon collecting two tributes:
:{{Text|say|Master Gadrin|Dey call it trash when a thing be left behind, but we know better.}}

Upon collecting all the tributes:
:{{Text|say|Master Gadrin|Ah. Dese be forgotten, discarded, but Jani be knowing de worth.}}

Next create a Jani tribute near the [[Altar of the Loa|loa altar]]. Upon creating a Junk Pile for Jani:
:{{Text|say|Witch Doctor Tzadah|Now, we wait.}}
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|I can speed dis up a bit, as a favor.}}
:{{Text|yell|Bwonsamdi|Jani, loa of scavengers and secrets. I summon ya!}}
:''Bwonsamdi summons target the junk pile with a spell and summons Jani.''
:{{Text|say|Jani|AH! Don't just call like dat. Jani got important things to do!}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Jani, we have great need of your wisdom.}}
:{{Text|say|Jani|Jani does know many things... Troll chieftain be wise to see dat.}}

Speak to Jani:

{{dialogue|
So, what's all this den? Making contact with de loa?

Bwonsamdi not so polite, is he.

Dat is a pretty treasure pile for Jani. Very nice, very suitable. Ask your questions.

{{Gossip|quest=|We're looking for the [[Darkspear tribe|Darkspear]]'s lost loa, to combat against [[Mueh'zala]]. Can you help?}}
}}

:{{Text|say|Jani|Maybe I be knowing of one! Dig in Jani's treasure pile for the way to [[Zul'Gurub]].}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|I've done stranger things. <Name>, follow me.}}
:''Rokhan disappears inside the trash pile.''
:{{Text|say|Witch Doctor Tzadah|We be havin' de trial ready for your return.}}
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|Have fun findin' dem lost loa in de trash!}}

Rummaging inside the trash pile, suddenly the adventurer is transported to Zul'Gurub.

:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Zul'Gurub. Dere be some nasty history here.}}

Jani has new gossip in Zul'Gurub:
{{Dialogue|
Zul'Gurub be a [[Gurubashi]] area, and dere's always been a problem with de [[Hakkari]] here. Dey worship [[Hakkar the Soulflayer|Hakkar]], de blood loa, and sacrifice all sorts to dem.

De old Darkspear loa never liked blood sacrifice, so I can't imagine they be teaming up.
