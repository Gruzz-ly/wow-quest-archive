{{questportrait|Witch Doctor Tzadah empowered.jpg|Witch Doctor Tzadah|Mueh'zala has granted Tzadah immunity and extreme power.}}
==Objectives==
Collect [[Jani]]'s blessing and then travel with [[Lukou]] to the top of the pillars to defeat [[Witch Doctor Tzadah|Tzadah's]] protection totems.
*[[Jani's Blessing]]
*Travel with Lukou
*[[Tzadah's Empowerment]] destroyed (4)

==Description==
It be down to dis moment: working with our [[loa]] to save de soul of de [[Darkspear tribe|Darkspear]].

See if Jani has found anything. Hopefully, his item will let you get close enough to Tzadah's effigies to destroy dem. That should give us a chance to strike the Witch Doctor herself. I'll occupy her attention with [[Kevo ya Siti]]'s aid, but watch out for [[Summoned Visage|her guardians]]. Dey won't let you destroy her effigies without a fight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 8,500 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Progress==
Tzadah is a disgrace to the Darkspear.

==Completion==
We defeated Tzadah. She can no longer aid [[Mueh'zala]]'s attempts to escape his prison.

We could not have done this without de aid of de loa. Lukou, Kevo ya Siti, and even Jani.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{Text|say|Jani|Found it! Dis will protect ya if ya fall.}}
:{{Text|say|Lukou|Grab de feather, den we go up!}}

Before taking the feather, talk to Rokhan, Jani, and Lukou for extra gossip:

{{dialogue|title=[[Rokhan]]| Dis may not be the trial we expected, but it still be a way to connect with our true loa.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Lukou]]| I know Mueh'zala will have nasty tactics.

Are you prepared?}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Jani]]| Mueh'zala be one of the biggest bullies dere is.}}

Upon grabbing the feather:
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|I will hold her gaze. Take me up dere, Kevo ya Siti.}}
:''Rokhan and Kevo ya Siti turn into shadows and fly away to confront the Tzadah in the sky.''
:{{Text|say|Lukou|I be taking ya to break the effigies.}}

Speak with Lukou:
{{Dialogue|
It be time to fight Mueh'zala!

My leaflings will help you move around de platforms once you are up dere, if you need it.

Ready to go up?

{{Gossip|quest=|  Take me up!}}
}}

The adventurer is teleported to the top of one of the towers in the [[Darkspear Training Grounds]]. Rokhan is attacking Tzadah's barrier. Kevo ya Siti has new gossip there:

{{Dialogue|
Mueh'zala be tryin' to take over de trial? Dat will not happen.
}}

Approach the first [[Tzadah's Empowerment]] totem:
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Kill de visage, or it will not let you destroy de effigy!}}

Kill a [[Summoned Visage]] and destroy the effigy:
:{{Text|say|Witch Doctor Tzadah|Dis will make de Darkspear strong!}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|What good be strength if we sacrifice our own people?}}

The Image of Lukou is also on the platform and provides the Travel with Lukou extra action button. Upon destroying the second effigy:
:{{Text|say|Witch Doctor Tzadah|Ya be too slow. I be giving dese lives to Mueh'zala.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Listen to what ya be saying!}}

Upon destroying the third effigy:
:{{Text|say|Witch Doctor Tzadah|Ya can't break his power. It be better if ya surrender to Mueh'zala's way.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Mueh'zala's way be servitude, and death.}}

Upon destroying the final effigy, an in-game cutscene plays out:
{{#ev:youtube|u4CwF824R6E|urlArgs=start=1145&end=1174}}

:''Tzadah knocks Rokhan back.''
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|<pained grunt>}}
:''Rokhan kneels as Lukou, Kevo, and the adventurer appear near him.''
:{{Text|say|Witch Doctor Tzadah|Mueh'zala is not finished with the Darkspear.}}
:''Rokhan stands up and readies himself.''
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|We are finished with him!}}
:''Rokhan jumps at Tzadah.''
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|<battle cry>}}
:''Tzadah prepares a spell, but Rokhan disappears. He quickly materializes behind Tzadah, striking her down. As Tzadah collapses, Rokhan returns to the platform, and the dark sky clears. The loa and trolls are then teleported back to the Hold.''
