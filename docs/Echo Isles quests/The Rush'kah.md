==Objectives==
Make a [[rush'kah]].
*[[Rush'kah Paint|Paint]] mixed
*[[Prepared Wood]]
*[[Finished Rush'kah Mask|Rush'kah mask created]]

==Description==
When we make de rush'kah, we recreate de shape of the [[loa]] as we be seein' dem in our mind. By knowing the shape of de loa, we better understand who dey are. But de mask be shaped by our hands, so when de loa sees it, dey know what we expect dem to be.

If the loa don't bless the mask, we expect dem to be something dey will not be. If de loa bless de mask, dey like what we see in dem and a bargain can be struck.

We could just write a contract, but it is easier to lie with words than with your hands.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Progress==
De rush'kah be important in bonding with the loa.

==Completion==
Good work, <name>!

Almost done with mine here.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Witch Doctor Tzadah]]|Master Gadrin has prepared what ya need.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Rokhan]]|A new trial calls for new rush'kah masks.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Master Gadrin]]|We got all ya need to make de sacred rush'kah, wood, paint, and [[mojo]].}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|I did not think I would be an artist today...}}
:{{Text|emote|Bwemba laughs and winks at Master Gadrin.}}

Rokhan, Master Gadrin, and [[Bwemba]] have new gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Rokhan| De Rush'kah be sacred. Makin' dese right will honor de [[Darkspear tribe|Darkspear]].

{{Gossip|What are you infusing into your rush'kah?}}
{{dialogue-child|
De rush'kah mask be a sacred thing to de trolls. De mask dat connects us to our loa.

It be more than just wood and paint, far more.

I have felt a deep connection to [[Kevo ya Siti]], as I sense he was overlooked in shadow. I have long been in de shadow of [[Vol'jin]]. I need to be finding a way to emerge, in my own unique way, for de Darkspear.

Maybe my rush 'kah will embody this.

{{Gossip|Got it.}} 
}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Master Gadrin|
After de rush'kah masks be finished, de de{{sic}} loa be givin' you trials to complete.

Sometimes it be traveling, sometimes it be meditating, but always the trial will help you connect with both de loa and de Darkspear.

{{dialogue|title=Bwemba|
Chieftan{{sic}} Rokhan don't think he be good at dis, but the rush 'kah be crafted from de mojo and de intent.

Still, de loa like it when ya be making de mask pretty.
}}

Start working on the Rush'kah mask. Upon mixing the paint and getting the prepared wood:
:{{Text|say|Master Gadrin|Take it on over to where de Chief be paintin' his.}}

After infusing the [[Finished Rush'kah]] with mojo, the mask is done.

Upon completion:
:{{Text|say|Master Gadrin|It is time for de loa to give their blessings... and their tasks.}}
