Destroy 6 Tiki Targets.
* [[Tiki Target]] slain (6)

== Description ==
Alright, mon. We start simple. I need ta know dat you know the basics of the holy arts.

Go thrash dose tiki targets. Take it slowly. Natural-like. I'll watch how you form your casts and we'll go from dere.

== Rewards ==

Power isn't da end all of defeating ya enemy, and it most certainly isn't tha end all of stayin' alive. Fightin' is about balance. Everytin has its time and place.
