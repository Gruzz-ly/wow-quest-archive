==Objectives==
Defeat 10 Kor'kron Overseers, 5 Kor'kron Subjugators, and Gul'tar the Subjugator.
*[[Kor'kron Overseer (Echo Isles)|Kor'kron Overseer]] slain (10)
*[[Kor'kron Subjugator]] slain (5)
*[[Gul'tar the Subjugator]] slain

==Description==
The [[Kor'kron]] have been trained to be the finest, most loyal soldiers of the [[Warchief]]. Their presence here means that [[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]] fears an uprising.

[[Vol'jin]] and his people are as much a part of the [[Horde]] as any [[orc]].

We must break this occupation and free the [[troll]]s. It pains me to say this, but you must eliminate enough of the Kor'kron so that the trolls can retake their city. Then meet me at [[Darkspear Hold]] so we might challenge their officer directly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+450 [[reputation]] with [[Dominance Offensive]]
*+500 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
How did it come to this? It is as if the word "honor" is lost on these orcs.

==Completion==
The orcs have changed. My Horde has changed. Do I kill my fellow orcs until it is once again "my" Horde? Do I have any right to try force the Horde to be what it once was?

These are troubling times. But for now, I must see to Vol'jin's people.

==Notes==
The whole area is phased with [[Novice Darkspear Warrior]]s, [[Novice Darkspear Hunter]]s, [[Novice Darkspear Mage]]s, [[Novice Darkspear Shaman]], [[Novice Darkspear Druid]]s, [[Novice Darkspear Priest]]s, [[Novice Darkspear Rogue]]s, and [[Novice Darkspear Warlock]]s being captured.

[[Defiant Darkspear Citizen]]s and [[Rebellious Darkspear Watcher]]s are also present.

:{{text|yell|Kor'kron Subjugator|By order of the Warchief this "city" is now under Martial Law. Any who refuse the will of the Warchief shall be branded as traitors!}}
:{{text|yell|Defiant Darkspear Citizen|Ya not be welcome here!}}
:{{text|yell|Defiant Darkspear Citizen|You ain't got dah right to keep us captive!}}

;Aggro Gul'tar
:{{text|say|Gul'tar the Subjugator|The Horde is changing! [[Vol'jin]] refused to change with it, and he's poisoned his people.}}

;Gul'tar killed
:{{Text|say|Gul'tar the Subjugator|How... many... of your own people must you kill... so you can have "your" Horde back?}}
:{{text|say|Rebellious Darkspear Watcher|Shoulda' left when ya had the chance.}}

;Upon completion
:{{text|yell|Thrall|Sons and daughters of the Horde! Today you stand free due to the strength of your heroes and the actions of this champion, <name>! The Kor'kron arrival heralds dark times for the Horde.}}
:{{text|yell|Thrall|But know this, the Horde IS family, even if some of its leaders have forgotten that fact. To prove this, I shall remain with you and lend what strength I can to your chosen leaders until Vol'jin returns.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Please, <name>, do not tell Garrosh what we have done here today. I must make some weighty decisions before confronting him directly.}}

The rebel Darksppears have rounded a few Kor'kron. They and Thrall have comments:
{{Dialogue|title=Thrall|
Do me this courtesy, <name>, and do not share with Garrosh what has transpired here today. I could confront him directly, but I see now not all orcs share my view of the Horde.

Who am I to command their allegiance if I must become another dictator to do so?

What I can do is aid the Darkspear in fortifying their home while their heroes are abroad for the war. When Vol'jin returns, we will plan our next move.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Kor'kron Overseer|
*Hellscream will find out about this!
*These trolls cannot continue to defy the Warchief! They must be dealt with.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Kor'kron Subjugator|
We are not some mind controlled savages you are dealing with. To defy Hellscream is to defy the greatest orcs of the Horde!
}}

Near them, [[Un'Thuwa]] holds the Portal to Domination Point.

Vol'jin sends the adventurer a letter via the in-game mail system upon completion:
{{book|Darkspear Never Die|content=My Friend.

Garrosh tried to off me with a dagger to the throat. But I got me something more powerful than assassin’s poison. I got friends. You. Chen Stormstout. Thrall... We been through worse.

I need to lie low for a while. Get me head together. Chen is taking me to the [[Shado-Pan Monastery]] to heal.

Meantimes, I need you to stay close to Garrosh. Keep your eyes open. Find out what he got going on. Dangerous. But I know you can handle yourself. I seen it with me own eyes.
