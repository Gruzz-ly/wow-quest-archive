==Objectives==
Destroy Mueh'zala's altar and add Jani's.
*Destroy [[Mueh'zala]]'s [[Loa Offering|effigy]]
*Replace Mueh'zala's effigy with [[Jani]]'s

==Description==
Dat was not a traditional trial, but we only keep tradition if it be helping [[Darkspear tribe|de tribe]].

It be our strength: to adapt to what comes.

It be time to shed de past and honor those most important to us. De Darkspear was never de largest [[tribe]], nor de strongest. We endure because we choose our path, and our allies, well.

Dese [[loa]] and you all worked and sacrificed not just to help [[Bwonsamdi]], but to protect de souls of de Darkspear. Dat be why we honor our loa... and you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]
*15x [[Flightstones]] (max level)
*[[Ensemble: Heritage of the Darkspear]]
*[[Loa's Blade-Blessing]]

==Progress==
The effigies need to reflect our favored loa.

==Completion==
De Darkspear don't just serve a loa because dat loa be strong. De Darkspear serve loa who serve de tribe. Dat be what [[Lukou]], [[Kevo ya Siti]], and [[Jani]] did. So we honor them now.

De mask you made was not just for de ceremony. Take it, and de raiment of our tribe.

Wear them and know you are Darkspear.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|Oh, it be a great feelin' to see Mueh'zala's control break to bits.}}

Upon destroying Meuh'zala's effigy and replacing it with a new effigy for Jani:
:{{Text|say|Jani|Aw! A little Jani effigy! It be perfect.}}

Talking to the troll and loa gathered around [[Darkspear Hold]]:

{{dialogue|title=[[Rokhan]]| We have had quite the journey together, haven't we, <name>!}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Jani]]| Most trolls forget all about Jani. 

Jani won't be forgettin' dis day.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Bwonsamdi]]| We be havin' long road ahead, de Darkspear and ol' Bwonsamdi. But I be looking after all trolls, and more.

Ya be in good hands with Lukou and Kevo ya Siti, and I still be here when ya need me.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Lukou]]| Over the years de Darkspear lost a home, good friends, and thought dey lost de loa. Instead of shrinking, dey keep growing. Dis is Lukou's way, and I am ready to help. }}

{{dialogue|title=[[Kevo ya Siti]]| It been a long time since I heard de drums and drank de offerings from de Darkspear. Dis may not feel like home yet to us, but it will be soon enough.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Bwemba]]| Looks like Gadrin be needin' a new apprentice.

Tzadah had such promise, but it be takin' more than just talent ta lead the Darkspear. It takes heart.

Chieftan Rokhan did good. And so did you.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Morakki]]| It be a relief to feel Mueh'zala's grasp slippin' off of us.

Didn't know it was even dere til I could breathe again.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Vanira]]| We be startin' more Darkspear on de trials now. Everybody should have de chance to connect wit' de loa.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Tortunga]]| I woulda followed Lukou all dis time if I'd known she was with us. But that be impossible without knowin' her name, or dat she was hurtin'.

I was tempted by Tzadah. Tired of feelin cast off.

But I be ready to heal now, not throw it all away.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Master Gadrin]]| De tribe feels in balance. Bwonsamdi is important to us, but I been feeling something missin' since we left our old home.}}

Upon completion:
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|Bwonsamdi. Tzadah was worried dat ya were forgetting us.}}
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|I always be looking out for de Darkspear. Being de Zandalari "Loa of Kings" don't change dat.}}
:{{Text|say|Rokhan|It only took a few frightened trolls turning to Mueh'zala to be putting us all at risk.}}
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|So whatcha gonna do? Kill dem all? Ha!}}
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|Dat's not how de Darkspear work. Dat's why I let you find your own way.}}
:{{Text|say|Jani|With a little help! Hmph.}}
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|When de [[Amani tribe|Amani]], [[Drakkari tribe|Drakkari]] and even de [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] got scared, dey turned on their own in a bloody way.}}
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|When de Darkspear were scared, dey turned to their old loa. Dey found allies.}}
:{{Text|say|Lukou|We would not have joined de Darkspear if dey sacrificed their own.}}
:{{Text|say|Kevo ya Siti|We know de worth of de Darkspear.}}
:{{Text|say|Jani|Jani think so, too.}}
:{{Text|say|Bwonsamdi|Darkspear mean loyalty. Dese loa know that, and so do I.}}
