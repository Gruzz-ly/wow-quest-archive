== Objectives ==
Destroy 6 Tiki Targets.
* [[Tiki Target]] slain (6)

== Description ==
Alright, mon. We start simple. I need ta know dat you know the basics of the druidic arts.

Go thrash dose tiki targets. Take it slowly. Natural-like. I'll watch how you form your casts and we'll go from dere.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||35}}

== Progress ==
Strength isn't da end all of defeating ya enemy, and it most certainly isn't tha end all of stayin' alive. Fightin' is about balance. This'll become more apparent as ya learn animal forms, but it holds true even now. Everytin' has its time and place.

== Completion ==
Not bad, mon. Ya have a natural flow to ya casts - you may have a talent for dis.

Some rough edges ta be sure, but we'll get dose ironed out here and I'll teach ya a few new tings as we go.
