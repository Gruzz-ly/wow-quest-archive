# Troll starting experience

[[File:WorldMap-EchoIslesStart.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

Since the [[Cataclysm]], the [[Echo Isles]] have become fully reclaimed and are a starting zone for new trolls. They begin by their training and are helped along the way by [[Zuni]], but not everything is well. The [[Corrupted Bloodtalon|raptors]] are acting strangely, and the trolls will soon find their homeland threatened again. This time by the [[Spitescale]] [[Naga]], led by [[Zar'jira]] the Sea Witch. As players quest throughout the zone they develop a friendship with Zuni and eventually fight side by side with Vol'jin against Zar'jira in order put an end to the invading Naga. After a fierce battle, Zar'jira is slain but not before she is able to kill Zuni.
