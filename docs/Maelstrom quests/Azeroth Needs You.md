==Objectives==
Select your first assault point on the [[Broken Isles]].
* Initial strike point chosen

==Description==
We shaman under your command will aid your efforts against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. You may direct our actions from here.

Seek out [[Advisor Sevel]] just to the south and locate the scouting map from which you can direct your followers. We will also indicate on the scouting map various hot-spots around the Broken Isles that require your attention.

[[Azeroth]] needs you, Farseer! Visit the scouting map and choose our first point of attack.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|70}}
* 7,550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Advisor Sevel has prepared a scouting map of the Broken Isles for you. He awaits nearby.

==Completion==
A sound decision, Farseer. Behind me I have opened up an astral portal to [[Dalaran]] to help our people move quickly between our base of operations and the Broken Isles. Step through to return to Dalaran. You may always use the portal to travel back here whenever you need to augment your artifact or command your followers.

May the elements guide you, Farseer.

==Notes==
The Scouting Map is found just ahead of Nobundo.

:{{text|say|Advisor Sevel|From this map you may dispatch members of the Earthen Ring throughout the Broken Isles. Lead us to victory, Farseer!}}
Interact with the Scouting Map to choose one of four zones to quest in next. With the new zone-scaling tech, all four of the leveling zones work for 100-110 leveling:

{{Legion zone choice}}

When approaching Nobundo after choosing:
:{{text|say|Farseer Nobundo|This Astral Portal will return you to Dalaran whenever you wish, Farseer. I will keep it open so that you may return here any time.}}
