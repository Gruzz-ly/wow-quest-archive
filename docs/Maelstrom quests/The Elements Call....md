==Objectives==
Speak with [[Thrall]] and choose the [[Artifact]] you wish to pursue.
* Choose your artifact

==Description==
[[Farseer Nobundo|Nobundo]] is right. Conventional tactics will not work against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] - the [[Broken Shore]] taught us that. We must scour the world for weapons to use against the Legion!

The [[Doomhammer]] is missing and must be recovered. [[Rehgar Earthfury|Rehgar]] and [[Erunak Stonespeaker|Erunak]] have some other ideas, as well. Whatever our course, we must act immediately.

Speak with me to go over your options, but the final decision is yours!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}
*1,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you made your decision yet?

==Completion==
A good choice. There is no time to lose - let us begin!

==Notes==
Players should pick the artifact for the spec they wish to level to 110, as it will be some time before the others can be acquired.

;Enhancement
:[[Doomhammer (artifact)]] (and [[Fury of the Stonemother]])
:The Doomhammer has fallen into the [[Maelstrom]]. It would be wise to keep it from falling into the wrong hands.
:Travel with Thrall into [[Deepholm]] to pursue the missing artifact. Beware - the demon [[Geth'xun]] also plummeted into the Maelstrom and may still be alive.

;Elemental
:[[The Fist of Ra-den]] (and [[The Highkeeper's Ward]])
:The gladiator Rehgar knows of a powerful weapon that may aid us against the Legion.
:After the [[Pandaren Campaign]], the weapons of the storm god [[Ra-den]] were discovered beneath the [[Throne of Thunder]]. They were placed in the care of the [[Xuen|White Tiger]], who will give them only to one who is worthy. Rehgar will help you prove your worth!

;Restoration
:[[Sharas'dal, Scepter of Tides]] (and [[Shield of the Sea Queen]])
:It is said that [[Queen Azshara]] wielded a scepter that had command over the sea and the waters of life.
:Erunak has long sought the location of this artifact, and one of his shaman was close to finding it when she disappeared. Has she found it? Could the legends be true? What could such an artifact do in the hands of a talented shaman?

;Speaking with Thrall
{{Dialogue|
We must each choose our own path.
