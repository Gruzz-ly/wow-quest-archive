==Objectives==
Defeat [[Azerite elemental]]s and seal [[Azeroth]]'s injuries at the [[Maelstrom]].
*Defend the Maelstrom by defeating enemies and healing wounds
*[[Azerite Giant]] slain

==Description==
The [[shaman]] of the [[Earthen Ring]] are powerful, but this is more than even they can handle! And from the sound o' it, some o' their own are still trapped down below.

Like ye did in [[Nordrassil]], use yer [[:Heart of Azeroth]] tae seal up the wounds inflicted here. An' lay any crazed elementals tae rest before they make even more o' a mess.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Champions of Azeroth]]

==Progress==
This just keeps gettin' worse. If too many of these wounds open up, we may not be able tae heal the damage.

==Completion==
That was close! If ye hadn't stopped the spread of these wounds in time, I don't know what might've happened! 

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|[[Farseer Nobundo]]|Be careful when you venture deeper into the caverns. Some of us were not able to make it out in time.}}
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Nothin' our champion can't handle! We'll get yer people out o' there.}}

;Nobundo
:Never have I felt the world to be in so much turmoil. I can only image what Magni, who feels everything that Azeroth feels, is going through.
:I hope that these efforts are not too late.
:{{ClassIcon|Shaman|small}}{{gossip|What happened to the [[Doomstone]]?}}
:{{ClassIcon|Shaman|small}} Fear not, it is safe. I would not leave such a dangerous object in the wrong hands.

;Attacking the giant
:{{Text|yell|Earthen Ring Geomancer|The giant has broken loose!}}

;Defeating the giant
:{{Text|yell|Earthen Ring Geomancer|We can hold the giant for now! Hurry and save the others!}}

To fill up the bar,
*use the Heart of Azeroth extra button on the [[Azerite Wound]]s
*kill [[Azerite Borer]]s, [[Azerite Skitterer]]s, [[Crystalized Azerite]]s, and [[Hardened Azerite]]s
*interact with [[Injured Geomancer]]s and [[Overloaded Totem]]s.

;Objective completed
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Champion! The Heart of Azeroth has absorbed a massive amount of power from the Maelstrom. It's stronger than ever before!}}

;Description
The [[Earthen Ring]] is plenty capable, but this is more than even they can handle! And from the sound o' it, some o' their own are still trapped down below.

Like at [[Nordrassil]], use yer [[:Heart of Azeroth]] tae seal up the injuries inflicted here. An' lay any crazed [[elemental]]s tae rest before they make even more o' a mess.
