==Objectives==
Return to the [[Chamber of Heart]].

==Description==
Ye did it! Ye stopped the damage before it could get any worse!

The [[Maelstrom]] will always be a place o' great history an' pain fer [[Azeroth (titan)|Azeroth]], but any little bit we do will make things better. Who knows, maybe we can even heal [[Silithus]] one day!

I'll meet ye back in the Chamber o' Heart. [[MOTHER]]'s sure tae be interested in what happened here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
*[[Radiant Azerite Matrix]] (1,500 [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Completion==
Heart examination complete. Additional Azerite amplification activated.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|[[Farseer Nobundo]]|You must hurry. Though the pain of the earth lessens, I fear that there is little time left to save what remains of Azeroth.}}
:{{Text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I know, I know! We're doin' all we can an' we've enlisted some powerful help.}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Nobundo|That is good to hear. We are much stronger when we stand together. Good luck.}}

==Progression==
{{Defending the Maelstrom}}

==PTR version==
;Description
It's incredible though, don't ye feel it? The [[Heart of Azeroth|Heart]] has absorbed more of [[Azeroth]]'s vital energies via the [[Maelstrom]].

I think we should get this back tae the Chamber of Heart tae show [[MOTHER]].

I'll meet ye back there.
