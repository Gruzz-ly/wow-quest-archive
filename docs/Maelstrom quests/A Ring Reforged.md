==Objectives==
Speak with [[Farseer Nobundo|Nobundo]] and take your place as the head of the [[Earthen Ring]].
* Speak to Nobundo
* Unearth the [[Heart of Azeroth (Class Hall)|Heart of Azeroth]]

==Description==
Speak with Nobundo, and take your place around the circle, <name>. The Earthen Ring will rise again, with you as its leader!

Within these stones stands the legendary Heart of Azeroth, which we can use as a base of operations. Perhaps the power of your artifact can unseal the hidden chambers...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
* 15,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The [[Alliance]] and [[Horde]] are in chaos. If we are to save [[Azeroth]], we [[shaman]] must bind together!

==Completion==
The Earthen Ring rises once more to defend Azeroth. You will be our Farseer, <name>, and we will be your instruments. Only by working together can we preserve our world.

We are yours to command, Farseer.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Farseer Nobundo|We stand at the precipice of oblivion, but we do not stand alone. Come forward, shaman.}}
Speak with Nobundo:
{{Dialogue|
The elements have chosen you as their champion, <name>. The artifact you wield is proof.

It is your destiny to lead the Earthen Ring against the [[Burning Legion]]. We need you. Do you accept this burden?

{{gossip|Yes. I will be your Farseer!}}

:{{text|say|Farseer Nobundo|Take your place among the circle, Farseer. The Earthen Ring is forged anew, and with it, we rekindle hope for this world.}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Nobundo|You are the chosen defender of Azeroth. May your wisdom guide this circle to victory, and may the power of the weapon you wield crush those who would bring chaos to this land.}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Nobundo|Step this way, Farseer. The [[tauren]] tell of hidden chambers below that may serve as a base of operations.}}
Interact with the [[Ancient Rockslide]], opening the way to the [[Heart of Azeroth (Class Hall)|Heart of Azeroth]] - the shaman [[class hall]] - and spawning two [[Immortal Stone Protector]]s to guard the entrance.
