==Description==
[[File:Bogpaddle Bullet (Cataclysm).jpg|thumb|The Bogpaddle Bullet]]
You're quite the <race>, aren't you? Look at you... you're all grown up already. And we only just met!

I know how it'll go... soon you'll run out of things to do here at Flame Crest. You'll promise to come back. But you never will.

[[Kibler]]'s seen it all before.

When you do leave, talk to Sharon Boomgetter in the southeastern corner of the Steppes. She'll give you a ride on the bullet.

What? Oh, it's just a rocket. Perfectly safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||8}} (+{{cost||4|50}} at max level)

==Completion==
Time is money, <class>... and I've got plenty of each.

What can I do for you? 

==Progression==
