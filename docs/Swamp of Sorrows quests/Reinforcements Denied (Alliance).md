== Objectives ==
Slay 3 Stonard Warlocks.
*[[Stonard Warlock]] slain x3

== Description ==
Just killing [[ogre]]s won't be enough. The ogres themselves are being summoned onto the battlefield far too rapidly.

I need you to go far behind the enemy line and seek out their summoners. The orcs are using [[warlock]]s to bring their reinforcements in.

Cut down the warlocks, and the portals should close. There aren't many of them; a quick, surgical strike should cripple the enemy.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

== Progress ==
Is there a problem, <name>?

== Completion ==
Once again, well done. With a few more pushes the battle will be ours.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Tides of Darkness]] and [[Marking the Fallen]] before heading out. The battle has advanced phases. The corpses of footmen and warriors litter the ground, and the summoners and heavily-armored units of both sides are in play.

==Progression==
{{Assault on Stonard}}

== Patch changes ==
