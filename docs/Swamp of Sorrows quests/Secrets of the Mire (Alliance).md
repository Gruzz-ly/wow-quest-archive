== Objectives ==
Collect 10 samples of Invigorated Silt from {{NPC||Shifting Mireglob}}s.
*[[Invigorated Silt]] x10

== Description ==
The [[Shifting Mire]] takes its name from a unique phenomenon. By some force, the extremely fine silt will collect, and move on its own accord, travelling as if alive.

I originally worried this was some corrupted force, but my studies have shown the opposite; whatever energy invigorates this soil is positive in nature. Perhaps such vibrant life can be imparted onto the [[Broken]] to reawaken what they once were.

The silt may not take kindly to being collected, <name>. But please, help gather it.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

== Progress ==
Did you get those samples?

== Completion ==
It will have to be purified, but this will be most helpful. Thank you.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Prayerblossom]] before heading out.

==Progression==
