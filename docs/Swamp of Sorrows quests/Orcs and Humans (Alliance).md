== Objectives ==
Slay 8 Stonard Warriors.
*[[Stonard Warrior]] slain x8

== Description ==
With war raging across the entire world, the last thing we need is a [[Horde]] [[Stonard|settlement]] right in our backyard. [[Redridge Mountains|Redridge]], [[Duskwood]], even [[Elwynn Forest|Elwynn]] itself are all a day's march from here.

We've made the first strike, and I don't plan to give the Horde a chance to catch their breath. So consider yourself deployed. Grab a weapon, join the rest of the troops out in the [[Bloodmire]], and start killing [[orc]]s.

Report [[Marshtide Watch|back here]] after you've done some damage. I want you back alive...and that's an order. Dismissed!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

== Progress ==
I'm pretty sure you still have some slaying to do.

== Completion ==
More black on you than red... that's what I like to see. Looks like you've got what it takes, <name>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Lumbering Oafs]] before heading out. The two quests offered by {{NPC||Holaaru}}, [[The Lost Ones]] and [[Draenethyst Crystals (quest)]], are not directly connected to these, and lead to another storyline. Come back later to pick them up.

Exit town to the southwest and start killing. Pretty much anything that moves. The peons are southwest of the Bloodmire proper, closer to Stonard.

==Trivia==
"Orcs and Humans" is the full name of the first Warcraft RTS: ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]''.

==Progression==
{{Assault on Stonard}}

== Patch changes ==
