== Objectives ==
Slay 5 Stonard Peons.
*[[Stonard Peon]] slain x5

== Description ==
I want victory to be totally assured here. Having more resources isn't enough; we need to make sure the enemy has nothing.

[[Stonard]]'s forces depend on the lumber gathered from the surrounding woods. The [[orc]]ish peons that chop the lumber may not be warriors, but they still know nothing but hate for [[human]]s.

Show no mercy. I want those peons killed and the supply of lumber to Stonard cut off completely.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Helm of the Gatherer|Merciless Breastplate|Balanced Pauldrons}}
You will also receive: {{cost||80}}

== Progress ==
Have you taken care of those peons?

== Completion ==
We've had strikes on our own lumber line while you've been gone. This should at least put us on equal footing for gathering rates.

Good work, <name>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Orcs and Humans]] before heading out. The two quests offered by {{NPC||Holaaru}}, [[The Lost Ones]] and [[Draenethyst Crystals (quest)]], are not directly connected to these, and lead to another storyline. Come back later to pick them up.

Exit town to the southwest and start killing. Pretty much anything that moves. The peons are southwest of the Bloodmire proper, closer to Stonard.

==Progression==
