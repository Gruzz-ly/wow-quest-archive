[[File:I Will Not Betray My Warchief.png|thumb|"I will not betray my Warchief, troll."]]
Before accepting this quest, there is a dialogue option: "I will not betray my Warchief, troll." This prompts a warning in the game interface that it will prevent the player from completing the standard version of the quest chain and instead lead to an alternate quest ([[For the Queen]]).
