== Objectives ==
Collect 10 samples of Invigorated Silt from {{NPC||Shifting Mireglob}}s.
*[[Invigorated Silt]] x10

== Description ==
[[Helgrum the Swift|Helgrum]]'s wounds fester in the swamp air. They swell and ooze, filling his final moments with suffering. I must have something to coat them with. 

The spirits move through this mire. They inhabit the mud itself, pushing it along in clumps of fine soil that take on lives of their own.

The spirits of the cool, pure mud will offer him some comfort. Please, gather it for me, for I cannot abandon his side.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

== Progress ==
Helgrum still breathes. Do you have the mud?

== Completion ==
At least I can soothe him with my own hands while he still breathes. Thank you, <name>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Prayerblossom]] before heading out.

==Progression==
{{Death of a Friend}}
