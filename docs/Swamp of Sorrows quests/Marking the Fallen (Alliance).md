==Objectives==
Use the Banner of the Fallen to mark 7 Fallen Marshtide Footmen.
*[[Fallen Marshtide Footman|Footman]] Marked x7
*[[Banner of the Fallen (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
We've taken more than we've lost, but we've still lost too much. Too many brave have given their lives for the [[Alliance]] out there. I want to make sure they've given proper honors no matter how fierce this battle gets.

Take these flags out with you and place one on any fallen soldier you see. The protective wards on them won't offer much protection against any defilement, but it's better than nothing. I'll be able to better judge how many we've lost from a distance, as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

==Progress==
It's a grim task, I know. But one worth doing.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Those soldiers deserve better than to be left face down in the mud.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Tides of Darkness]] and [[Reinforcements Denied]] before heading out. The battle has advanced phases. The corpses of footmen and warriors litter the ground, and the summoners and heavily-armored units of both sides are in play.

==Progression==
{{Assault on Stonard}}
