==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Sharon Boomgetter}} in the southeastern corner of [[Burning Steppes]] to ride the ''[[Bogpaddle Bullet]]'' to the [[Swamp of Sorrows]]. Then speak with {{NPC||Trade Baron Silversnap}} in [[Bogpaddle]].

==Description==
[[File:Bogpaddle Bullet (Cataclysm).jpg|thumb|The Bogpaddle Bullet]]
I've heard stories about a road to the Swamp of Sorrows. Mysterious tales of a meandering mountain pathway that completely bypasses [[Redridge Mountains|Redridge]] and poops you right out into Bogpaddle!

If you run out of things to do, I suppose you'll have to leave. And we'll all be sad. When you do leave, talk to Sharon Boomgetter in the southeastern corner of the Steppes. She'll give you a ride.

<Oralius tilts his head, as if listening to something.> 

Winky? WINKY! NO!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||8}} (+{{cost||4|50}} at max level)

==Completion==
Time is money, <class>... and I've got plenty of each.

What can I do for you? 

==Progression==
