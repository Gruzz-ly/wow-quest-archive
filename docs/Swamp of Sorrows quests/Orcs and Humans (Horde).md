==Objectives==
Slay 10 Marshtide Footmen.
*[[Marshtide Footman]] slain x10

==Description==
War rages in the [[Swamp of Sorrows|swamp]], <name>. Vicious [[human]]s have [[Marshtide Watch|settled]] north of the city and brought an army to our doorstep.

There is nothing in this swamp for them. Their sole reason for coming here is to attack us, unprovoked. We will not give them the pleasure of victory!

We are undermanned and I need every able [[orc]] to take to the battlefield. Go, and slay as many humans as you can.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

== Progress ==
I'm pretty sure you still have some slaying to do.

==Completion==
We will fight to the last orc, <name>. I hope you'll keep yourself alive long enough to properly destroy these trespassers.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Lumbering Oafs]] before heading out. 

Exit town to the northeast and start killing. Pretty much anything red that moves.

==Trivia==
"Orcs and Humans" is the full name of the first Warcraft RTS: ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]''.

==Progression==
{{Assault on Stonard}}
