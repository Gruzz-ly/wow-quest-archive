==Objectives==
Collect 5 Draenethyst Crystals from the [[Fallow Sanctuary]].
*[[Draenethyst Crystal]] (5)

== Description ==
The [[Lost Ones (organization)|lost ones]] who live in the Fallow Sanctuary look as we look, but they are monsters... driven mad by the rigors of our journey to [[Azeroth]]. Once our brethren, they now live in the Fallow Sanctuary to the west, catching or killing any who wander near.

And they have stolen something sacred to us—[[draenethyst]] crystals.

We lack the force to enter the Fallow Sanctuary and reclaim our stolen draenethyst from among the huts and campfires, but without those crystals... we too may lose our way.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

==Progress==
Do you have the crystals?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. We are in your debt.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Lost Ones]] before heading out. Head north. Start killing and collecting.

==Progression==
{{Death of a Friend}}
