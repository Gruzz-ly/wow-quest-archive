== Objectives ==
Seize 5 crates of Stonard Supplies.
*[[Stonard Supplies]] x5

== Description ==
We may not be flattening [[Stonard]] into dust, but I don't want to have to go in there a second time.

I want you to gather any supplies you see in the town while you're there. Without food, they won't have any fighters after more than a day.

There should be crates scattered all over town.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|2|45}}

== Progress ==
What's the situation?

== Completion ==
Good work, <name>. With this, it's only a matter of time until the orcs are fleeing for the [[Dark Portal|portal]] or begging for surrender.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Assault on Stonard]] before heading out. The battle has advanced to its final phase. The [[Bloodmire]] is empty and Stonard is besieged by {{NPC||Marshtide Invader}}s. Help them take out the Stonard Defenders and pick up supplies in town.

While in this phase, the normal NPCs of Stonard are not visible, including the flight master and the normal Horde-side quest NPCs. This concludes the RTS reenactment.

==Progression==
