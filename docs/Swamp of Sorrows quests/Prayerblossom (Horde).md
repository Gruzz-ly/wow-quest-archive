==Objectives==
Collect 10 sprigs of Prayerblossom from the [[Shifting Mire]].
*[[Prayerblossom]] x10

==Description==
I have been ruined, <class>. I placed my strength in [[Helgrum the Swift|Helgrum]], and now it bleeds from his gaping wounds. Wounds too deep to heal, flesh that refuses to knit.

He murmurs in fear, consumed by fever and pain. I cannot leave his side. Not now. Please, I ask you in shame to gather herbs for me.

The prayerblossom that grows in the [[Swamp of Sorrows|swamp]] is an old remedy for soothing. With enough of it, his pain might be stilled.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

== Progress ==
Have you brought the prayerblossom?

== Completion ==
I will grind these and try to get him to eat. Thank you.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Secrets of the Mire]] before heading out.
