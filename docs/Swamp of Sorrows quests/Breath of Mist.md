== Objectives ==
Collect 5 Smoky Crystals from {{NPC||Misty Grell}}.
*[[Smoky Crystal]] x5

== Description ==
The [[Grell]] are forest spirits that wander the [[Misty Valley]] to the east. Though they resemble [[imp]]s, I have found no [[demon]]ic traces among the ones I've studied. They are, as far as I can tell, uncorrupted. Those that dwell in the valley move as one with the wind, summoning gusts of breeze at their whim. This pure air may be incorporated into my remedy for poor {{NPC||Magtoor}}.

Please, <name>, gather the smoky crystals found within the grells' bodies for me. I must exhaust every potential cure.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

== Progress ==
Do you have the crystals?

== Completion ==
I can only hope this will lead to a cure, <name>. Thank you for bringing it to me.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Purespring]] before heading out. The Misty Valley is in the northwest corner of the zone. Kill enough to collect 5 crystals, then head south past [[Splinterspear Junction]] to [[Purespring Cavern]] to kill water elementals. After that, circle back to the [[Harborage]].

==Progression==
{{Death of a Friend}}
