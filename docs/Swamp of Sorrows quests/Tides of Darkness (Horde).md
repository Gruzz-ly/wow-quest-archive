== Objectives ==
Slay 6 Marshtide Knights.
*[[Marshtide Knight]] slain x6

== Description ==
We have suffered many losses, <name>. [[Dreadmaul Hold]] has sent [[ogre]]s from the [[Blasted Lands]] as reinforcements, but they can only send so many; the Alliance attacks them as well, even as we speak.

The Alliance has countered our ogres with mounted [[knight]]s, a strategy that served them well in the [[Second War]]. We will need our strongest warriors to turn the tide of battle!

Return to the [[Bloodmire]], <name>, and bring down those knights!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Knight Tapper
|Bloodmire Crossbow
|Ogre Mage Staff
|Greataxe of Stonard
|Ogre Mage Club
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Progress ==
The ogres are powerful, but without help they will fall to the Alliance riders.

== Completion ==
You are a true champion, <name>, to take the lives of so many on the battlefield. I hope it will be enough to save [[Stonard]].

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Reinforcements Denied]] and [[Marking the Fallen]] before heading out. The battle has advanced phases. The corpses of footmen and warriors litter the ground, and the summoners and heavily-armored units of both sides are in play.

==Progression==
{{Assault on Stonard}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 7.3.5|note=[[Ogre Mage Club]] added as a reward.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
