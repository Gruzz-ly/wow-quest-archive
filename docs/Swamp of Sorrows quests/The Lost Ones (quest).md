==Objectives==
Slay 12 [[Lost Ones (organization)|Lost Ones]] in the [[Fallow Sanctuary]].
*Lost One slain (12)

==Description==
When the [[Dark Portal]] closed many years ago, regret and fear seized many of us who had come to [[Azeroth|these lands]]. In their despair, they cursed the name of the [[Light]], and sank into violence and hatred.

These fallen souls are now the [[Lost Ones (organization)|Lost Ones]], little more than mindless monsters, attacking all who approach. They grow more corrupt by the day, and as they die off, they have begun to kidnap from the [[Harborage]].

They are beyond help, <name>. Their suffering must end. Will you put them from their misery?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||80}}
*7,890 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Progress==
You are doing the right thing, <class>. We have hoped for years that our brothers could be saved, but our wishes have been only met with death. We can only hope to leave this land safe for those of us who have kept our minds.

==Completion==
It still pains my heart to have asked you to do this, though I know there is no other way. You have saved those of us still holding on from a terrible menace.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Draenethyst Crystals (quest)]] before heading out. Head north. Start killing and collecting.

==Progression==
