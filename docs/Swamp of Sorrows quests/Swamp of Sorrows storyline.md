The '''[[Swamp of Sorrows]]''' is a level 52-54 zone in the southern portion of [[Eastern Kingdoms]]. Breadcrumbs which lead players into the swamp comes from [[Burning Steppes]], or the notice boards in their [[Eastern Kingdoms]] major cities. 

Players start in [[Bogpaddle]], the neutral goblin quest hub found in the northeast corner of the zone. From there they aid the goblin resort town, uncover the secret behind the recent disturbance of aquatic wildlife, aid a member of the [[green dragonflight]] against the rise of [[Hakkar the Soulflayer]] in the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar]] (more commonly known as the Sunken Temple), and join the [[Alliance]]/[[Horde]] battle for [[Stonard]]. A quieter, more personal story concerning the death of a loved one finishes up the zone.

The progression of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Swamp of Sorrows Quests]].

After the Swamp of Sorrows, players are directed to the [[Blasted Lands storyline|Blasted Lands]], a 54-60 zone.

==Narrative==
===Neutral Intro===
====Chapter 1: Bogpaddle====
Adventurers of both factions were initially sent to [[Bogpaddle]], a [[Steamwheedle Cartel]] settlement established shortly after the [[Shattering]] located on the northeastern edge of the region.<ref>[[The Bogpaddle Bullet (quest)]]</ref> After arriving in Bogpaddle, the leader of the settlement [[Trade Baron Silversnap]] sent the adventurer on a variety of errands to maintain and secure the Cartel's presence there.<ref>[[Maliciously Delicious]]</ref><ref>[[Mostly Harmless]]</ref><ref>[[Croc-Out]]</ref> After Bogpaddle's immediate security was ensured, Silversnap sent the adventurer to assist [[Crazy Larry]] in determining who attacked their ships and retaliating.<ref>[[Crazy Larry (quest)]]</ref> Larry asked the adventurer to kill the [[gilblins]] that attacked their crew and return anything of value from the corpses of the fallen and their ship still parked in the bay.<ref>[[Kill Gil]]</ref><ref>[[Can't Take It With Them]]</ref><ref>[[In With a Bang]]</ref>

====Chapter 2: Temple of Atal'Hakkar====
After returning, Larry told the adventurer that Silversnap had dropped by and asked him to send the adventurer to their herbalist [[Baba Bogbrew]]<ref>[[Baba Bogbrew (quest)]]</ref> Baba told the adventurer that the murlocs and other aquatic creatures of the swamp seemed to be behaving strangely. The adventurer put some of the murlocs down<ref>[[Marshfin Madness]]</ref> and traced the strange behavior to a [[Faceless One]] [[Hr'nglth the Lost]] in a nearby cave.<ref>[[The Darkest Depths]]</ref> After the aberration was defeated, Baba sent the adventurer to speak to the green dragon [[Itharius]] who had visited her recently and was investigating the encroaching [[wind serpent]]s from the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar]].<ref>[[The Dragon and the Temple]]</ref> Itharius lamented that the [[Atal'ai]] [[troll]]s could easily corrupt and enslave him as they had corrupted other members of the [[Green Dragonflight]]. Because the mortal would not be susceptible to their methods, Itharius tasked the hero with recovering artifacts the the trolls used to corrupt the other dragons, which he would use to communicate with the adventurer inside the temple.<ref>[[Pool of Tears (quest)]]</ref> Itharius directed the adventurer through the temple to slay the leaders of the Atal'ai.<ref>[[Legends of the Sunken Temple]]</ref><ref>[[Step One: The Priestess]]</ref><ref>[[Step Two: The Bloodletter]]</ref><ref>[[Step Three: Prophet]]</ref> While [[Jammal'an the Prophet]] escaped, the defeat of the others provided Itharius the necessary security to enter the temple personally.<ref>[[Blessing of the Green Dragonflight]]</ref>

===Alliance Fork===
====Chapter 3: Battle of the Bloodmire====
After the events in the Temple, Itharius asked the [[Alliance]] adventurer to warn their faction's nearby settlement [[Marshtide Watch]] of the threat still posed by the remaining [[Atal'ai]] [[troll]]s. Upon arriving at the fort, the adventurer was informed by [[Joanna Blueheart]] that there were more pressing matters--the [[Horde]] was rebuilding the town of [[Stonard]] to the South and the Alliance needed to remove the town from area. The adventurer was immediately sent off to the ongoing battle, killing many [[orc]] [[grunt]]s and [[peon]]s.<ref>[[Orcs and Humans (Alliance)]]</ref><ref>[[Lumbering Oafs (Alliance)]]</ref>

As the battle escalated, the orc [[warlock]]s began to summon in [[ogre]]s to assist their war effort. Blueheart ordered the adventurer to thin the ogres' numbers and close the gateways the orcs used to summon them to the battlefield.<ref>[[Tides of Darkness (Alliance)]]</ref><ref>[[Reinforcements Denied (Alliance)]]</ref> Because of this, the humans gained the upper hand and were able to push into Stonard itself. The adventurer assisted the attack, crippling Stonard's defenses. Blueheart did warn the adventurer, however, that their goal was to cripple the village to make the orcs surrender, not slaughter and raze out of bloodlust or desire for revenge.<ref>[[Assault on Stonard]]</ref><ref>[[Cutting Supply]]</ref>

====Chapter 4: The Harborage====
After the battle, the [[broken]] [[Holaaru]] asked the [[Alliance]] adventurer to slay some of the [[lost one]]s that had formed a village nearby and gather the valuable crystals they were hoarding.<ref>[[The Lost Ones (quest)]]</ref><ref>[[Draenethyst Crystals (quest)]]</ref> Upon returning, Holaaru asked the adventurer to deliver the crystals to the [[draenei]] [[anchorite]] [[Anchorite Avuun|Avuun]] in the broken village of [[The Harborage]] nearby. Avuun had come to find a way to cure the broken of their affliction but was now watching over a sick friend and, Holaaru suspected, might be able to heal him with the crystals.<ref>[[The Harborage (quest)]]</ref> The crystals proved little use, so Avuun asked the adventure to gather a variety of reagents from the swamp to save his friend [[Magtoor]].<ref>[[Secrets of the Mire (Alliance)]]</ref><ref>[[Prayerblossom (Alliance)]]</ref><ref>[[The Purespring (Alliance)]]</ref><ref>[[Breath of Mist]]</ref>

Ultimately, however, none of these remedies was successful and Magtoor's condition worsened. In Magtoor's final moments, the Prophet [[Velen]] arrived through a portal from the [[Exodar]] to comfort him and the grieving anchorite. Avuun was taken aback by the prophet's compassion to not only visit a single broken in his dying moments but to do so when the Prophet likely had so many other pressing matters to attend to. Avuun swore to continue his research in Magtoor's memory as Magtoor passed into the Light.<ref>[[Remember the Light]]</ref>

===Horde Fork===
====Chapter 3: Battle of the Bloodmire====
After the events in the Temple, Itharius asked the [[Horde]] adventurer to warn their faction's nearby settlement [[Stonard]] of the threat still posed by the remaining [[Atal'ai]] [[troll]]s. Upon arriving at the town, the adventurer was informed by the town's military leader [[Dispatch Commander Ruag|Ruag]] that there were more pressing matters--the [[Alliance]] was attacking Stonard unprovoked! The adventurer was immediately sent off to the ongoing battle, killing many [[human]] [[footmen]] and [[peasant]]s.<ref>[[Orcs and Humans (Horde)]]</ref><ref>[[Lumbering Oafs (Horde)]]</ref>

As the battle escalated, the human [[mage]]s began to summon in [[knight]]s to assist their war effort. Ruag ordered the adventurer to thin the knights' numbers and close the portals the humans used to summon them to the battlefield.<ref>[[Tides of Darkness (Horde)]]</ref><ref>[[Reinforcements Denied (Horde)]]</ref> Nonetheless, the humans gained the upper hand and were able to push into Stonard itself. The adventurer assisted the defenders in driving the humans back, but the victory was likely only temporary.<ref>[[We're Under Attack!]]</ref> Ruag suspected a new offensive would come soon and asked the adventurer to gather a report from his scout [[Neeka Bloodscar]] that might help in preparing for the next siege.<ref>[[Neeka Bloodscar (quest)]]</ref>

====Chapter 4: Splinterspear Junction====
The [[Horde]] adventurer found Neeka at [[Splinterspear Junction]] to the Northwest in deathwatch over her mate [[Helgrum the Swift|Helgrum]], evidently gravely wounded in a recent [[Alliance]] attack. Neeka begged the Horde adventurer to gather a variety of reagents from the swamp to make Helgrum's last moments less painful.<ref>[[Secrets of the Mire (Horde)]]</ref><ref>[[Prayerblossom (Horde)]]</ref><ref>[[The Purespring (Horde)]]</ref>

After returning with these, Neeka asked one additional favor of the adventurer: to put down the beast [[Duskfang]] which Helgrum had sought to hunt in life but never had the opportunity to. If Helgrum's death was inevitable, the Beast's death would grant him to the opportunity to hunt it in the next world.<ref>[[Last Regrets]]</ref> After doing so, the adventurer watched Helgrum insist Neeka be strong for him as he died.<ref>[[With Dying Breath]]</ref> Neeka resolved to be strong for his sake and sent the adventurer back to Ruag with her report on the situation in the East, but omitted any mention of the tragedy her mate had suffered out of desire to not burden Ruag with additional worries.<ref>[[Ruag's Report]]</ref>
