== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Priestess Udum'bra.jpg|Priestess Udum'bra|The speaker of the Chamber of Blood.}}
Slay Priestess Udum'bra in the [[Chamber of Blood]].
*[[Priestess Udum'bra]] slain

== Description ==
[[Green dragonflight|My brethren]] are being butchered here. It's as I thought.

I must ask your help further before I enter, <name>. In the passageway outside this room, the hallway proceeds left and right. To the right, it goes down to the Chamber of Blood. Here the [[Atal'ai]] perform their dark rituals.

They have expected and prepared for my kind for years, but not for you. Enter the Chamber of Blood and slay the Priestess Udum'bra. She is one of three foul presences here that must be vanquished before I may enter.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

== Completion ==

Good riddance. Another source of corruption in this world put to rest.

I thank you for your bravery, <name>.

== Notes ==
Take two rights, then go down the steps to reach the Chamber of Blood. There are some {{NPC||Enthralled Atal'ai}} inside, and Udum'bra is at the far end of the room. She is level 54 warlock-type. Kill her to automatically complete the quest.
