== Objectives ==
Slay 8 Sawtooth Crocolisks.
*[[Sawtooth Crocolisk]] slain x8

== Description ==
The [[Stagalbog]] east of town is swarming with [[crocolisk]]s. Swarming, you hear me? I've sold every bit of crocolisk you could imagine.

Crocolisk hides, teeth, tails, tongues, eyes, you name it. My point is, they ain't sellin' anymore. There's too many crocs! We're over-supplied and under-demanded.

So since they're of no use to me, and they occasionally eat my guests, I need you to just kill the suckers. Do me the favor, eh? I'll be here negotiatin' things with your people.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

== Progress ==
Don't try to pull a fast one on me, pal. I know croc like nobody else.

== Completion ==
All taken care of? Good to hear. Takes a load off my mind.

Now I can focus on proper business for the fine folk of [[Marshtide]] and [[Stonard]], weary from the war... and all that junk.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Mostly Harmless]] and [[Tastes Like Strider]] before heading out. West of the landmines and striders are lots of crocolisks.
