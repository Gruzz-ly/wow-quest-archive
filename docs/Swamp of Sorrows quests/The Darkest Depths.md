== Objectives ==
Slay Hr'nglth the Lost.
*[[Hr'nglth the Lost]] slain

== Description ==
I've been seeing sea creatures acting oddly through the whole swamp. The [[murloc]]s yes, but before that the [[gilblin]]s, and the [[makrura]]... I even saw some [[naga]] wander ashore the other day.

Something's calling them here, and working them into a frenzy to boot. Many of the creatures have been drawn to [[Stagalbog Cave|Stagalbog Cavern]] to the west. Something's down there, and if it gets any stronger we'll all start wandering in there too...

You should put a stop to whatever it is before that happens.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Baba's Leg Warmers|Frenzy Call Vest|Swamp Skull Cap|Sinister Belt}}
You will also receive: {{cost|1|60}}

== Progress ==
Getting cold feet?

== Completion ==
Oh my. It sounds like you ran across quite a sinister being. I wonder what one of those was doing all the way out here...

== Notes ==
Head just west and enter the cave. Then clear a path to the bottom through a huge quantity of enthralled aquatic-type hostiles... At the southern end of the cave is Hr'nglth the Lost, a level 53 [[faceless one]]! He has 4906 health.

On aggro:
