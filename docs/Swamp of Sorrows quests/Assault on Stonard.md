== Objectives ==
Slay 6 Stonard Defenders.
*[[Stonard Defender]] slain x6

== Description ==
This is it, <name>. We've made our final push into [[Stonard]] itself.

I shouldn't have to remind anyone, but I'll say it anyway: We're not [[orc]]s, and we're not going to become them out of revenge or spite. Stonard will not be burned to the ground for us to dance on the ashes.

No, I want this done right. I want this surgical. Hold your head high and strike down any orc that picks up a weapon.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Surgical Striker|Robes of the Honorable|Leggings of the Final Assault|Chestguard of Bravery|Blueheart's Helm}}
You will also receive: {{cost|2|45}}

== Progress ==
Remember what I said, <name>. Surgical.

== Completion ==
You've followed orders well, <name>. On behalf of the crown, I'm rewarding you for your bravery on the battlefield.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Cutting Supply]] before heading out. The battle has advanced to its final phase. The [[Bloodmire]] is empty and Stonard is besieged by {{NPC||Marshtide Invader}}s. Help them take out the Stonard Defenders and pick up supplies in town.

While in this phase, the normal NPCs of Stonard are not visible, including the flight master and the normal Horde-side quest NPCs. This concludes the RTS reenactment.
