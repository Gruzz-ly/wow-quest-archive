==Objectives==
Find out more about what is happening in the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|Temple of Atal'Hakkar]].
*Explore the Sunken Temple

==Description==
In its day the so-called Sunken Temple was home to a sect of [[Jungle troll|trolls]] dedicated to the resurrection of their ancient blood deity, [[Hakkar the Soul-Flayer]]. Before the [[Atal'ai]] could realize their grim ambitions, [[Ysera]]'s wrath smote the temple into the mire and she left the [[Green dragon|dragon]] [[Eranikus]] and his host as its guardians. Of late I have heard many whispers of trolls once again active there, and I fear what may have become of the dragons there.

Please, venture inside the temple and see what you can learn.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|45}}
*5900 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with the [[Emerald Wardens]]

==Progress==
What news do you bring of Eranikus?

==Completion==
The scene you described is most harrowing. This is far worse than I feared. I can only hope that some of the dragons there yet live and can be rallied.

==Notes==
The quest objective is completed by entering the [[Lair of the Chosen]] subzone within the temple.

==Progression==
{{An Amalagamation of Nightmares}}
