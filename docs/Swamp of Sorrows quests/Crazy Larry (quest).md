== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Crazy Larry}} to the southeast of [[Bogpaddle]].

== Description ==
You're gettin' it, <name>. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Well, more like I scratch the back of your whole army, and just a little harder than the backs of the other side. Was that too complicated?

What I'm sayin' is, that's a lot of backs. So I'm gonna have to ask you to scratch mine a few more times. Whoever stole those landmines may have just hit our boys on the eastern shore.

Head to our camp to the southeast and check on Crazy Larry; he'll fill you in when you get there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

== Completion ==
{{NPC||Trade Baron Silversnap||Silversnap}} sent you?! I'm DOOMED!

Oh, he sent you to help me! That's different, haha!

== Notes ==
Run southeast along the shore. Crazy Larry's camp is at the southern end of the northern peninsula of the [[Swamp of Sorrows]] in [[Sorrowmurk]].

==Progression==
