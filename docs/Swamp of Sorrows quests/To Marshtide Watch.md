== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Joanna Blueheart}} at [[Marshtide Watch]].

== Description ==
Regardless of whether you assist me within [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar|the temple]], your people must be told of what is brewing here.

North of the temple, [[human]]s of your mortal [[Alliance]] have built what they call Marshtide Watch. They war with the [[Horde]] across the swamp, a raging conflict that I foresee only worsening.

It is not my role to interfere in [[mortal]] affairs, <name>. I simply ask you bring warning to your people of what lurks within the temple.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

== Completion ==
Trouble within the temple... I wish we could spare forces to deal with it. The war with [[Stonard]] is already raging, and we need every man we can get.

== Notes ==
Exit the temple and swim north to reach Marshtide Watch.

Joanna Blueheart has some interesting gossip text:
:This land is where orcs and humans first spilled each other's blood. Not a mile south lies Stonard, where the orcs first grouped to invade our lands.
:It was here they amassed their armies before we even knew they existed. It was here that they started the first of three wars with their attack on a small Alliance town to the west.
:My town. The town where my parents died to save me.
:But I'm not here to settle a grudge... I'm here to win a war.
