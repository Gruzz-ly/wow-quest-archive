== Objectives ==
Slay Gomora the Bloodletter in [[The Butchery]].
*[[Gomora the Bloodletter]] slain

== Description ==
The [[troll]]s here perpetuate the fall of [[green dragonflight|my brethren]] to the [[Emerald Nightmare|nightmare]]. They infect and corrupt green dragons with the blood of their [[Hakkar the Soulflayer|foul god]], and then harvest the evil that has grown within them. They are being farmed like livestock...

This disgusting savagery cannot continue. Return to where you left the [[Hall of Masks]] and take the other corridor towards the Butchery. Gomora the Bloodletter harvests corpses for these foul and evil rituals there. Take his undeserved life from him!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

== Completion ==

A deserved fate. You will not find the pacifism of the [[red dragonflight]] among my kin, <name>; we will not suffer the intrusions of [[mortal]]s.

== Notes ==
Back up the steps, then down the first flight of steps. Turn left. Gomora is just inside the room to the north, the Butchery. He is a level 54 troll with 5066 health. Kill him to automatically conclude the quest.

==Progression==
