== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Lord Itharius}} atop the outer steps of the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar]].

== Description ==
These [[wind serpent|serpents]] must be from the Temple of Atal'Hakkar. I already had a hint...

Not a few days ago, I had a visitor stop by and ask me to keep an eye out for such things. An [[high elf|elf]] by the name of Itharius. I'm sure he didn't think I could see through his form... he was a [[green dragon]] in disguise, come here to help his fallen brothers no doubt.

He may very well be on to something. Itharius left for the temple itself. Perhaps you'd better go look for him there. Dark things are afoot.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

== Completion ==
The [[goblin]] sent you? {{NPC||Baba Bogbrew||She}} has a cunning eye, that one.

She speaks the truth. I am here to stem the tide of corruption seeping from this temple. If you would save your people from a wicked fate, <name>, I ask for your assistance.

== Notes ==
Run north, through the [[Pool of Tears]] up the steps of the Sunken Temple. Itharius is waiting at the top, near the [[Meeting Stone]].
