== Objectives ==
Collect [[Duskfang]]'s Hide.
* [[Duskfang's Hide]]

== Description ==
If I am reduced to groveling, I may as well ask everything I can. There is one last favor I would ask of you, one more task a shamed [[orc]] pleads for.

[[Helgrum the Swift|Helgrum]] had a prized prey. Duskfang, eater of ogres, the great panther of [[Misty Valley]]. He would never allow himself the leisure of stalking it. Though he wanted badly to hunt, our scouting duties were too important.

If he cannot hunt Duskfang in this world, he can hunt the beast in the next. Take up the hunt for him; bring Duskfang's pelt to me.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

== Progress ==
Has Duskfang shown himself?

== Completion ==
With Duskfang to shroud his body, he will carry the animal's spirit with him into the afterlife.

Listen to me. An old superstitious fool. I'm so sorry, Helgrum...

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Breath of Mist]] before heading out. The water elementals of Purespring Cavern are just to the south. [[Duskfang]] is in the very back of [[Misty Valley]] to the north, in a cave.

==Progression==
{{Death of a Friend}}
