==Objectives==
Help [[Anchorite Avuun]] say farewell to [[Magtoor]].
*Magtoor passed on

==Description==
Magtoor grows weaker by the second, <name>. My remedy is prepared... it must work. It must!

You have done so much for the both of us. I would be honored if you stayed for what may be Magtoor's final moments.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|65}}

{{itembox|You will also receive:|Light's Embrace}}

==Completion==
I am moved, <name>. [[Prophet Velen]] has been in closely guarded seclusion. He has dared not waste his energy on anything save preparing for the [[War between light and shadow|final confrontation]] he has foretold.

And yet, he came here, in person, to comfort a single dying soul.

I must thank you as well, for helping me make my last effort to comfort my friend. My research will continue... and I hope that Magtoor will continue to watch over me.
