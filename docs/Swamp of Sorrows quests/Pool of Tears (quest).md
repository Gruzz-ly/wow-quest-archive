== Objectives ==
Collect 5 Atal'ai Artifacts from the [[Pool of Tears]] surrounding the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar]].
*[[Atal'ai Artifact]] x5

== Description ==
The [[troll]]s that lurk within this temple have done grievous harm to my kind, <name>. We were sent here to guard this place, and were instead used to unleash the terrible powers within.

I must beg you for the help only a [[mortal]] can give. You can be my hand within the temple; should I enter by myself, I risk being turned against my brothers as well.

We shall make a pact. If you wish to help, first gather [[Atal'ai]] artifacts from the waters around the temple, and return them to me.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

== Progress ==
Your gathering of these artifacts will be a sign of faith. Once rendered, I will perform the ritual.

== Completion ==
The essence of the [[green dragonflight]] wafts from these artifacts; the vestiges of my corrupted kin. In purifying them, I form a bond between us.

Step forward, <name>, and receive the Oathstone of {{NPC||Ysera}}'s Dragonflight.

== Notes ==
Go swimming. The artifacts are on the bottom of the lake. They are very small, and the sparkles are hard to see in the murky water.

==Progression==
{{The Sunken Temple}}
