== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Lord Itharius}} atop the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar]].

== Description ==
You have done well, <name>. {{NPC||Jammal'an the Prophet||Jammal'an}} may have escaped our grasp, but his retreat paves the way for me to enter the temple as I desire.

Stay where you are and do not move. I will hasten your return by pulling your spirit to me through the [[Emerald Dream]].

This may cause slight drowsiness.

("Return to me for your reward.")

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Dream Amulet|Dream Pendant|Dream Medallion}}
You will also receive: {{cost|1|65}}

== Completion ==
You have performed a great service for me and [[green dragonflight|my kind]], <name>. Accept this as a symbol of my gratitude, and of your courage.

== Notes ==
Accept the quest and Itharius will teleport the player back to him, saving the run back up to the surface.

The storyline forks after this point: Itharius wants to go inside the temple proper, but that requires a party. [[The Heart of the Temple]] starts the new [[Sunken Temple]] storyline.

If not willing to go dungeon-crawling right away, he will also send players to their primary faction hub of [[Marshtide Watch]] for the Alliance or [[Stonard]] for the Horde to continue the Swamp of Sorrows storyline.

==Progression==
