== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Intact Swampshore Tails from {{NPC||Swampshore Makrura}}.
*[[Intact Swampshore Tail]] x6

== Description ==
You know, I've got a problem you might be able to help me out with, here.

See, in addition to the fine pursuit of arms dealing, I'm trying to liven up the entertainment here in [[Bogpaddle]]. Apparently there's a bunch of these [[makrura]] things in the north waters that don't take kindly to the wild beach parties we've been throwing.

Joke's on them. I'm not gonna be pushed around by giant lobsters; they're my next source of revenue! You bring me some of their tails and we'll turn a problem into a profit.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

== Progress ==
You got those tails? Don't be tryin' to push no hacked-up ones on me!

== Completion ==
I can see it now: our own famous Bogpaddle Lobster-Poppers! Made fresh from the sea! Oh, it's like this stuff writes itself...

Your help is very much appreciated, my friend. I'll start seeing if I can't cut your people a favorable arrangement, eh?

== Notes ==
Run north and pick up [[Drinks on the Rocks]] from {{NPC||Brono Goodgroove}} before heading out.

==Progression==
