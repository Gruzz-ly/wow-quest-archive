== Objectives ==
Defeat Jammal'an the Prophet.
*[[Jammal'an the Prophet]] defeated

== Description ==
All that yet stands between me and the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar|temple]] is Prophet Jammal'an himself. He is the leader of the [[Atal'ai]] [[troll]]s here, a foul manipulator.

Know that you do not face a mere crazed troll, <name>, but an instrument of forces beyond your darkest comprehension. Yet you do not fight alone; my strength and the will of the [[Green Dragonflight]] go with you.

Proceed to the [[Den of the Caller]], left through the [[Hall of Ritual]], and then down into the [[Hall of Bones]]. At the bottom, you will find Jammal'an.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

== Completion ==

He has escaped! I should have known it would not be so easy.

The path is clear, <name>. It is time to return.

== Notes ==
Continue heading down, following Itharius's instructions. Take a left and follow the hall east, then north to enter the Hall of Ritual, which is filled with Cursed Atal'ai, Mummified Atal'ai, and Atal'ai Priests. After the Hall of Ritual, continue north, then west and down the steps to reach the Hall of Bones. Murk Spitters and more Mummified Atal'ai await. Jump down to the lowest level to encounter Jammal'an. He is a level 54 troll with only 2533 health, but don't be fooled. Knock him down to a quarter health and he will teleport away:

Defeating him will complete the quest automatically.

== Trivia ==
The quest title is a reference to South Park's "Step Three: Profit," described at http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepThreeProfit as "An ill-conceived Get Rich Quick Scheme that lacks the "scheme", or at least a well thought out one."
