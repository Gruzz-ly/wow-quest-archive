You never seen a gilblin before? They're crazy! Crazier than me! I just blow stuff up for a living, these guys are WHACKED!

Dunno where they came from, but they're like awful fish [[goblin]]s! Gills and everything! They wiped out all my men down at the beach, and they took our [[Fortune's Fist|shipping freighter]]!

You gotta help! They're just down to the east, go on and get rid of those gilblins!
