== Objectives ==
Deliver the [[Draenethyst Crystals (item)]] to [[Anchorite Avuun]].

== Description ==
Anchorite Avuun is one of our uncorrupted brethren, what other races know as [[Draenei]]. He came to the [[Harborage]] to heal us, and try to find a cure. It is he who sent me here to collect these crystals.

He watches over a very sick friend now... and despite sending word to the [[Exodar]] itself, he has not found any aid so far. Could you bring these crystals to him, <name>? You may be the only one able to assist him.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

== Completion ==
Thank you, <class>. I am afraid it may be too late... but I refuse to give up, even if the Exodar itself does not hear my cries.

== Notes ==
Run north and follow the path west to the Harborage, in the northwest part of the zone. 

==Progression==
{{Death of a Friend}}

== Patch changes ==
