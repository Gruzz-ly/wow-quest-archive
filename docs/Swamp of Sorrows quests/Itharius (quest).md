==Objectives==
Seek out Itharius somewhere in the Swamp of Sorrows.
*Seek out [[Itharius]] in the {{C|Swamp of Sorrows}}

==Description==
Are you familiar with the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|Temple of Atal'Hakkar]]? It has a storied history that I will not retell here, but it is currently under the stewardship of a host of mighty [[green dragon]]s. The chief guardian of the temple is a great dragon named [[Eranikus]], and he is known to be particularly attuned to [[Emerald Dream|the dream]]. It is my hope that he may be able to aid us. Go to the Swamp of Sorrows and meet with the ranger there known as Itharius. He may know how to reach out to Eranikus to petition his aid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||75}}
*4700 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with the [[Emerald Wardens]]

==Progress==
Greetings, <race>.

==Completion==
You come seeking Eranikus? Your coming may be ill-timed, <class>. I fear something is amiss at the Temple of Atal'Hakkar. Come, let us speak further.
