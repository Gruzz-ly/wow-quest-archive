==Objectives==
Talk to [[Lil' Crazy Daisy]] to take a cannon ride to [[Baba Bogbrew]].

==Description==
Hey, while you were out, the {{NPC||Trade Baron Silversnap||Baron}} stopped by! He kicked me until money came out!

He always does that though. But this time he asked me to tell you something! He wants you to go south and help out our herbalist, Baba Bogbrew.

She's all the way across the water! But just talk to my girl Daisy outside and she'll send you there the [[Crazy Larry]] way!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Completion==
Ah, it's so nice to have help dropped in.

Modern convenience... I can't get enough of it.

==Notes==
Exit camp and turn left this time. This cannon shoots players all the way across the zone to its southern border with the [[Blasted Lands]], between [[Stonard]] and what's left of [[Misty Reed Post]] in the [[Stagalbog]].

==Progression==
{{Bogpaddle}}
