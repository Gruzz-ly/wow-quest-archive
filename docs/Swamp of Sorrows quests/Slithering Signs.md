== Objectives ==
Collect 5 Intact [[Stagalbog Serpent]] Hearts.
*[[Intact Stagalbog Serpent Heart]] x5

== Description ==
I settled here well before [[Bogpaddle]] was founded, to brew my potions and find some peace and quiet. I know this swamp like the back of my old, gnarly hand.

There's been a change in the wildlife recently. Those winged snakes you may have seen in the [[stagalbog]] are [[wind serpent]]s, and they haven't been seen around here for ages.

They're also prime for ingredients if they're the kind I'm thinking of. Be a dear and gather me some of their hearts, will you?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

== Progress ==
Don't be squeamish now.

== Completion ==
Let's have a look then...

Mmm, oh dear. That's what I thought these were. They might still be useful, but it's horrid to have such things in my backyard.

== Notes ==
Head east, kill and loot any five, then return.

==Progression==
{{The Sunken Temple}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
