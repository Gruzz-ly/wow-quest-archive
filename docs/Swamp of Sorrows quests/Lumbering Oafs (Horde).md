==Objectives==
Slay 5 Marshtide Peasants.
*[[Marshtide Peasant]] slain x5

==Description==
We are outnumbered by the [[Alliance]]. In their fear they send an army to crush a [[Stonard|single settlement]]. But we will not give!

Without resources, their soldiers will be at a disadvantage. [[Human]] peasants busy themselves in the woods outside [[Marshtide Watch]], gathering lumber to rebuild their crumbling walls.

Deny them the wood, and their lives.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Helm of the Gatherer|Merciless Breastplate|Balanced Pauldrons}}
You will also receive: {{cost||80}}

==Progress==
If you have a complaint about killing peasants, <race>, give me a moment to spit in disgust.

==Completion==
No true member of the [[Horde]] should find pleasure in killing such terrified weaklings... without challenge, victory has no true thrill.

But your dirty work has helped stave off the Alliance and protect our homes here. Be proud of your work for the Horde. 

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Orcs and Humans]] before heading out. 

Exit town to the northeast and start killing. Pretty much anything red that moves. The peasants are on the north side of the Bloodmire, closer to Marshtide Watch.

==Progression==
{{Assault on Stonard}}
