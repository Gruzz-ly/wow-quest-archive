== Objectives ==
Journey through the antechambers of the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar|temple]] to the [[Hall of Masks]].
*Hall of Masks found

== Description ==
I will need you to enter the temple first, <name>. I can join you once a path is secure, but I dare not enter blindly. Turned against my kind, I would be a vicious enemy.

You can start by descending the stairs behind me. Then, swim through the flooded depths of the [[Broken Hall]]. Once there, follow the passageway to the right to find the Hall of Masks.

Beware of any temple guards. Once you have found the Hall of Masks, I will contact you through the Oathstone.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

== Progress ==
You must not falter, <name>. Your actions will pave the way for me to enter the temple myself.

== Completion ==
{{questportrait|Lord Itharius.jpg|Lord Itharius|You've found it!}}
This is it!

These are the bones of my kin...

== Notes ==
Follow Itharius's directions. There are no hostiles inside. Upon reaching the Hall of Masks and the new instance line, guarded by Corrupted Guardians, the quest completes automatically. Click on the quest in your log to turn it in.

The quest name alludes to the Nickelodeon show {{wplink|Legends of the Hidden Temple}}.
