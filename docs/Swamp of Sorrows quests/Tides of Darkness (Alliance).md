== Objectives ==
Slay 6 Stonard Ogres.
*[[Stonard Ogre]] slain x6

== Description ==
The battle's proceeding just the way I wanted it. With their warriors nearly exhausted, I've sent in our cavalry.

What I wasn't expecting was [[ogre]]s. Our [[knight]]s are well-matched against the brutes, but they're going to need help.

I need you back on the field right away, <name>. Few can bring down an ogre on foot, but I think I can count on you. Don't disappoint me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ogre Tapper
|Bloodmire Crossbow
|Ogre Mage Staff
|Sword of Marshtide Watch
|Ogre Mage Club
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
There's still too many out there. Those knights need help.

== Completion ==
Going toe to toe with ogres is impressive, <name>. I'm glad I've got soldiers like you out there.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Reinforcements Denied]] and [[Marking the Fallen]] before heading out. The battle has advanced phases. The corpses of footmen and warriors litter the ground, and the summoners and heavily-armored units of both sides are in play.

==Progression==
{{Assault on Stonard}}

*{{Patch 7.3.5|note=[[Ogre Mage Club]] added as a reward.}}
