==Objectives==
Return to [[Loganaar]] in [[Moonglade]].

==Description==
Return to Loganaar and inform him of what we've learned. I'm going to try and scout [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|the temple]] myself to hopefully make contact with the [[Green dragon|dragons]], or at least glean more information.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35}}
*2350 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with the [[Emerald Wardens]]

==Completion==
<Loganaar sighs heavily>

More bad news. Very well, I thank you for risking your life to enter the temple to learn what you did, and for bringing word back to me. I must inform the other [[druid]]s so that we may determine what to do next.

Thank you for now. I may call upon you again in the future.
