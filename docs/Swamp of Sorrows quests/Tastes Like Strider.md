You there! Yes, you! You want a good word put in with the {{NPC||Trade Baron Silversnap||Trade Baron}}? Give me a hand!

I heard you're the one that [[Maliciously Delicious|got all those makrura tails]]. They're wonderful, but not enough for proper swamp food. I need drumsticks for my gumbo!

Have you got those drumsticks?

Ah, good, good! Just what I needed.
