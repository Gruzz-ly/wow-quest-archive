== Objectives ==
Collect 8 Stolen Land Mines from the [[Sorrowmurk]] to the east of [[Bogpaddle]].
*[[Disarmed Land Mine]] x8

== Description ==
Here's another favor you can do for me, pal.

We had a whole shipment of Landmines come in from [[Booty Bay]] just the other day. But someone stole the whole lot of 'em in the night!

Whoever it was must be sloppy, because they dropped them all over the swamp to the east. No [[goblin]] I know would be that careless.

I need you to go gather those landmines up for me. I'm sure they're perfectly safe and disarmed. Every single one. Yup.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Bogpaddle Leggings|Sloppy Spaulders|Armed Gauntlets}}
You will also receive: {{cost||75}}

== Progress ==
Hey, you get those things I asked you about?

== Completion ==
What did I tell you, eh? Perfectly safe!

I'll see about getting some of these over to your friends, <name>. At a discount.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Croc-Out]] and [[Tastes Like Strider]] before heading out. Do ''not'' carelessly run over the landmines! They ''will'' explode. Carefully walk up to them and right-click as soon as the cog lights up.
