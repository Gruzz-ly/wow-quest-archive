== Objectives ==
Collect 10 bottles of Stolen Silversnap Ice from {{NPC||Silt Crawler}}s.
*[[Stolen Silversnap Ice]] x10

== Description ==
What's up, "bro"! We were just in the middle of our completely spontaneous beach party when something terrible happened, "dude"!

I had a whole case of Silversnap Ice, the {{NPC||Trade Baron Silversnap||Baron's}} own drink of choice, until the silt crawlers stole them! I've never seen crawlers drink, but they took them right into the water and down the beach! We need some sort of awesome hero who can help retrieve our specifically-branded favorite beverage!

<Brono stares at you a moment.>

That means you, "brah"!

You got the goods, "bro"?
