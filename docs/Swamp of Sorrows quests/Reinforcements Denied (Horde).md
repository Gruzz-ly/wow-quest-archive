== Objectives ==
Slay 3 Marshtide Mages.
*[[Marshtide Mage]] slain x3

== Description ==
The [[Alliance]] has brought in their [[mage]]s to summon more reinforcements directly to the battlefield from beyond their fortress. This must be stopped!

Their numbers are few, but a single portal can turn the tide of battle. Attack their mages and shut off those portals! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

== Progress ==
Is there a problem, <name>?

== Completion ==
With no link to the outside, the Alliance must rely on what they've brought to the swamp. We shall see if they can handle our environment.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Tides of Darkness]] and [[Marking the Fallen]] before heading out. The battle has advanced phases. The corpses of footmen and warriors litter the ground, and the summoners and heavily-armored units of both sides are in play.

==Progression==
{{Assault on Stonard}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
