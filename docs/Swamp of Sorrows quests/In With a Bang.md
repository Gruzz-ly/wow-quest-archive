==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lil' Crazy Jerry]] to board the [[Fortune's Fist|ship]], then retrieve all three of [[Crazy Larry]]'s important goods.
*[[Thousand-Thread-Count Fuse]]
*[[Extra-Pure Blasting Powder]]
*[[Stack of Questionable Publications]]

==Description==
Our trade frigate's still all the way out there on the water, swarming with [[Gilblin]]s! AHH!

Sorry about that. But really! We need a way to get you out there and get back our stuff. There's quality goods left on that ship! QUALITY! LIKE MY MIDDLE NAME!

Lucky for you, I have an idea! Head right outside the camp and check along the north wall... my son Jerry'll get you over there with [[The Baron's Cannon|our cannon]]! If he's been practicing, that is!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Almost New Shoulderpads|Expensive Tunic|Imported Helmet|High-Grade Greaves}}
You will also receive: {{cost|1|55}}

==Progress==
You got it? Did you get it? Did you try the cannon? You didn't explode!

==Completion==
My high-grade fuse! My imported blasting powder!

And my—hellow there! I'll just be taking that!

Those are all worth more gold than what you're wearing, you know! Thanks for your help!

==Notes==
If you want an easier swim back, make sure you have a [[Silversnap Swim Tonic]] from [[Trade Baron Silversnap]] before leaving in the cannon.

Head outside and talk to Jerry to take a cannon ride. It will set you right on the ship, giving the [[Going Down?]] achievement if you do not already have it. Warning: if you use [[Slow Fall (ability)]] or a similar spell during the cannon ride, you will drift out into deep water and probably die from [[fatigue]].

Once on the ship, take out the Gilblin Tresspassers and Slashers and head to the bow of the ship. The Thousand-Thread-Count Fuse is just behind the main mast near the bow of the ship topside. Then turn back and head below deck.

The Extra-Pure Blasting Powder is in the captain's quarters, on the mid-deck, aft. Further down, the Stack of Questionable Publications is aft in the hold on the bottom deck.
