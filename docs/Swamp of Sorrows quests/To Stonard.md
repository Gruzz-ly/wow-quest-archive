==Objectives==
Speak with [[Dispatch Commander Ruag]] at [[Stonard]] in [[Swamp of Sorrows]].

==Description==
Regardless of whether you assist me within [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar|the temple]], your people must be told of what is brewing here.

Southwest of the temple is the [[Horde]] town of Stonard. The [[orc]]s there wage war with the new [[human]] arrivals to the swamp, a raging conflict that I foresee only worsening.

It is not my role to interfere in mortal affairs, <name>. I simply ask you bring warning to your people of what lurks within the temple.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Completion==
We have no time to send orcs to the temple, <name>. The humans come, and they are many. Stonard must be defended!

==Progression==
{{The Sunken Temple}}
