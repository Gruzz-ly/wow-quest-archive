==Objectives==
Use the Banner of the Fallen to mark 7 [[Fallen Stonard Warrior]]s.
*Fallen Stonard Warrior marked (7)
*[[Banner of the Fallen (quest item)#Horde]] (provided)

==Description==
Many warriors have met death to bring us victory, <name>. The fate of a true [[orc]].

I have seen the way the [[Alliance]] loots the bodies of our fallen, clutching at our goods like packrats. They will not defile our fallen heroes on this field.

Take these wards with you to the [[Bloodmire]]. Place them on the bodies of our fallen warriors. I will be watching, to see how many have fallen, and to honor their sacrifice. Let us hope the spirits give us aid for our respect.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||80}}

==Progress==
The spirits will watch over us, <name>.

==Completion==
You honor both the dead and the living with your courage, <name>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Tides of Darkness]] and [[Reinforcements Denied]] before heading out. The battle has advanced phases. The corpses of footmen and warriors litter the ground, and the summoners and heavily-armored units of both sides are in play.

==Progression==
{{Assault on Stonard}}
