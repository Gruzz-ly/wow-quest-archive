== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Purespring Motes from [[Purespring Elemental]]s.
*[[Purespring Mote]] x6

== Description ==
[[Magtoor]] has told me of the [[shamanism]] that the [[Broken]] practice. The great [[Nobundo]] once said that the path of the elements may, in a way, be another way to the [[Light]].

I can only hope there is some truth in this. The [[elemental]]s that gather near [[Purespring Cavern]] are a source of truly pristine water. They can be chaotic and violent, but the pure water harvested from them will be the perfect conduit for the blessing of the Light.

Please, bring me this water, <name>.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

== Progress ==
Have the elementals given up their source?

== Completion ==
Such clarity... let us hope this will aid poor Magtoor.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Breath of Mist]] before heading out. The [[Misty Valley]] is in the northwest corner of the zone. Kill enough to collect 5 crystals, then head south past [[Splinterspear Junction]] to Purespring Cavern to kill water elementals. After that, circle back to the [[Harborage]].

==Progression==
{{Death of a Friend}}
