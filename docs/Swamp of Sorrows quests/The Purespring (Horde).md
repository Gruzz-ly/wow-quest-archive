== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Purespring Motes from [[Purespring Elemental]]s.
*[[Purespring Mote]] x6

== Description ==
[[Helgrum the Swift|Helgrum]]'s breathing slows. His time is near.

I need water. [[Elemental]]s roam the ponds of [[Purespring Cavern]]. The water that flows from them is the purest in this [[Swamp of Sorrows|swamp]].

Even if I could risk leaving Helgrum's side, my axe would shudder in my hand. I must beg you once again to pity me, for his comfort. Bring me the motes of the elementals, that his final drink may be pure and refreshing.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

== Progress ==
You've returned.

== Completion ==
He can only drink so much. The rest might be used for washing his body, after...

<Neeka glares in frustration and shudders, turning her head away.>

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Breath of Mist]] before heading out. The water elementals of Purespring Cavern are just to the south. [[Duskfang]] is in the very back of [[Misty Valley]] to the north, in a cave.

==Progression==
