==Objectives==
Collect 6 Ditty Bags from [[Deceased Bogpaddle Privateer]]s.
*[[Steamwheedle Ditty Bag]] x6

==Description==
Any shipping crew I had that you don't see hanging around this camp are DEAD! Those were some fine [[goblin]]s, but what's worse is they're all still out there! It's a TRAGEDY!

I mean, it's a tragedy they still have all their stuff! It's horrifying to think of all the perfectly good materials and coins sitting out there in the water.

Hey! You can do me a favor! If you're killing [[gilblin]]s out there, go get the ditty bags off my old crewmen!

C'mon, they're not gonna need it anymore! Be real!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Crazy Cap|Looter's Shoulderguards|Tragic Legguards|Larry's Boots}}
You will also receive: {{cost||75}}

==Progress==
You get those ditty bags? I hope you left the goblins there!

==Completion==
WOW!

I don't know why I said that, I'm excitable! But man, there was a lot of stuff on these guys, check it out!

Here, you want this?

==Notes==
Pick up [[Kill Gil]] before heading out. Run to the northeast to reach the [[Misty Reed Strand]], then loot the corpses while gilblin killing.
