==Objectives==
[[Fallen Hero of the Horde]] in {{C|Swamp of Sorrows}} wants you to kill the 6 Troll minibosses in the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|Sunken Temple]] and bring him the Voodoo Feathers that they drop.
*[[Amber Voodoo Feather]] (2)
*[[Blue Voodoo Feather]] (2)
*[[Green Voodoo Feather]] (2)

==Description==
Your honor has brought some peace to me. It is only right that I offer you something in return.

My weapons and armor were splendid in life, and yet they are of no use to me now. They would be better served in your possession.

Travel to the sunken temple and destroy the troll guardians [[Gasher]], [[Mijan]], [[Zolo]], [[Hukku]], [[Zul'Lor]], and [[Loro]]. They carry magic feathers that can reform my physical body long enough to grant you a reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5900 [[XP]]
*[[Fury Visor]]
*[[Diamond Flask]]
*[[Razorsteel Shoulders]]

==Progress==
Are you back so soon? Time is not the same to me any more, perhaps it has indeed been a long journey for you...

==Completion==
At last I can feel the cold touch of steel again, even if only for a moment.

==Notes==
The feathers drop from the [[Atal'ai Defenders]] in the [[Temple of Atal'Hakkar (Season of Discovery)|Temple of Atal'Hakkar]]

==Progression==
#[[A Troubled Spirit]]
#[[Warrior Kinship]]
