== Objectives ==
Collect 10 sprigs of Prayerblossom from the [[Shifting Mire]].
*[[Prayerblossom]]

== Description ==
I have worked for years to try to cure the affliction of the [[Broken]]. The foul energies that corrupted them did more than twist their bodies; it took the comfort of the [[Light]] from them. They cannot feel its warmth.

I cannot let {{NPC||Magtoor}} pass on in darkness, <name>. Before he worsened, he was studying prayerblossom, a flower that grows in the shifting mire. It grows hardy in even the darkest shade. I beg of you, gather these flowers for me, for Magtoor's sake.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||85}}

== Progress ==
Have you brought the prayerblossom?

== Completion ==
Prayerblossom has been used by the Broken as a remedy since they settled in [[Swamp of Sorrows|this swamp]]. If it soothes the physical form, it might be used for more powerful healing...

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Secrets of the Mire]] before heading out.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Anchorite Avuun says: The Exodar has not answered my pleas, <name>. I am afraid you are the only one who can help poor Magtoor.}}
