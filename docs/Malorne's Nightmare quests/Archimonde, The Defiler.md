==Objectives==
Defeat Archimonde.
* [[Archimonde]] slain

==Description==
We have turned the battle, <name>! The [[Burning Legion]] is greatly weakened.

Only one task remains. [[Malorne]] is locked in battle with Archimonde, the [[demon]] that slew him ten thousand years ago.

Remember, <name>, we are trapped in Malorne's nightmare. There is no telling what will manifest here, but we MUST do something.

May [[Elune]] guide us, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Malorne gazes directly at you. Radiant, soothing energy exudes outward from his body. Suddenly, you feel a serene sense of peace and gratitude envelop your entire being.>

==Notes==
Archimonde is located at the far west side of [[Malorne's Nightmare]], battling Malorne.
