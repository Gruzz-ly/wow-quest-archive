Choose an ally.
* Druid ally chosen

==Description==
Never has our [[Cenarion Circle|order]] faced such a difficult challenge. To succeed, we must rely on each other's strengths.

However, we only have a few defenders to spare for the battle ahead.

[[Broll Bearmantle|Broll]], [[Sylendra Gladesong|Sylendra]], [[Zen'tabra]], and [[Mylune]] have all volunteered to accompany you into the valley below, but I can only spare one.

Which one will you choose to aid you in battle?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you chosen?

==Completion==
Well chosen. The others will aid me in defending here. We must hurry.

==Notes==
You have four druid Champions to choose from, each representing a specialization.
