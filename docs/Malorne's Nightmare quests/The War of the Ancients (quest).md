==Objectives==
Win the [[War of the Ancients]].
* [[Yvelyn]] spoken to
* War of the Ancients won (0/100%)

==Description==
To free [[Malorne]], we must win the War of the Ancients. A millennia ago, this battle took the combined efforts of the greatest defenders of [[Azeroth|our world]]. To win now, we must do the same.

Go upon the battlefield and defeat [[Burning Legion|Legion]] foes, rescue and revive our allies, and free the innocent who have been caught in the battle. Every enemy defeated and every ally saved will help turn the tide in our favor!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You lead us to triumph today, <name>.

==Notes==
Yvelyn can be found northeast from Keeper Remulos, just a short distance away. She will give you a special [[AoE]] ability called "Yvelyn's Wrath" to assist you.

Once done speaking with her, you can now fill up a progress tracker bar by slaying demons, healing [[Injured Guardian of the Dream]], [[Revive|reviving]] [[Fallen Guardian of the Dream]], or destroying [[Nightmare Tendril (Malorne's Nightmare)|Nightmare Tendrils]].
