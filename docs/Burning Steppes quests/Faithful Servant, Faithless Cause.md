{{questportrait|Mar'kag.jpg|Mar'kag|Mar'kag has long served the [[Dark Horde]], and now leads their [[ogre]]s. It is time he was rewarded for his contributions.}}
Defeat Mar'kag.
*[[Mar'kag]] slain
*[[Mar'kag's Buckle|Relic Fragment recovered]]

==Description==
One of their lieutenants, Mar'kag. appears to be the one barking orders. His father, [[Highlord Omokk|High Overlord Omokk]], followed under [[Dal'rend Blackhand|Rend Blackhand]]'s banner. Cruel, vicious... no surprise that his son follows in his footsteps.

Taking Mar'kag down will spread chaos among the cowardly remnants of this [[Dark Horde]] and perhaps help them realize they are not as strong as they think.

[[Alonsus Faol|Faol]] also has us here to look for relic fragments. If Mar'kag has anything of note, bring it back.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Mar'kag's Handless Gloves]]
* [[Mar'kag's Anklet]]
* [[Mar'kag's Bracers]]
* [[Mar'kag's Oversized Ring]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you put a stop to Mar'kag, <name>?

==Completion==
As we defeat their leaders, the Dark Horde presence throughout the Burning Steppes will begin to splinter.

Mar'kag was the first to fall. Stopping him was a good first step.

It is unfortunate he did not leave when I did. He was not dishonorable--just blindly devoted to that tired cause.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting [[The Dark Horde]], [[None Left Standing]], & '''Faithful Servant, Faithless Cause'''
:{{Text|Say|[[Danath Trollbane]]|Come [[Kurdran Wildhammer|Kurdran]], we should scout out the other Dark Horde encampments.}}
:{{Text|Say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Pfft--The Dark Horde. They're stuck trying to win the [[Second War]] while we've made peace on the [[Fourth War|Fourth]]. Get with the times!}}
:''Danath Trollbane and Kurdran Wildhammer mounted on [[Sky'reen]] take off.''

[[Arator the Redeemer]] shall accompany you. 

;Aggro
:{{Text|Say|Mar'kag|You not want to fight Mar'kag!}}

;Upon slaying Mar'kag
:{{Text|Say|Mar'kag|How... Mar'kag so strong!}}

;Upon looting [[Mar'kag's Buckle]]
:{{Text|Say|Arator|This is one of the fragments that we're looking for. Might have been from a piece of armor or a shield.}}

Go to [[Eitrigg]] and turn in three quests.
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|The Horde left behind this dark past long ago. If only everyone here had come with us.}}

==Progression==
{{Regrets of the Past}}

==Trivia==
;Alpha description
<Name>, there's a particular ogre wandering around, Mar'kag--one of their [[lieutenant]]s.

He was there when I left, years ago. He's one of the strongest ogres I've ever met. so I can understand why he's giving orders now.

But he hasn't had the sense to move on. If we can take him down, it will spread chaos, and others might notice [[Dark Horde|their "Horde"]] isn't as strong as they believed.

I know [[Alonsus Faol|Faol]] also has us here to look for fragments of a particular relic, so if Mar'kag has anything of note, bring it back.
