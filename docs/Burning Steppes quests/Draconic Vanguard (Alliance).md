== Objectives ==
Slay Minyoth, Whelptamer Akumi, Terromath the Seared, and Tugnar Goremaw.
*[[Minyoth]] slain
*[[Whelptamer Akumi]] slain
*[[Terromath the Seared]] slain
*[[Tugnar Goremaw]] slain

== Description ==
The [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orcs]] don't come alone. You've already seen that they've got the [[Firegut]] ogres and [[Smolderthorn]] trolls on their side. Unfortunately for us, they're also teamed up with the [[black dragonflight]].

The orcs and dragons have already sent some of their champions to stand guard at rally points, which are marked by a dragon skull on a pike. You and I are going to find these rally points and take out this vanguard before the battle starts. 

Ready?

== Progress ==
Come on, <name>, there's still more of them left. Our job isn't done.

== Completion ==
Your kill count is adding up, <name>. We're chipping away at them.

And we are going to win. [[Redridge]] will NOT fall to these cowards.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Blood Tour]] and [[A Deal With a Dragon]] before heading out. Accepting the first of these three quests will put Keeshan in the player's party. Accept the rest of them before leaving Troteman. First, exit camp and turn west to reach the southwestern rally point by the pass to Redridge. Kill Akumi, then circle around Dreadmaul Rock counterclockwise to the northeast. All four of the targets are level 51. If you use other creatures to fight for you (like [[Hunter]] pets or [[Warlock]] minions), be sure to let the enemies damage your character as well. Keeshan will not fight until the player character has been attacked directly.
