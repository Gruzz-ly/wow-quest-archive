'''Not Fireflies, Flameflies''' is a gathering quest in the [[Burning Steppes]].

== Objectives ==
Gather 7 [[Flamefly|Flameflies]].
* [[Flamefly (item)]] x7

== Description ==
Most of my fellow residents here at Flame Crest seem to have left at some point. I guess the Burning Steppes weren't INTERESTING enough for them.

Not me, though. I'm always finding new reasons to not leave, and the latest happens to be the flameflies that have been appearing lately.

They appear near lava during the day. By night, you'll find them almost anywhere.

If you wouldn't mind collecting some, I might be able to make it worth your while.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Lava Boots
|Flamefly Spaulders
|Petting Gloves
}}

You will also receive: {{cost||75}} and 
{{itembox|
|Tiny Flamefly
}}

== Progress ==
Well?

== Completion ==
Nice work!  More pets for Kibler!

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Blackened Ashes]], [[Latent Demons of the Land]] and [[A Heap of Delicious Worg]] before heading out. Circle around to the southwest. Plenty of [[flamekin]] and flameflies in the magma nearby.
