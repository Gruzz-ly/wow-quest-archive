== Objectives ==
Obtain 11 Ember Worg Hides.
*[[Ember Worg Hide]] x11

== Description ==
We'll need [[worg]] hides, and lots of them. It doesn't matter if they're torn, burned, or bloody, but we need plenty of them.

Actually, it's probably better if they're a little beat-up.

You'll find worgs to the west.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||75}} and [[Ember Worg Eye]]

== Progress ==
Let's take a look at those hides.

== Completion ==
Believe me, <name>... I'm just as anxious to get to the killing as you are. We've got to keep to the plan. The armageddon will come soon enough.

I'll keep these hides here.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Stocking Up (Burning Steppes)|Stocking Up]] and [[Mud Hunter]] before heading out. Circle around to the northwest to find plenty of scorpids and worgs.

==Progression==
{{Burning Steppes storyline}}
