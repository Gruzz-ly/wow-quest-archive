==Objectives==
Report to [[Mouton Flamestar]] at [[Flamestar Post]] in [[Burning Steppes]].

==Description==
I get precious little time away from [[Searing Gorge]] these days. I've been meaning to visit a friend in Burning Steppes for the last several months, but haven't had the chance.

His name is Mouton Flamestar. While h's not a member of the [[Thorium Brotherhood|Brotherhood]], he's a trusted friend, and definitely trustworthy.

Will you send him my regards? You'll have to travel south, through the base of [[Blackrock Mountain]]. Just keep heading south... you'll find him.

Thank you.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

==Completion==
Oh, [[Overseer Oilfist|Oilfist]] sent you? Hah!

Did he ever tell you how he got the name Oilfist? You'll have to ask him about that one sometime.

==Notes==
Head south, go through Blackrock Mountain, exit through the Burning Steppes side, head down the ramp and turn right to reach Flamestar Post. Pick up the flight path!
