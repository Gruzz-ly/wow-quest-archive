==Objectives==
Kill 16 soldiers of the Dark Horde.
*Blackrock Soldier slain (16)

==Description==
I once served under [[Blackhand]], long ago. His son [[Dal'rend Blackhand|Rend Blackhand]] was a sniveling fool, a coward who bolstered himself in that Spire after Doomhammer was defeated. He made deals with dragons, called himself Warchief, and proclaimed his Dark Horde the 'true' Horde. Pah!

These Dark Horde embrace the ideals of a past long gone. Rend died [[Rend Blackhand (tactics)|years ago]]. but there are still orcs and ogres here who cling to the rotting husk that remains.

If they haven't seen the truth by now. there is little hope for them but death.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Perhaps, in the face of the death of their comrades, others will see sense as I did. At least those you killed won't dishonor themselves any longer.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting '''The Dark Horde''', [[None Left Standing]], & [[Faithful Servant, Faithless Cause]]
:{{Text|Say|[[Danath Trollbane]]|Come [[Kurdran Wildhammer|Kurdran]], we should scout out the other Dark Horde encampments.}}
:{{Text|Say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Pfft--The Dark Horde. They're stuck trying to win the [[Second War]] while we've made peace on the [[Fourth War|Fourth]]. Get with the times!}}
:''Danath Trollbane & Kurdran Wildhammer who mounted on [[Sky'reen]] took off.''

[[Arator the Redeemer]] shall accompany you. 

Slay as many [[Blackrock Soldier]]s, [[Smolderthorn Shaman]], [[Firegut Flamespeaker]]s, [[Firegut Apprentice]]s, [[Blackrock Sorcerer]]s, [[Smolderthorn Assassin]]s, [[Blackrock Sergeant]]s, [[Blackrock Slayer]]s, [[Firegut Reaver]]s, & [[Smolderthorn Cadet]]s alike.

;Upon slaying 4 soldiers
:{{Text|Say|Arator|My father, [[Turalyon]], fought in [[Siege of Blackrock Spire|this battle]], though he has rarely talked to me about it.}}

;Upon slaying 12 soldiers
:{{Text|Say|Arator|After [[Anduin Lothar]] fell in battle, my father rallied the Alliance to victory.}}

After 16 soldiers are slain, go to [[Eitrigg]] and turn in three quests.
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|The Horde left behind this dark past long ago. If only everyone here had come with us.}}

{{Regrets of the Past}}

==Trivia==
;Alpha description
I once served this [[Dark Horde]] under [[Dal'rend Blackhand|Rend Blackhand]] for years. One of my sons died fighting for them, against the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron]]. But Rend was a fool, unworthy of being called Warchief.

I left after that. And Rend died [[Rend Blackhand (tactics)|years ago]]. but there are still orcs and ogres here who cling to the rotting husk that remains.

If they haven't seen the truth by now, there is no hope for them but death.
