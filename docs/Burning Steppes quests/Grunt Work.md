==Objectives==
Vigorously polish 7 pairs of Blackrock Boots.
*Pairs of [[Blackrock Boots (object)|Blackrock Boots]] polished (7)

==Description==
Bah! You're lucky I'm short-handed today. Otherwise I'd make you my personal whipping <boy/girl> for the week.

The officers and high-ranking soldiers need their boots polished. They've left them out in front of their huts.

I want to see my reflection in those boots, grunt! Get to work!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

==Progress==
Oh, you're asking for it now, grunt.

==Completion==
Hmph. Good work, grunt.

==Notes==
On accept, [[Colonel Troteman]] (if [[Alliance]]) or [[Eitrigg]] (if [[Horde]]) calls in with [[Strategic Cuts]]. Accept it before heading out. Head up the Pillar of Ash first. Keep an eye out for boots... which may have [[Boot Spider]]s inside of them! [[Voodooist Timan]] is atop the pillar. Othana is in the middle of camp in the worg pens. Gorlop is running between lava pools on the south side. After killing all three, make sure to shine seven pairs of boots and turn back in to Kaoshin.
