:{{Text|Say|[[Alonsus Faol]]|Kurdran flew to the entrance of Blackrock Spire, <name>. He's tracked down the next fragment.}}

[[Arator the Redeemer]] shall accompany you. 

Head to the Blackrock Mountains and meet up with Kurdran.

Kurdran has a new gossip:
{{Dialogue|The orcs an' ogres here have been a thorn in our side for far too long, <name>.


{{Gossip|How have you kept at it for so long, Kurdran?}}
{{Dialogue-child|I've seen some dark times, <name>. A whole lotta 'em.

Flyin' does me a lot of good, fer sure, but not ever'body has a gryphon!

If you don't, then you gotta find out what your gryphon is.

Fer me... jokes help. If you cannae laugh in the hard times... well, we're gonna run into 'em. May as well laugh.

And a pint with friends makes any problem seem smaller. The friends even more than the pints!

And sometimes you just gotta move forward, ready or not. Shall we?}}
