== Objectives ==
Kill any 15 [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] troops on your way to [[Chiselgrip]].
*Blackrock troop slain x15

== Description ==
We're headed to Chiselgrip, right in the center of [[Burning Steppes|these steppes]]. We'll rendezvous with the [[Thorium Brotherhood]] there, as well as with {{NPC||Colonel Troteman||Trotemen}}.

You familiar with the Brotherhood? Those [[dark iron dwarves]] have helped me out more than once.  We may need their help once again.

We'll pass through [[Black Tooth Hovel]] on our way there.  What do you say we kill a few orcs while we travel?  I'm getting a little restless here in [[Flamestar Post|this camp]].

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Oreknuckle Gun|Unburdened Pauldrons|Black Tooth Helm|Vest of Welcome}}
You also will receive: {{cost||75}}

== Progress ==
You'll have to excuse me, but we're not taking visitors right now.  I'll ask you to leave Chiselgrip out the same door you came in.

== Completion ==
You'll have to excuse me, but we're not taking visitors right now.  I'll ask you to leave Chiselgrip out the same door you came in.

Oh, {{NPC||John J. Keeshan||Keeshan}}... is that you?

== Notes ==
On accept, Keeshan will join the player on the trek across the steppes. Mount up and head to Black Tooth Hovel, then start killing. Keeshan is more than capable of going it alone, but help him out to speed up the process and to actually get credit for the kills. Keep in mind that Keeshan will only attack a [[mob]] if the mob hits you (not your [[hunter]] pet or [[warlock]] minion), otherwise he will say aggro quotes continuously but not fight. After killing 15, head to the center of the zone to reach Chiselgrip, where Oreknuckle awaits. Don't forget the flight path! After turning in, Keeshan can be found south of Oreknuckle's position, speaking with Troteman. For Horde players, Ariok can be found to the west, speaking with {{NPC||Eitrigg}}!

Keeshan has aggro quotes:
* {{text|say|John J. Keeshan|Killin's as easy as breathin'.}}
* {{text|say|John J. Keeshan|You maggots brought this on yourselves.}}
* {{text|say|John J. Keeshan|Damn these orcs.}}
* {{text|say|John J. Keeshan|More blood!  I want more blood!}}
* {{text|say|John J. Keeshan|See you in hell.}}
