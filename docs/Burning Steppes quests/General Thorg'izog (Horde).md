== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||General Thorg'izog}}.

== Description ==
{{NPC||Quartermaster Kaoshin||Kaoshin}} turned out to be more helpful than I expected, but we're done with him. It's time you spoke with the General. I think you're ready.

General Thorg'izog is one of the "big three" that run the ground forces here in [[Burning Steppes]] He does so from the [[Blackrock Stronghold]] to the northwest. Put on your disguise and go speak with him. See if you can earn his trust. {{NPC||Eitrigg||I}} will be in touch, should I need anything further.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

== Completion ==
More outsiders? What do you want?

== Notes ==
To the northwest, past the [[Fields of Honor]] into the stronghold. Watch out for {{NPC||Magma Lord Kolob}} inside, being kept hot by {{NPC||Goblin Flamethrower}}s. He is hostile, but cannot be attacked, yet.

; Lost Disguise
* Look in your bag. The [[Blackrock Disguise]] looks like a red cloth and you can re-apply it if the buff wore off.
* Drop the quest and talk to the tailoring table to remake the disguise.
