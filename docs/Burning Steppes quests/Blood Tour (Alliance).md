== Objectives ==
Kill 25 {{NPC||Black Dragonspawn}} or {{NPC||Black Wyrmkin}}.
*Black Dragonspawn slain x25

== Description ==
My legs are getting a little restless again. You interested in taking a little tour, <name>?

We're going to take a trip around [[Dreadmaul Rock]]. I'd like to investigate some of the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock army]] before we make our move, and I figure we might as well kill some of them while we're on the way.

== Progress ==
No, I'm not satisfied yet. I need more blood. 

== Completion ==
<Keeshan is covered in blood and sweat.>

That was exactly what I needed.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Draconic Vanguard]] and [[A Deal With a Dragon]] as well before heading out. Accepting the first of these three quests will put Keeshan in the player's party. Accept the rest of them before leaving Troteman. First, exit camp and turn west to reach the southwestern rally point by the pass to Redridge. If you use other creatures to fight for you (like [[Hunter]] pets or [[Warlock]] minions), be sure to let the enemies damage your character as well. Keeshan will not fight until the player character has been attacked  directly. Kill Akumi, then circle around Dreadmaul Rock counterclockwise to the northeast. Don't focus on killing dragonkin—that will happen naturally while completing the other quests. Don't make detours avoiding them, however. The last of the named targets for Draconic Vanguard is on the north side of Dreadmaul, so plan to have 25 dead after making the trip up to the north and back down to Morgan's Vigil. 

Complete all three quests and Troteman will radio in with [[Placing the Pawns]].
