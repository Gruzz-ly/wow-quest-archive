== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Gorzeeki Wildeyes}} near the [[Altar of Storms (Burning Steppes)|Altar of Storms]].

== Description ==
{{NPC||Colonel Troteman}} is waiting for us to the east. Before we head out though, we need to gather some more stuff. This time, you'll be taking it from a [[warlock]] by the name of Gorzeeki Wildeyes.

You'll probably find him to the northwest, near the Altar of Storms. Tell him he's going to help us out. We need the sand, the cider, and the orb.

He'll know what it means.

== Completion ==
Hah! Who are you?

Oh, so {{NPC||John J. Keeshan||Keeshan}} sent you? Good. Would ya mind sticking around for a while? It's nothing big... I just need you to kill some warlocks for me.

== Notes ==
Up the path to the northwest... a goblin warlock!
