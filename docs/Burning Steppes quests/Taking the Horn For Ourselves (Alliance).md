==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Colonel Troteman.jpg|Colonel Troteman|A horn like that will work on more than just kodos...}}
Bring the Horn of the Callers back to [[Colonel Troteman]] at [[Chiselgrip]] in [[Burning Steppes]].
*[[Horn of the Callers (2)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, it's Troteman.  I want you to hold onto that horn.  I'm sure we can improvise and find a way to work it into the plan.

I'm more than a little concerned about what {{NPC||Quartermaster Kaoshin||Kaoshin}} said about attacking [[Redridge Mountains|Redrige]].  We knew another attack was imminent, but our timetables were off by several days.

Return to me, with the horn.  We will talk again here, in Chiselgrip.  And try not to ruin that disguise.  You're not done with your undercover work yet.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Helm of Serendipity|Improvised Breastplate|Leggings of the Steppes}}
You will also receive: {{cost||75}}

==Progress==
Welcome back, soldier.

==Completion==
I didn't count on obtaining an item like this.  I will change our plans accordingly.

==Notes==
Back to Chiselgrip, to the north. Keeshan offers the followup.

==Progression==
