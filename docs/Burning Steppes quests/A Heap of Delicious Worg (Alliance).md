==Objectives==
Use the Worgsaw on the bodies of slain [[Giant Ember Worg]]s to obtain 40 Worg Cutlets.
*[[Worg Cutlet]] x40
*[[Worgsaw]] (provided)

==Description==
We're going to need fresh meat, which means you're going to be hunting [[worg]]. The worg on this side of [[Burning Steppes|the steppes]] should be your target.

<[[Colonel Troteman|Troteman]] produces a large blade, which he hands to you.>

Hunt the giant ember worgs. Once you've killed them, use this saw to remove the choicest bits of meat from their bodies. You will find these worgs all over the steppes, but the closest pack rules the land just to our northwest.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

==Progress==
Any luck out there?

==Completion==
This meat looks good... but I think it needs a little "seasoning". I'll make sure that gets taken care of.

Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
*Pick up all of [[SEVEN! YUP!]], [[Blackened Ashes]] and [[Latent Demons of the Land]] before heading out. Kill and loot giant ember worgs, then use the worgsaw to collect three to five cutlets per worg.
*[[Deathmaw]] does not count.
