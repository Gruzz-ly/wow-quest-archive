== Objectives ==
Kill 25 {{NPC||Black Dragonspawn}} or {{NPC||Black Wyrmkin}}.
*Black Dragonspawn slain x25

== Description ==
My legs are getting a little restless again. You interested in taking a little tour, <name>?

We're going to take a trip around [[Dreadmaul Rock]]. I'd like to investigate some of the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock army]] before we make our move, and I figure we might as well kill some of them while we're on the way.

== Progress ==
No, I'm not satisfied yet. I need more blood. 

== Completion ==
<Ariok is covered in blood and sweat.>

That was exactly what I needed.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Draconic Vanguard]] and [[A Deal With a Dragon]] before heading out. Accepting the first of these three quests will put Ariok in the player's party. Accept the rest of them before leaving Eitrigg. Keep in mind that Ariok will only attack a [[mob]] if the mob hits you (not your [[hunter]] pet or [[warlock]] minion). First, exit camp and head southeast, then northeast, following the mountains. Kill Terromath, then circle around Dreadmaul Rock clockwise. All four of the targets are level 51. Don't focus on killing dragonkin—that will happen naturally while completing the other quests. Don't make detours avoiding them, however. The last of the named targets for Draconic Vanguard is southwest of Dreadmaul, so plan to have 25 dead before making the trip up the north and back to Flame Crest.

Complete all three quests and Eitrigg will radio in with [[Placing the Pawns]].
