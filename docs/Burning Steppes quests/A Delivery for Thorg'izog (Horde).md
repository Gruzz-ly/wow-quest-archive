== Objectives ==
Using your [[Blackrock Disguise]], bring the Slider Cider-Marinated Cutlets to {{NPC||General Thorg'izog}} at [[Firegut Furnace]] in [[Burning Steppes]]. Speak with {{NPC||Eitrigg}} if you need a new Blackrock Disguise.
*[[Slider Cider-Marinated Cutlets]] (provided)

== Description ==
General Thorg'izog is staying among the [[ogre]]s in the Firegut Furnace, a cave on the western edge of [[Dreadmaul Rock]]. I'd like you to deliver this to him and the ogres.

Inside this package, you will find the worg cutlets that you obtained, marinated in the fel slider cider that we took from the [[Altar of Storms (Burning Steppes)|Altar of Storms]].

I would avoid eating it if I were you.

Bring it to General Thorg'izog. He will make sure that his troops are fed and, with any luck, he will eat some himself.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

== Progress ==
What've you got there, soldier?

== Completion ==
Would you look at that! My favorite soldier comes through in the clutch!

I'll make sure to get this distributed among the ogres.

I'll see you in [[Redridge]], soldier. For the glory of the Blackrock!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Delivery for Neeralak]] and [[A Delivery for Xi'lun]] before heading out. Put on the costume and mount up. The entrance to Firegut Furnace is at {{co|65.2|46.6|Burning Steppes}} on the ground level of the west side of Dreadmaul Rock. Head in and keep taking forks to the left to find the general.

On complete:
:{{text|yell|General Thorg'izog|Come on boys, let's eat! My favorite soldier brought enough worg for everyone!}}
After completing all three, Eitrigg radios in with [[Locked and Loaded]].
