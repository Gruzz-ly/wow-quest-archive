== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Wyrtle Spreelthonket}} and ask him to release Magma Lord Kolob. Then defeat Magma Lord Kolob in battle.

== Description ==
I suppose I'll make the most of this situation. These [[goblin]] mercenaries brought this enormous [[fire elemental]] to [[Blackrock Stronghold|my stronghold]] as a "thank you" for hiring them. What am I going to do with an elemental here in the [[Burning Steppes|steppes]]? That's like bringing sand to the beach.

If you're looking for work, then prove yourself. Talk to this goblin here, and challenge his elemental to a fight. The victor earns my respect, and my time.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Thorg'izog's Band|Bracers of Gladiatorial Combat|Poorly Styled Gloves|Magma Lord Cloak}}
You will receive: {{cost|1|50}}

== Progress ==
What's the matter, are you scared?

== Completion ==
I had a feeling you'd be the one returning to me. I like your style, soldier.

== Notes ==
Head a few steps to the east and talk to Wrytle:
:It ain't easy gettin' a contract with the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orcs]]. I mean, come one! The Blackrock orcs! These guys have been through more battles than {{NPC||Aggramar}}, AND they're sittin' on a mountain made of [[dark iron]] to boot! Cha-ching!
{{gossip|''I'd like to challenge your magma lord to a fight.''}}
:{{text|yell|Wyrtle Spreelthonket|Alright boys, we got a challenger! Time to show the general what our little captive can do!}}
Kolob is a level 51 bound fire elemental with 4011 health. Outside of basic melee, it has one ability:
*{{abilities|Gout of Flame|range=30|Creates a geyser of flame at the target location.|notes=1.5 sec cast. Launches a fireball at the targeted location on the ground. If players are within a few yards of it when it hits, they take ~160 Fire}}
Otherwise, a straightforward fight.

On victory:
:{{text|say|Wyrtle Sprellthonket|Nooo! My baby...}}
:{{text|say|General Thorg'izog|Ah ha ha! Well done!}}

==Progression==
