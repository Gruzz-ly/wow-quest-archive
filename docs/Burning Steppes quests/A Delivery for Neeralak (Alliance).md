== Objectives ==
Using your [[Blackrock Disguise]], sneak into the [[Skull Warren]] and convince {{NPC||Dragon-Lord Neeralak}} to take your Crate of Sleeping Flamekin. Speak with {{NPC||Colonel Troteman}} if you need a new Blackrock Disguise.
*[[Crate of Sleeping Flamekin]] (provided)

== Description ==
The [[warlock]]s of the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock Clan]] often practice their magic in the Skull Warren, a cave on the eastern side of [[Dreadmaul Rock]]. Their leader, {{NPC||High Warlock Xi'lun||Xi'lun}}, is busy elsewhere, so the cave is currently being held by another of the big three: Dragon-Lord Neeralak. And Neeralak's expertise is in [[dragon]]s, not [[necromancy]].

I've used the slumber sand on those [[flamekin]] you captured. Try to convince Neeralak that they're warlock [[imp]]s, and not flamekin. When they wake up, they won't be happy.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

== Progress ==
What?

== Completion ==
What are these? Oh, are these imps?

I'm pretty sure that imps don't just fall asleep in boxes!

I'll take your word for it, though. I don't understand any of this warlock crap. Leave them in the corner.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Delivery for Thorg'izog]] and [[A Delivery for Xi'lun]] before heading out. Put on the costume and mount up. The entrance to the [[Skull Warren]] is at {{co|70.7|38.0|Burning Steppes}} on the middle level of the northeast side of Dreadmaul Rock. Enter and keep taking lefts to reach the bottom of the cave system.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Dragon-Lord Neeralak|I guess I'll just... leave the sleeping imps right over here? Are these even... imps? Gah!}}
After completing all three, Troteman radios in with [[Locked and Loaded]].
