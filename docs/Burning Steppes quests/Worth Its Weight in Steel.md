==Description==
Listen, ye seem like one who may be interested in getting a copy of those axe plans.

Could probably make a pretty penny at the [[auction house]] on it. But I can't just hand 'em over to ya, <lad/lass>. Not fer free.

That axe blade ye brought me, I could use more of those. Good steel in those blades. Don't worry, <lad/lass>, I just need a few... hundred.

What do ye say?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Plans: Bleakwood Hew]]
*820 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You see, I've got a shipment ta fill and it's been slim pickin' round these parts for good metal. Those blades are just what I'm lookin' for.

==Completion==
Oh ho! Look at all that STEEL!

I'll have this shipment finished by the end o' the week. Well done, <lad/lass! Well done!

An' as I promised, here are those plans for the hew.
