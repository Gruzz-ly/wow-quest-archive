==Objectives==
Report to [[Kibler]] at [[Flame Crest]] in Burning Steppes.

==Description==
Our work here in Chiselgrip is done, mostly thanks to you.  We'll now be moving on to the northeast, to Flame Crest.

Flame Crest is in the cliffs, past the Ruins of Thaurissan.  It should serve as a sufficient base of operations for the final stages of our plan.

Of course, my son [[Ariok]] will be joining you on the road.  As will [[Eitrigg|I]].

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

==Completion==
Oh.  Visitors? 

== Notes ==
On accept, Ariok and Eitrigg join the player's party. Mount up and head northeast through the [[Ruins of Thaurissan]] to the northern mountain range of [[Burning Steppes]]. Kibler is inside the cave at the back of Flame Crest.

On complete, Ariok and Eitrigg set up outside the cave.
