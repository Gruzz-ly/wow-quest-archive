== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Quartermaster Kaoshin}} at the [[Black Tooth Hovel]] in [[Burning Steppes]].

== Description ==
Undercover work is all about swagger. Just act like you're supposed to be there, and you'll be fine.

Your contact inside Black Tooth Hovel will be an orc by the name of Quartermaster Kaoshin. He does NOT know you're a spy, so try and stay cool. Do whatever he asks of you.

<Eitrigg presses a small mechanical object into your palm.>

Place this device in your ear. I will be in touch to give you any special instructions.

Good luck out there, soldier.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

== Completion ==
Where have you been, grunt? You're late! Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you on the spot!

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|Don't forget to put on that disguise!}}
Exit and turn due south. Kaoshin is standing outside the [[Pillar of Ash]] just across the road. So long as you are wearing the [[Blackrock Disguise]], he will be friendly.

Once you put on your disguise, you discover the reason for Eitrigg's concern: it's nothing more than altering your sleeves, removing any tabards and a [[Hallow's End]] [[A Mask for All Occasions|mask]]!
