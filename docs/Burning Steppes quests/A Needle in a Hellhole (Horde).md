== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Thelaron Direneedle}} at [[Chiselgrip]] in [[Burning Steppes]].

== Description ==
Lok'tar, <class>. My name is Eitrigg, of the [[Argent Crusade]]... formerly of the [[Warchief]]'s Honor Guard. Before that, of the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orcs]].

I trust my [[Ariok|son]] has briefed you on our plan. He hasn't? That is probably for the better.

The next part of the plan is going to require a bit of subtlety. Speak with Thelaron Direneedle, the tailor here in town. I've already given him the hides and mud that you've collected. He's going to need to size you.

That's right, <race>: you're going undercover.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

== Completion ==
You need a disguise?  Well, you came to the right place, sister ''(if female)'' / honey ''(if male)''.

Let me take a look... mm-hmm.  I know exactly what we'll do.

== Notes ==
Just 40 yards to the east or so...
