== Objectives ==
Obtain 9 piles of Obsidian-Flecked Mud.
*[[Obsidian-Flecked Mud]] x9

== Description ==
Hope you're not afraid of getting dirty. Judging by the looks of you, that won't be a problem.

To the north, at the lava's edge, you'll find piles of dark mud. I need it.

It'd be best if you didn't ask questions, and focused your efforts on following orders, <name>. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||75}} and [[Obsidian-Flecked Cowl]]

== Progress ==
You'll want to watch out for those obsidian elementals.  They have a tendency to sneak up on you. 

== Completion ==
This is exactly what we need.

Don't worry, <name>... the killing will come soon enough. 

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Stocking Up (Burning Steppes)|Stocking Up]] and [[A Future Project]] before heading out. Head north. The piles are everywhere near the lava, including under the bridge.
