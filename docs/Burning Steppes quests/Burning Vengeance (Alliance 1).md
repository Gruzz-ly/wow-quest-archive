== Objectives ==
Slay 5 Blackrock Whelpers and 5 Flamescale Broodlings.
*[[Blackrock Whelper]] slain x5
*[[Flamescale Broodling]] slain x5

== Description ==
The [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orc]]s are ceaseless. They wait atop the battle-plains to the east, poised to strike at any moment.

They already attacked [[Redridge Mountains|my homeland]] once. I'm here to make sure it doesn't happen again.

If you hold any love for mankind, you'll do the same. So prove yourself. Travel south, to the [[Whelping Downs]], and slay their whelpers and the hatchling black dragons. Prove to me that you're ready for this war.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

== Progress ==
I suppose you don't have what it takes.

That's fine. I can fight this war myself.

== Completion ==
So you're in, then?

Good.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Done Nothing Wrong]] before heading out.
