== Objectives ==
Help 4 Chiseled Golems with their combat training.
*{{NPC||Chiseled Golem}}s trained

== Description ==
Yer provin' to be a pretty big help around here, <race>. I was thinkin ye could help with just one more thing.

Our guards are strong, but they're not as strong as you are. I was thinkin', maybe if ye wouldn't mind, ye might help some of 'em with their training? Just go up and talk to one and fight 'em a few times. Hopefully they'll learn from yer moves and get better.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Chiselgrip Shield|Combat Training Vest|Bracers of Friendly Favors|Tutor's Cloak}}
You will also receive: {{cost|1|45}}

== Progress ==
Please help us out, <race>.

== Completion ==
Yer a lifesaver, <name>. With golems like these, we won't have to worry about [[Dark Iron clan|dark irons]], [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orcs]]... maybe even [[black dragonflight|dragons]]!

If ye ever need anything from the [[Thorium Brotherhood]], don't hesistate to ask. That goes for yer friends too.

== Notes ==
Find a Chiseled Golem, a level 51 mechanical with 2292 health, and talk to it:
:Greetings, friend of the Brotherhood.
{{gossip|''I'm here to help you with your combat training, golem.''}}
The golem turns hostile! It starts out with basic melee only. Kill it!
*{{text|say|Chiseled Golem|Battle result: embarrasing failure. Incorporating new methods into battle regimen.}}
*{{text|say|Chiseled Golem|Beatdown received. Optimizing strategy for next battle...}}
*{{text|say|Chiseled Golem|Defeated. Shame level; High. Adjusting strategy for future battles.}}
It regenerates to full health, going immune temporarily in the process, and it learns a new ability:
*{{abilities|Heave|range=Melee|Deals damage and tosses the target over the caster's shoulder.}}
:{{text|Chiseled Golem|Self-training complete!}}
The golem drops its immunity shield. Kill it again! It will repeat the process and learn its third ability:
*{{abilities|Flame Blast|Sends a wave of flame in front of the golem, causing Fire damage within 10 yards in a frontal cone for until cancelled.}}
Kill it again. It has had enough after its third beatdown, however:
:{{text|say|Chiseled Golem|Training level sufficient. Returning to guard duty. Thank you.}}
This concludes Stebben's quests. Pick up with Keeshan.
