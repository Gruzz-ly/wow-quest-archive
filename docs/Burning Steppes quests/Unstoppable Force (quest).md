==Objectives==
Ask Kurdran about the events of that day.
*Ask [[Kurdran]] what happened.
*Check on [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]

==Description==
This statue seems out of place here. Nothing else like it. But this is where [[Anduin Lothar]] fell against [[Orgrim Doomhammer]] at the [[Siege of Blackrock Spire|Battle of Blackrock Mountain]].

Many fought on this field. Many didn't make it. Lothar....

Let me tell ye what happened all those years ago.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
It's a tragic story, but with the fragments of Turalyon's shield, maybe something better can be made of it.

Perhaps the shield can be restored--an' our friend as well.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|[[Alonsus Faol]]|As you have guessed, that is [[Turalyon|your father]]'s shield. Broken into fragments and left on the field of battle.}}

Speak with Kurdran.
{{dialogue|The Alliance... Turalyon... Everything changed in only a moment.

{{gossip|quest=|{{text|Blue|(Play movie)}} What happened?}}

A [[Midnight in-game cinematics|real-time cutscene]] "Shattered" starts playing:

:{{Text|Bossemote|FLASHBACK: Kurdran and [[Danath Trollbane|Danath]] narrate the infamous Battle of Blackrock Mountain that occurred 30 years ago between the [[Alliance]] and the [[Horde]].}}

:{{Text|Bossemote|Turalyon and Lothar fight back to back, but Orgrim Doomhammer destroys Turalyon's shield, knocking him down.}}

:{{Text|Bossemote|Orgrim kills Lothar, and Turalyon goes berserk--the first instance of Turalyon's Light turning to wrath and blind rage..}}

:{{Text|Bossemote|Kurdran and Danath say that losing Lothar is a wound Turalyon has ever healed from.}}

Back to the present, speak with Arator.
{{dialogue|title=Arator|Turalyon in these early days sounds like someone I've simply never met, <name>.

{{gossip|quest=|<Ask Arator how he is doing.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I had no idea. I didn't realize what my father went through.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I think... I think I'd like to fix this shield, and return it to him.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Alonsus Faol]]|That is an excellent idea.}}

==Progression==
{{Regrets of the Past}}

==Trivia==
*The second sentence in the description in the alpha was: "He was just as out of place among humans, elves, an' dwarves--being the Incredible warrior he was, as his statue is today."
