==Objectives==
Kill [[War Reaver]]s in the [[Ruins of Thaurissan]], then loot 3 Obsidian Pistons, 3 Flux Exhaust Sieves, 3 Thorium Gearshafts, and 1 Stone Power Core from the [[War Reaver Parts]] that they drop.
*[[Obsidian Piston]] (3)
*[[Flux Exhaust Sieve]] (3)
*[[Thorium Gearshaft]] (3)
*[[Stone Power Core]]

==Description==
We keep golems [[Chiselgrip|here]], as guards. The [[Dark Iron clan|dwarves]] to our north also keep golems, but I'm not sure why.

Mainly just for killin', I suppose.

We could use some spare parts for our own golems, so here's what yer gonna do: kill theirs, then look for any parts that might've fallen on the ground. Salvage what ye can. Ye probably won't be able to salvage everything, so choose carefully.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

==Progress==
We build these golems ourselves, ye know. A little mechanical work, a little elemental work... the results aren't half bad, if ye ask me.

==Completion==
This is exactly what we needed. I'll get the boys workin' on the next batch of golems right away.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Prove Yer Allegiance]] before heading out. Then kill war reavers. They drop War Reaver parts on the ground ''at the spot where the player was when the reaver died!'':
:You find a few salvagable parts in the ruined creature's hull. It looks like you will only be able to salvage one part.
Any two of:
*{{gossip|''Salvage the Obsidion Piston.''}}
*{{gossip|''Salvage the Flux Exhaust Sieve.''}}
*{{gossip|''Salvage the Thorium Gearshaft.''}}
*{{gossip|''Salvage the Stone Power Core. These are rare!''}}
Pick the power core as soon as it pops, otherwise, choose at random until the proper amount of pieces are gathered.
