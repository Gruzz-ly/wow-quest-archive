== Objectives ==
Obtain a handful of Slumber Sand, a jug of Fel Slider Cider, and a Clear Glass Orb.
*[[Slumber Sand]]
*[[Fel Slider Cider]]
*[[Clear Glass Orb]]

== Description ==
{{NPC||John J. Keeshan||Keeshan}} said he needs supplies? I've got plenty of supplies! Problem is, those [[warlock]]s have kicked me out of my home, and they're not letting me back in.

<Gorzeeki sizes you up.>

You might be able to get in, though. Head north, and grab some of my slumber sand, my fel slider cider, and a clear glass orb. I'm pretty sure that's what he wants.

Oh, and if you happen to accidentally kill any of those [[Blackrock clan|orc]]s while you're up there, I wouldn't be terribly upset.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

== Progress ==
Let's see if you managed to get everything.

== Completion ==
I hope that's what Keeshan was looking for. It's not doing me much good right now, anyhow.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Shadow Boxing]] before heading out. The warlocks drop the orbs. Look up the hill to the left. Wildeyes's place is on the west side of the valley.
