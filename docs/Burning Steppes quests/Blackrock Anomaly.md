== Objectives ==
Find [[Acride]]. 

== Description ==
There is an [[orc]] inside [[Blackrock Spire]] much unlike the others. He speaks with the intelligence and wisdom of one beyond his appeared years, and does not fight against our soldiers like the others do.

You must travel northwest to Blackrock Spire and find this orc, known only to us as Acride. Perhaps he is the key to stopping the orcish army. Perhaps we can stop [[Nefarian]] before it is too late... 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||9}}

== Completion ==
Hello, what is your business in a place like this?

So you come at the will of [[Mayara Brightwing|Miss Brightwing]], do you? Very interesting indeed.
