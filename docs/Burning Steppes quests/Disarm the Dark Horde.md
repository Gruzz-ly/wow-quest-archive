==Objectives==
Destroy 8 Dark Horde Weapon Racks.
* [[Dark Horde Weapon Rack|Weapon Rack]] destroyed (8)

==Description==
The [[Dark Horde]] are brutal and cruel. No love fer their equipment. Look at their weapons! Cracked, rusted, blunt, and bent. Ach! It's shameful! The only way they function is by making more shoddy tools to constantly replace the ones they've broken.

That gives me an idea though. If you see any of their weapon racks destroy 'em. Let's see how well they fight without their rusty blades.

Now a bare-fisted [[orc]] is nothing to sneeze at. But it'll further delay whatever daft plan to attack peaceful villagers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Did ye destroy their weapons racks?

Aye, that'll do. We've bought the surrounding town a few months of peace while they resupply.
