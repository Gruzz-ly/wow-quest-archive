==Objectives==
Retrieve Stone Guard badges from the Dark Horde in Blackrock Mountain.
*[[Stone Guard's Badge]] (8)

==Description==
[[Blackrock Mountain]] is the [[Dark Horde]]'s bloody mythology. All their unit commanders adorn themselves with badges and strut around like they won the [[Second War]]. Shameful! But it gives me an idea.

Defeat them and take their badges. They won't be able to promote new leaders until they make more. These blowhards like the pomp of command. Who wants the stress of leadership with no fancy badge to wear?

Head on in there with [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] and keep 'em busy. [[Sky'reen]] an' I will support ye from the air.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That gave 'em a kick in the pants!

I don't see any of their lot volunteering to lead their warbands after that humiliation.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting '''Due Recognition''', [[Nagosh the Scarred (quest)]], & [[Disarm the Dark Horde]]
:{{Text|Say|Kurdran Wildhammer|The orcs in the mountain don't just have a fragment, they're also stockpiling weapons.}}
:{{Text|Say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Seems like a good chance tae smash things up, if ye ask me. Let me know if ye want me tae join in the fun.}}
:''Kurdran Wildhammer flew into the Blackrock Mountains.''

[[Arator the Redeemer]] shall accompany you. 

Slay the Blackrock Orcs and loot the Stone Guard's Badges. Head to the Blackrock Mountains and meet up with Kurdran.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|Say|Arator|This whole expedition has something to do with [[Turalyon|my father]], doesn't it?}}
