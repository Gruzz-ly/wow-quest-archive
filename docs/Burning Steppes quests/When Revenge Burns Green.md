==Objectives==
Confront Madam Shadow in the Blasted Lands.
*Find [[Madam Shadow]] in the [[Blasted Lands]]

==Description==
Whatever game this Madam Shadow has been playing, it appears as though we're nearing the end of it.

<Oman grunts in pain.>

From what we've heard, it sounds like our next destination is somewhere in the Blasted Lands.  I must rest, but please <name>... go and see this through. Bring Madam Shadow to account. Avenge our fellow [[warlock]]s.

==Rewards==
You will gain these followers:
*{{Abilities|Fiendish Imps|id=417884|Unlock a new brand of [[imp]]s to serve. You can customize them in the [[barbershop]].|icon=inv_imp3_purple}}

You will receive:
*{{Cost|21}}
*5,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Those soulstones... the other warlocks.

<Oman closes his green eyes.>

When I chose to walk this path, I knew there would be repercussions. That I would be sacrificing a part of myself. A part of how my people see me.

But to have your soul torn asunder... for what? Petty revenge?

Truly that is a fate worse than anything I have taken upon myself.

==Notes==
Fly south to the Blasted Lands and head to the [[Tainted Scar]]. Where Madam Shadow and her three [[Imbued Soulstone]]s are present.

:{{Text|say|Madam Shadow|Ah, <name>. I wasn't expecting you for some time.}}
:{{Text|say|Madam Shadow|It matters not. I assume you're here to avenge the others of your kind? How quaint.}}
:{{Text|say|Madam Shadow|I've stolen the [[soul]]s of thousands of warlocks, and will continue to do so...}}
:{{Text|say|Madam Shadow|Until my revenge upon the spineless [[summoner]]s of this [[Azeroth|turgid world]] is complete!}}
:''Madam Shadow reveals to be [[Lord Banehollow]] and attacks.''

Banehollow summons various demons. Subjugate them to aid in the fight.

:{{Text|say|Lord Banehollow|You face Lord Banehollow!}}
:{{Text|say|Lord Banehollow|Impotent mortal! These souls give me access to powers beyond your reckoning!}}
:{{Text|say|Lord Banehollow|True power requires sacrifice... willing or otherwise!}}
:''[[Initiate Oman]] joins the fight.''
:{{Text|say|Lord Banehollow|Draenei! Your people cannot outrun the perditions of this cosmos... not even with the powers of [[fel]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|For the [[Xenedar]]! For the [[Genedar]]!}}

;Banehollow defeated
:{{Text|say|Lord Banehollow|I'll... be... back.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|I must recover my wits, <name>...}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|... and whatever parts of myself remain.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|Once I am more... whoever I am now, I will reach out to you.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|Dioniss aca, my friend.}}

On the next weekly reset, Oman sends a [[Letter from Oman|letter]] via mail.
