==Objectives==
Speak with [[Ragged John]] at [[Morgan's Vigil]] in the [[Burning Steppes]].
*Speak to Ragged John
*[[Chewed Piece of Journal]] (4)

==Description==
Whatever is going on, I don't like it. Last thing we need is this [[dragon]] lady's power corrupting everyone again.

Whoever did this must have known much about [[Onyxia]]. [[Mathias Shaw|Shaw]] mentioned this... [[Reginald Windsor]]. He was the only one to suspect Lady Prestor. Well, maybe his friends in the Burning Steppes have more of his information.

She must have had allies. Anything that points us to people close to her would help.

Check it out, will you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Drink always seems to be empty... why's me drink always empty?

==Completion==
Ah, Windsor...

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|Vanessa, we must consider the possibility that there is something going on in your [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]] that you don't know about.}}
:{{Text|Emote|Vanessa pauses a moment.}}
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|It's true I haven't been home in awhile. It's possible they are... restless.}}
:{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|Onyxia's power to manipulate still lies in that amulet. Who knows the damage it could cause? A riot? A civil war?}}

Speak with Ragged John:
:{{Gossip|The Drakefire Amulet has been stolen. Did Windsor have any other information on it or Onyxia?}}
::Who... da... what?

::<nowiki>*hic*</nowiki>

::Ye drunk? Yer not makin' any lick o' sense.
::{{Gossip|Windsor. Reginald Windsor. What else did he know?}}
:::Windsor? Oh aye, Windsor... what a fine fellow. Gone to the dirt, now. Took a whole dragon to finally take 'im down, I heard. 

:::Got it all in 'is head that some fine noble lady was actually a dragon and then... he was right! Windsor always was somethin' special.

:::{{Gossip|Yes. He was. Please tell me if he knew anything else about that dragon and her stuff.}}
::::Her stuff? Well, I dunno nothin' bout HER stuff. 

::::I did gather together what I could find of Windsor's ol stuff, though. Thought maybe his family would want it... or maybe [[Stormwind]] would put up a memorial or somethin'. 

::::But then I found out 'is family's all dead. And didn't hear nuthin' from Stormwind. Merchant came by and said it was ol' [[Bolvar Fordragon]] who did all the work of revealing Onyxia!

::::{{Gossip|Windsor's old belongings will do. Where did you put them?}}
:::::Hey now, I weren't done yet!

:::::Firstly, some folks come through and say it was Mister Fordragon. Then, someone comes along and says it was some champion I ain't even ever heard of! And THEN, someone even tried ta tell me it was ol' [[Varian Wrynn]]--rest his fine soul--that confronted Onyxia!

:::::Now look 'ere--I don't got nuthin against Old Man Wrynn, and [[Anduin Wrynn|his son]] seemed fine enough, too, but I ain't heard a peep about my old pal Windsor. He didn't get an ounce of credit!

:::::Now that just ain't right.

:::::{{Gossip|Yes, it's terrible. Now please just tell me where you put his stuff.}}
:::::{{Gossip|Enough is enough, John. Just tell me where Windsor's stuff is. {{Text|red|<Skip this conversation.>}}}}
::::::Nu-uh. I'm not... *hic*

::::::I'm not lettin' 'is memory get... taken advantage of again. 

::::::<Ragged John tears up.>

::::::I shouldn'ta left 'im with those [[orc]]s in the first place. Maybe then... he'd never have died tryin to go after that dragon...

::::::{{Gossip|I won't let his memory go to waste, John.}}
::::::{{Gossip|Enough is enough, John. Just tell me where Windsor's stuff is. {{Text|red|<Skip this conversation.>}}}}
:::::::Ye won't? 

:::::::Do ye promise? 

:::::::Will ye... will ye get 'im one of those fancy memorials in Stormwind, like Old Man Wrynn's got? Like all the heroes get? 

:::::::Because he was a 'ero.

:::::::{{Gossip|I will see what I can do.}}
:::::::{{Gossip|Enough is enough, John. Just tell me where Windsor's stuff is. {{Text|red|<Skip this conversation.>}}}}
::::::::I... okay. *hic* I trust ya.

::::::::What did ye want again?

::::::::{{Gossip|Windsor's old stuff. Where is it?}}
::::::::{{Gossip|Enough is enough, John. Just tell me where Windsor's stuff is. {{Text|red|<Skip this conversation.>}}}}
:::::::::Ach, right. 

:::::::::Well... thing is... *hic*

:::::::::... I don't exactly... have it on meself at the moment.

:::::::::{{Gossip|What do you mean?}}
:::::::::{{Gossip|Enough is enough, John. Just tell me where Windsor's stuff is. {{Text|red|<Skip this conversation.>}}}}
::::::::::Well, see 'ere. Windsor spent a lot of time at [[Blackrock Mountain]]. That's a long way!

::::::::::A few weeks ago, when I finally was bringin' all 'is stuff I found back here, I was attacked by a [[Vicious Elder Ember Worg|giant wolf]]!

::::::::::Now, before ye say anything, understand here that it was the biggest, giantest wolf I ever did see. It's eyes were the size of my whole body! It's claws were like... like... like somethin' real big-like.

::::::::::Trust me, it ain't no wolf you wanna mess with. So... I ran. And I might've... lost Windsor's stuff along the way. The wolf grabbed the pack and ran back to 'is den! It's probably long gone... just a chew toy...

::::::::::{{Gossip|<Ask about something else.>}}

If you have the original [[Drakefire Amulet]], the dialogue with Ragged John changes slightly:

:{{Gossip|Hello again, John.}}
::Who... da... what?

::<nowiki>*hic*</nowiki>

::Who're ye?

::{{Gossip|A friend of Windsor's, remember?}}
:::Windsor? Oh aye, Windsor... what a fine fellow. Gone to the dirt, now. Took a whole dragon to finally take 'im down, I heard. 

:::Got it all in 'is head that some fine noble lady was actually a dragon and then... he was right! Windsor always was somethin' special.

:::{{Gossip|Yes, John, I was there.}}
::::<John peers at you.>

::::Er... yeah. Sure ye were.

::::{{Gossip|I'm looking for more information he may have dug up on Onyxia and her stuff.}}
:::::Hmm... 

:::::I did gather together what I could find of Windsor's ol stuff, though. Thought maybe his family would want it... or maybe [[Stormwind]] would put up a memorial or somethin'. 

:::::But then I found out 'is family's all dead. And didn't hear nuthin' from Stormwind. Merchant came by and said it was ol' [[Bolvar Fordragon]] who did all the work of revealing Onyxia!

::::::Now that just ain't right.

::::::{{Gossip|Yes, John, that was me with Windsor. You've met me. Are you even listening?}}
::::::{{Gossip|Enough is enough, John. Just tell me where Windsor's stuff is. {{Text|red|<Skip this conversation.>}}}}
:::::::Nu-uh. I'm not... *hic*

:::::::I'm not lettin' 'is memory get... taken advantage of again. 

:::::::<Ragged John tears up.>
