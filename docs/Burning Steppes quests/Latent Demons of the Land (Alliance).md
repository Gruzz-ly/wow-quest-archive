== Objectives ==
Obtain 18 Fallen Flamekin.
*[[Fallen Flamekin]] x18

== Description ==
The lava beds nearby - to the west - play host to [[flamekin]], a brand of fire [[demon]] that has long roamed [[Burning Steppes|the steppes]]. Situations are such in the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock army]] that, if we are careful, we may be able to sneak some of these flamekin behind enemy lines to cause some havoc.

Bring me the bodies of several flamekin. As demons, they are easily resurrected, and then we can use them for our own purposes.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

== Progress ==
The flamekin are weak, but they travel in packs. Be cautious.

== Completion ==
To the untrained eye, these will look exactly like [[imp]]s.

We'll just need to get them to that untrained eye. I'll work on preparing them for delivery.

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[SEVEN! YUP!]], [[Blackened Ashes]] and [[A Heap of Delicious Worg]] before heading out. Circle around to the southwest. Plenty of flamekin and flameflies in the pass to Redridge. Flamekin come in groups of three, with low health and weak attacks.

==Progression==
{{Burning Steppes storyline}}
