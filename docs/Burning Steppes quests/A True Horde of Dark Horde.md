==Objectives==
Defeat 15 [[Dark Horde]] troops and 3 Dark Horde Sergeants.
*Dark Horde Troops defeated (15)
*Dark Horde Sergeants defeated (3)

==Description==
The remaining Dark Horde forces are gathered here, <name>. Many of them look to be untrained and new to the cause. Defeating their warlord will leave them in a state of chaos and confusion, but we also need to deal with these recruits.

Drive away the forces gathered here. With no leaders, and no one new to rally around, we can hope to see some peace in this region--for the first time in decades.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
You killed a lot of them, but I watched even more run away.

Let's hope they never return.

==Notes==
Make sure you accept [[Warriors without a Warlord]] as well.

[[Arator the Redeemer]] shall accompany you. 

Slay a whole ton of Dark Horde Sergeants and Troops.

Head to Danath Trollbane and turn in both quests.
