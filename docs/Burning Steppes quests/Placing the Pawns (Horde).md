== Objectives ==
Return to {{NPC||Eitrigg}} at [[Flame Crest]] in [[Burning Steppes]].

== Description ==
<You hear a buzzing in your ear.>

<Name>. It sounds like you and {{NPC||Ariok}} have finished with your tasks. I've also finished mine.

Return to Flame Crest. I've prepared a few packages to deliver to the Big Three: {{NPC||General Thorg'izog||Thorg'izog}}, {{NPC||Dragon-Lord Neeralak||Neeralak}}, and {{NPC||High Warlock Xi'lun||Xi'lun}}. You've already met General Thorg'izog. This will be your chance to meet the other two.

That is, before you kill them.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Breastplate of the Undercover Thorium Brother|Subversive Steps|Flame Crest Bracers|Pawn's Bracers}}
You will also receive: {{cost||75}}

== Completion ==
Good, you're back.

I hope you've still got that disguise. You're going back undercover, <name>.

== Notes ==
Planned correctly, players should have killed the last dragonspawn just outside Flame Crest. If not, oh well. More experience. Either way, head back to Eitrigg to turn in.

On complete, Ariok leaves the player's party and the [[Blackrock Disguise]] is found. Huzzah! However, should something happen to it, talk to Eitrigg. He has another.
