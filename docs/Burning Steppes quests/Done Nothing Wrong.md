== Objectives ==
Obtain a Freed Red Whelping, a Freed Green Whelping, a Freed Blue Whelping, and a Freed Bronze Whelping.
*[[Freed Red Whelpling]]
*[[Freed Green Whelpling]]
*[[Freed Blue Whelpling]]
*[[Freed Bronze Whelpling]]

== Description ==
The [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orcs]] of [[Burning Steppes|the steppes]] serve a {{NPC||Nefarian||dark master}} - one who performs twisted experiments to create [[chromatic dragonflight|his own menagerie]] of abominations. Many of his test subjects are as corrupted as their master, but others are completely innocent.

In the [[Whelping Downs|whelping downs]] to the south, they chain baby dragons to the ground, preparing them for such experiments. I will not stand for this. Break their fetters and return the hatchlings to me... to safety.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Flamestar Amulet
|Hatchlings' Protector
|Whelp Keeper's Staff
|Clutch Rearrangement Tool
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
I hope we weren't too late.

== Completion ==
I will see to it that these dragons are taken care of.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Burning Vengeance]] before heading out. The whelpings are chained to the ground, so they should not be too hard to find. A large group can be found in the cave at {{co|22.3|67.8|Burning Steppes}} to the south of the grounds up in the hills.

On complete:
:{{text|yell|John J. Keeshan/Ariok|Flamestar! I can return these dragons to their kind. Let me take care of them.}}
:{{text|say|Mouton Flamestar|As you wish. Just make sure they don't come to no harm.}}
