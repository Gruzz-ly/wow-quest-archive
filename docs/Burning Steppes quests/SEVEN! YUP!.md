== Objectives ==
Gather 7 [[Flamefly|Flameflies]].
*[[Flamefly (item)]] x7

== Description ==
We have to take action.  Winky and [[Gor'tesh]] were fighting, so I planned this friendship ceremony to help the two of them make up.  Everything was going well, until...

Well, you know the rest.

I even brought drinks!

Winky loves flameflies.  He runs off to chase them most every night.  I'm thinking maybe that's where he went.  You'll find flameflies to the west and north, wherever you find lava.  Bring me seven of them, and hurry!

Gor'tesh might leave next!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Gor'Tesh's Boots|Flamefly Spaulders|Belly Rubbers}}
{{itembox|You will also receive: {{cost||75}}
|Tiny Flamefly}}

== Progress ==
<Oralius grasps at the air, lifts his fist, and peers hopefully between his clenched fingers.>

== Completion ==
You'll never guess what happened!  Winky came back!  No flameflies needed.

Can a dwarf get a celebratory belly rub?  Come on now!  RUBBA MAH BELLY!

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Blackened Ashes]], [[Latent Demons of the Land]] and [[A Heap of Delicious Worg]] before heading out. Circle around to the southwest. Plenty of [[flamekin]] and flameflies in the pass to Redridge.

This is a reference to the pre-''Cataclysm'' quest [[FIFTY! YEP!]] also given by [[Oralius]] where a player had to collect fifty [[Blackrock Medallion]]s from the Blackrock orcs in the zone.

During the beta, [[Flamefly Net]] was provided.
