== Objectives ==
Deliver the Rescued Whelplings to {{NPC||Acride}} at [[Slither Rock]] in [[Burning Steppes]].
*[[Rescued Whelplings]] (provided)

== Description ==
While we are circling around [[Dreadmaul Rock]], there's one more stop that we need to make. You remember the hatchlings that you freed from the [[Whelping Downs]]? I've been watching over them, and now we're going to deliver them to someone who will take care of them better than we can. He's staying in Slither Rock, to the northeast of Dreadmaul Rock.

His name is Acride, and he might be the key to victory in the upcoming battle.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

== Progress ==
You've arrived, <name>.

== Completion ==
Yes, the whelplings. I will take care of them.

As for the agreement I made with your father earlier, tell him that I will hold up my end of the bargain. You will have your dragon for the battle against the orcs.

We share your grudge against the [[Blackrock clan]].

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Blood Tour]] and [[Draconic Vanguard]] before heading out. Accepting the first of these three quests will put Ariok in the player's party. Accept the rest of them before leaving Flame Crest. First, exit camp and turn west to reach the southwestern rally point by the pass to Redridge. Kill Akumi, then circle around Dreadmaul Rock counterclockwise to the northeast. Slither Rock is to the northeast of Dreadmaul Rock, and Acride can be found inside.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Acride|Your conspirator has informed me of your plan. I shall see you on the battlefield... painted with the ashes of the elementals.}}
The four whelps are also freed, hovering around Acride.

Complete all three quests and Eitrigg will radio in with [[Placing the Pawns]].
