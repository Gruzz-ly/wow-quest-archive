== Objectives ==
Return to {{NPC||Colonel Troteman}} at [[Morgan's Vigil]] in [[Burning Steppes]].

== Description ==
<Name>. It sounds like you and {{NPC||John J. Keeshan||Keeshan}} have finished with your tasks. I've also finished mine.

Return to Morgan's Vigil. I've prepared a few packages to deliver to the Big Three: {{NPC||General Thorg'izog||Thorg'izog}}, {{NPC||Dragon-Lord Neeralak||Neeralak}}, and {{NPC||High Warlock Xi'lun||Xi'lun}}. You've already met General Thorg'izog. This will be your chance to meet the other two.

That is, before we kill them.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Breastplate of the Undercover Thorium Brother|Subversive Steps|Bracers of Vigil|Pawn's Bracers}}
You will also receive: {{cost||75}}

== Completion ==
Good, you're back.

I hope you've still got that disguise. You're going back undercover, <name>.

== Notes ==
Planned correctly, players should have killed the last dragonspawn just outside Morgan's Vigil. If not, oh well. More experience. Either way, head back to Troteman to turn in.

On complete, Keeshan leaves the player's party and the [[Blackrock Disguise]] is found. Huzzah! However, should something happen to it, talk to Troteman. He has another.
