==Objectives==
Slay 200 Blackrock Invaders. If you should lose your vehicle, use the Horn of the Callers to summon it again.
*Blackrock Invader slain x200
*[[Horn of the Callers (3)]] (provided)

==Description==
This is it, <name>. This is where it hits the fan. Where all the pieces come together.

Strap in, and come with me. We're going to go talk to [[Acride]] and call in that favor that he owes us. Then we'll stop this invasion of [[Redridge Mountains|Redridge]] before it even starts.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|2|30}}

==Progress==
Now's our chance! Crush them! We won't get another opportunity like this!

==Completion==
Did you see them run? They didn't know what was happening! Beautiful!

Our job's almost done, <name>. It's time to deliver the deathblow.

==Notes==
Accept the quest and a cutscene begins:
:{{text|bossemote|Meanwhile, atop Dreadmaul Rock...}}
:''The camera flies away to the top of Dreadmaul Rock where the Big Three are holding a war conference. Thorg'izog is trying to cover for something and Neeralak is covered with soot...''
:{{text|say|High Warlock Xi'lun|We are nearly prepared to start this battle, brothers. Thorg'izog, what is the matter? Why are you covering your butt like that?}}
:{{text|say|General Thorg'izog|WHAT? No reason... it's just... something is very wrong with my stomach. I think it's something I ate.}}
:{{text|say|High Warlock Xi'lun|Can you still lead your troops? Do you need to promote one of your sergeants?}}
:{{text|say|General Thorg'izog|[[Voodooist Timan|Timan]] fell from the [[Pillar of Ash]]. [[Worgmistress Otahna|Otahna]] was eaten by wolves. [[Gorlop]] fell in lava. And most of [[Blackrock Sergeant|my sergeants]] were killed in a [[Abuse of Power|freak cudgelling accident]].}}
:{{text|say|High Warlock Xi'lun|I see. Well, do the best you can. Neeralak, why are you all black and smoky?}}
:{{text|say|Dragon-Lord Neeralak|Those [[imp]]s you had delivered... they woke up and started shooting fireballs at everybody! It was chaos!}}
:{{text|say|High Warlock Xi'lun|Delivered? Woke up? What are you even talking about? Were you attacked by [[flamekin]]?}}
:{{text|say|Dragon-Lord Neeralak|Imps, flamekin, whatever! I don't know [[warlock]] crap. [[Demon]]s all look the same to me!}}
:{{text|say|Dragon-Lord Neeralak|Besides, I've been busy dealing with other issues. Dozens of [[black dragonflight|my dragons]] died when those two enemies swept through the front lines.}}
:{{text|say|High Warlock Xi'lun|You're both failures. But it doesn't matter: with a [[pit lord]] on our side, we won't need foot soldiers OR dragons. Behold!}}
:''The camera pulls away as Xi'lun walks away to attempt to summon the pit lord...''
:{{text|say|High Warlock Xi'lun|[Demonic] Zar zar refir zenn X zennshi x buras daz.}}
:''{{NPC||Hellmondath}}, an elite pit lord appears!''
:{{text|say|High Warlock Xi'lun|And now to quickly use the Orb of Domination, before the pit lord turns on us.}}
:''The "orb" fails, and Hellmondath starts attacking the blackrock army! The camera pulls back up to Neeralak and Thorg'izog.''
:{{text|say|General Thorg'izog|The pit lord's loose! We're doomed! Retreat!}}
:{{text|say|General Thorg'izog|Quickly, everyone run toward those dragons! All troops, towards the dragons! The dragons will save us!}}
:{{text|say|Dragon-Lord Neeralak|I never called any dragons...}}
The cutscene cuts to a close as the player is mounted upon the Obsidian-Cloaked Dragon. Laughing. Laughing very hard.
:{{text|bossemote|The Blackrock forces are panicking! Strike at them now!}}
The dragon has one ability:
*{{abilities|Fiery Breath|Fires a bolt of fiery breath at enemy targets, inflicting 15000 damage to all Blackrock Invaders.}}
Fiery Breath is more than enough to one-shot the members of the Blackrock army caught in the blast radius. Take out 200 and fly back to [[Morgan's Vigil]].
