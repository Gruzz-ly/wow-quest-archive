==Objectives==
Defend yourself from [[poacher]]s and recover the rest of [[Numi]]'s materials.
*[[Vertically Composited Patch Hampler]] (5)
*[[Brass-fitted Flam-Tamp Flange]] (5)

==Description==
Picking up the bag, you immediately notice it's nearly empty. Somehow you get the impression Numi wont{{sic}} trade the book for the bag by itself. But what's not empty, is the camp. You'd better defend yourself and keep your eyes peeled for more of this stuff.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||90}}
*6600 [[XP]]
*[[Structural Dynamics of Flow]]
*[[Warmed Rumsey Rum with Cream]]

==Progress==
Have you found the red bag yet? I need that stuff back if I'm going to finish these telescope upgrades in time for meteorite season!

==Completion==
Well, you turned out to be quite resourceful! These materials are irreplaceable to me. I can't thank you enough! Here, like I promised you, is the book [[Sebastian Jurgens|Jurgens]] wants back. Please, take this hot beverage with you before leaving, it's cold out there.

==Progression==
