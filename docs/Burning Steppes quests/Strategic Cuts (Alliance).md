==Description==
<Static> <Name>...  <Name>, can you hear me?  It's [[Colonel Troteman|Troteman]].

Listen, we've just received the final bit of intel for your next mission.  There are three marks that we'd like you take down.  The first is Voodooist Timan, whom you'll find atop the Pillar of Ash.  Worgmistress Othana is in the central [[worg]] pens.  Finally, Gorlop is near the [[lava]] pools to the south.

You will find the scorpid barbs you harvested packed along with your belongings.  Use the barbs on the marks when the time is right.

==Completion==
{{questportrait|Colonel Troteman.jpg|Colonel Troteman|You're pretty handy with a stinger, kid.}}
Not only did you pull off the executions, you made them all look like accidents!

You were the right <race> for this undercover work.  Good job, soldier.

==Notes==
Before leaving Kaoshin's location outside the Pillar of Ash, Troteman radios in with this quest. Head to the top to find Voodoist Timan looking out over the hovel. Use the scorpid barb on him.
:{{text|yell|Voodooist Timan|OW, MON!}}
:{{text|yell|Voodooist Timan|HEX YOU!  HEX YOU!  HEX YOU!}}
:''Timan falls off the tower, but not before he gets a [[Hex]] off on the player.''

Worgmistress Othana can be found in the worg pens in the center of camp at {{co|39.2|56.2|Burning Steppes}} shouting invective at the worgs:
*{{text|say|Worgmistress Othana|You stupid mongrels!  I ought to whip you all to death!}}
*{{text|say|Worgmistress Othana|Quit your whining, you worthless wolves!}}
*{{text|say|Worgmistress Othana|You wolves are worthless!  Worthless!}}
*{{text|say|Worgmistress Othana|You stinking curs had better enjoy the taste of my whip!}}
*{{text|say|Worgmistress Othana|I'll make you bleed, you weak little sacks of bones!}}

Tag her with the scorpid barb to stun her:
:{{text|say|Worgmistress Othana|Ahh!  I... I can't move!}}
:''The worgs move in...''
:{{text|say|Worgmistress Othana|No... no... get them away from me!}}
:{{text|yell|Worgmistress Othana|NO!  AHHHHHHH!!!!}}
:''The worgs help themselves to some sweet, sweet justice by eating Othana alive.''

Gorlop is running back and forth between lava pools at {{co|39.9|60.5|Burning Steppes}} and {{co|43.9|60.1|Burning Steppes}} on the south side of the hovel.
:{{text|say|Gorlop|Gorlop wonder if other lava hot?}}
:''He runs to the other lava pool.''
:{{text|say|Gorlop|This lava hot.}}
:''He waits for a few seconds, then wonders about the other pool...''

Tag Gorlop with the barb:
:{{text|yell|Gorlop|OWIE!  GORLOP CAN'T MOVE!  GORLOP GONNA FALL!}}
:''Gorlop falls into the lava pool and dies.''
After killing the third target, the quest automatically completes.
