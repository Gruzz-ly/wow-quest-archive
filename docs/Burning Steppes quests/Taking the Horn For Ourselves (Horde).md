== Objectives ==
Bring the Horn of the Callers back to {{NPC||Eitrigg}} at [[Chiselgrip]] in [[Burning Steppes]].
*[[Horn of the Callers (2)]] (provided)

== Description ==
<Name>, it's Eitrigg. I want you to hold on to that horn. I'm sure we can improvise and find a way to work it into the plan.

I'm more than a little concerned what {{NPC||Quartermaster Kaoshin||Kaoshin}} said about attacking [[Redridge Mountains|Redrige]]. We knew an attack was imminent, but not this soon!

Return to me, with the horn. We will talk again here, in Chiselgrip. And try not to ruin that disguise. You're not done with your undercover work yet.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Helm of Serendipity|Improvised Breastplate|Leggings of the Steppes}}
You will also receive: {{cost||75}}

== Progress ==
Welcome back, soldier.

== Completion ==
True, an attack on Redridge is an attack against the [[Alliance]]... but it is also an attack against innocents.

I won't stand for that.  Not as a Crusader.  Not as an orc.

It's time we taught the Blackrock clan - my old clan - that their raiding days are over. 

== Notes ==
Back to Chiselgrip, to the north.
