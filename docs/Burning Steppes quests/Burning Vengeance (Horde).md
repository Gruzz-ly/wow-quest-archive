== Objectives ==
Slay 5 Blackrock Whelpers and 5 Flamescale Broodlings.
*[[Blackrock Whelper]] Slain (5)
*[[Flamescale Broodling]] Slain (5)

== Description ==
I am a [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orc]] by birth. I spent a large part of my youth inside that [[Blackrock Mountain|mountain]].

<[[Ariok]] motions towards Blackrock Mountain, to the north.>

But while I share blood with them, I do not share their outlook. And I am seeking an ally to assist me in stopping their upcoming attack.

So prove yourself. Travel south, to the [[Whelping Downs]], and slay their whelpers and the hatchling black dragons. Prove to me that you're ready for this war.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

== Progress ==
I suppose you don't have what it takes.

That's fine. I can fight this war myself.

== Completion ==
So you're in, then?

Good.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Done Nothing Wrong]] before heading out. The whelplings you save for that quest are in the same area.
