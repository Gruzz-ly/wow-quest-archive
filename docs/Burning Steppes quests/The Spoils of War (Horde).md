==Objectives==
Inspect the [[Crate of Left Over Supplies|Box of Left Over Supplies]] at [[Flame Crest]] in [[Burning Steppes]].

==Description==
While the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orcs]] still swarm in [[Blackrock Spire|their spire]], I doubt their plans will take them anywhere near the innocent people of [[Redridge Mountains|Redridge]] anytime soon. You and [[Ariok]] saw to that.

I'd say we were fairly resourceful here in Burning Steppes - those warlock supplies we collected certainly came in handy, as did the obsidian ash that we used to conceal our dragon.

There were, however, some collected items left over. Please, take your pick before you move on, beyond the steppes.
