== Objectives ==
Obtain 9 piles of Obsidian Ash.
*[[Obsidian Ashes]] x9

== Description ==
I need you to do some more gathering before we can go take out the remainder of the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]] army. If we're going to do this, we're going to do it right, and that means being prepared.

I need ash, <name>. Not just any ash... ash from the {{NPC||Greater Obsidian Elemental||greater obsidian elementals}} that roam the plains to the southeast. The stuff is deep, deep black, which is what we need for our next disguise.

Don't worry, you've already got a disguise. This one is for someone... well, someTHING... else.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

== Progress ==
The ashes of the obsidian elementals are particularly dark - exactly what we need for our purposes.

== Completion ==
Yes, these will do. I will get this packed up for you.

== Notes ==
Pick up all of [[Not Fireflies, Flameflies]], [[Latent Demons of the Land]] and [[A Heap of Delicious Worg]] before heading out. Head to the southeast. The elementals can be found past the [[Ruins of Thaurissan]].

==Progression==
