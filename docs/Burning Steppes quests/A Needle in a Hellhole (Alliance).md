== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Thelaron Direneedle}} at [[Chiselgrip]] in [[Burning Steppes]].

== Description ==
You and I can't take on an army, <name>. They'll overwhelm us. That's why we've got to stick to {{NPC||Colonel Troteman||Troteman's}} plan.

The next part of the plan is going to require a bit of subtlety... something that I'm not terribly good at. That's where you come in.

Speak with Thelaron Direneedle, the tailor here in town. I've already given him the hides and mud that we've collected. He's going to need to size you.

That's right, <name>: you're going undercover.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

== Completion ==
You need a disguise? Well, you came to the right place, sister ''(if female)'' / honey ''(if male)''.

Let me take a look... mm-hmm. I know exactly what we'll do.

== Notes ==
Just 40 yards to the west or so...
