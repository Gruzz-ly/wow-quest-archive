|-|
Goblin=Judging by your weight, build, and size, we're going to dress you as a [[goblin]]. The [[Blackrock clan|Blackrocks]] have been known to hire goblin [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] to fill their ranks, so you'll fit right in.

Do you know much about [[tailoring]]? If not, then consider this your first lesson. My crafting table over there has all the necessary supplies on it.

Go ahead and grab whatever you think is necessary, then bring it here. Thelaron will fix you right up.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|45}}

==Progress==
We're not done yet, you little <class>!

==Completion==
That's it?  That's your disguise?  I'm feeling less confident about our chances.

But still confident.

==Notes==
The Tailor's Table is right next to him. Interact with it:
:Several piles of supplies rest on the table. You decide to start with the worg hides.
:{{gossip|Investigate the hides.}}
:You see the stack of worg hides that you collected earlier. These will be used for the bulk of your costume.
:{{gossip|Take <one-four> hide(s).}}
:Looking over, you see the obsidian-flecked mud that you collected from the lava beds. This will be used to color your disguise.
:{{gossip|Take <one-four> handful(s) of mud.}}
:Finally, you see some thread, which will be used to hold the disguise together.
:{{gossip|Take <one-four> spool(s) of thread.}}
:You have gathered your supplies. Bring them to Thelaron Direneedle to assemble.

Talk to Thelaron... His reaction varies based on the amount of items players selected.

| 1 ||1-2 || 1-4 ||We're going to need some more mud to properly color your disguise.

On producing the proper ratio of items, players will be handed the [[Blackrock Disguise]]. Go turn in to Eitrigg. The ratio varies for each race of the Horde: <!--Based on comments on wowhead for the quest-->
