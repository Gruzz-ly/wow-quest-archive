== Objectives ==
Obtain 5 Razor-Sharp Scorpid Barbs.
*[[Razor-Sharp Scorpid Barb]]  x5

== Description ==
If we're going to wage war against the [[Blackrock clan]], we're going to need to plan ahead. My father has already put the plan together - now it's time to execute.

I need scorpid stingers... the sharpest ones you can find. [[Scorpid]]s are all over the steppes, but you can find most of them in the gulch to the west.

Don't worry about what they're for. You'll find out soon enough.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sharp Scorpid Barb
|Enchanted Scorpid Tail
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
Back already?

== Completion ==
Those scorpids are easy to underestimate.  You're lucky you didn't end up on the end of one of these barbs.  Or maybe you're just good.

I'll add these to the stockpile.  We're not done yet, <race>. 

==Notes==
Also pick up [[A Future Project]] and [[Mud Hunter]] before heading out. Circle around to the northwest to find plenty of scorpids and worgs.

==Progression==
