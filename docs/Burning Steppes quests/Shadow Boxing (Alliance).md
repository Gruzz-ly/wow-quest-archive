== Objectives ==
Slay Ner'gosh the Shadow.
*[[Ner'gosh the Shadow]] slain

== Description ==
Ner'gosh the Shadow is the leader of those [[warlock]]s to our north. He's the jerk that kicked me out of my home once those [[Blackrock clan|Blackrock orcs]] started showing up. Well, they're all jerks, but he's the jerkiest.

If I'm ever going to move back in near the [[Altar of Storms (Burning Steppes)|Altar]], Ner'gosh has to go.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||75}}

== Progress ==
Go ahead. Kill him!

== Completion ==
Knowing the way those orcs operate, there'll be another one to take his place soon. I'll see if I can't sneak back into the altar before that happens.

Thanks, my dear ''(if female)'' / buddy ''(if male)''.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Warlocks Have the Neatest Stuff]] before heading out. After collecting Wildeyes's stuff from his place to the west, head east up to the Altar itself. Ner'gosh is standing at {{co|9.9|29.7|Burning Steppes}} in the center. He is a level 50 orc with 3544 health, Demon Armor, Shadow Bolt and Corruption.
