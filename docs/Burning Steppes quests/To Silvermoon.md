==Objectives==
Return to [[Silvermoon]].

==Description==
Thank you for all your help, <name>. It's strange to hold what remains of [[Turalyon|my father]]'s shield and know that, prior to [[Siege of Blackrock Spire|that day]], he was such a defender of others.

I feel I've only seen his aggressive side. I realize he means well, but I don't think...

That is not the path for me.

Regardless, let's return to Silvermoon and put these relics we've gathered to work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
We certainly did some good in the Burning Steppes, <name>, and recovered the fragments of Turalyon's shield.

Arator seems excited to see it re-forged.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Arator|If I repair the shield, maybe it can remind my father of the kind of [[paladin]] he wanted to be.}}
:''Alonsus Faol uses the [[Grimoire of Teleportation]] to open the portal to Silvermoon.''
:{{Text|Say|[[Kurdran Wildhammer]]|Faol, I hope you know what you are doing.}}
:''Arator and Alonsus departed by taking the portal to Silvermoon leaving [[Danath Trollbane]], [[Eitrigg]], and Kurdran Wildhammer.''

Use the portal to go to Silvermoon.

Upon arriving at Silvermoon, Arator begins to go down the ramp.
:{{Text|Say|Arator|<Name>, join me at the forge. I'll need your help with the shield.}}
