== Objectives ==
Kill General Thorg'izog, Dragon-Lord Neeralak, and High Warlock Xi'lun.
*[[General Thorg'izog]] slain
*[[Dragon-Lord Neeralak]] slain
*[[High Warlock Xi'lun]] slain

== Description ==
You and [[John J. Keeshan|Keeshan]] are going back to [[Dreadmaul Rock|that mountain]]. There's three [[orc]]s who survived [[Assault on Dreadmaul Rock|the attack]], and we won't rest until they're dead.

That's right, I'm talking about the Big Three.

General Thorg'izog crawled back into the [[Firegut Furnace]], and Dragon-Lord Neeralak is cowering in the cave on the mountain's peak. Xi'lun is in the back of the [[Skull Warren]], plotting with his fellow warlocks.

Leave your mark, <name>. Hunt down those sniveling [[Blackrock clan|Blackrocks]], and teach them the might of [[Redridge Mountains|Redridge]]!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|2|30}}

== Progress ==
Good luck, soldier.

== Completion ==
<Colonel Troteman is beaming.>

Welcome home, you two.

== Notes ==
Keeshan joins the player's party again. The field is littered with corpses of the Blackrock army, but it was not completely wiped out. Hellmondath also fell, incredibly enough. The ogres of Firegut Furnace are all seated, for some reason. Head in and keep taking lefts to find and kill Thorg'izog. Exit the cave and head north to get to the trailhead leading to the top of Dreadmaul, guarded by three ogres. Kill a path to the top, then kill Neeralak. Head northeast and jump down to reach the mouth of the Skull Warren. Enter it and keep taking left forks to reach the bottom of the cave system. Often, the warlocks and flamekin will keep each other occupied. Xi'lun and his Felhunter Minion can be found all the way down at the bottom.
