==Objectives==
Use the Blackrock Cudgel of Discipline on 20 troops in the [[Fields of Honor]]. If one of the troops discovers your disguise, cudgel him to death before he can unmask you.
*Blackrock minions cudgeled x20
*[[Blackrock Cudgel of Discipline]] (provided)

==Description==
I've been looking for a good, strong soldier like you. I need someone to keep my troops in line.

Outside [[Blackrock Stronghold|the stronghold]], you will find [[orc]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[troll]]s preparing for the assault on [[Redridge Mountains|Redrige]]. My sergeants keep them in line, but I'd like you to assist them.

Take this cudgel and discipline a few of my soldiers. I don't care if they're misbehaving or standing perfectly in line, I want them beaten. I want them focused, battle-hardened, and obedient.

Now go.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|50}}

==Progress==
Do I have to use the cudgel on you, soldier? Get back out there!

==Completion==
I have a feeling we'll be hearing about you and your exploits for a long time, soldier. I look forward to fighting by your side in Redridge.

You are dismissed.

==Notes==
On accept, [[Colonel Troteman]] (if [[Alliance]]) or [[Eitrigg]] (if [[Horde]]) radios in with [[Abuse of Power]]. Accept it before getting started. Outside, the Cudgel hits for a quarter of the target's health, and does not have a cooldown, global or otherwise. The minions, most of the time, will take a single hit and nothing will happen.
*{{text|say|Sorry!  Won't happen again, sir!}}
*{{text|say|Hey!  Who gave you the cudgel?}}
*{{text|say|It wasn't me, I swear!  You can't prove anything!}}
*{{text|say|Ouch!  What did I do?}}

Occasionally, they will notice the mask:
*{{text|say|I don't recognize you...}}
*{{text|say|Hey, wait a minute...}}
*{{text|say|Hmm... are you new around here...?}}
*{{text|say|You're not one of us, are you...?}}
:{{text|bossemote|You've been spotted! Club your target to death before you are unmasked!}}

Players have five seconds to beat the minion to death before the mask is pulled off and every unit turns hostile! Note that the minion stays friendly, so normal attacks will not work.
