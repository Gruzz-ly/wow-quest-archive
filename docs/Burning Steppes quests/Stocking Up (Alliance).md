== Objectives ==
Obtain 5 Razor-Sharp Scorpid Barbs.
*[[Razor-Sharp Scorpid Barb]] x5

== Description ==
If we're going to wage war against the [[Blackrock clan]], we're going to need to plan ahead. {{NPC||Colonel Troteman||My colonel}} has already put the plan together - now it's time to execute.

I need some [[scorpid]] stingers... the sharpest ones you can find. Scorpids are all over the [[Burning Steppes|steppes]], but you can find most of them in the gulch to the west.

Don't worry about what they're for. You'll find out soon enough.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sharp Scorpid Barb
|Enchanted Scorpid Tail
|Envenomed Scorpid Tail
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|77|50}}
* 2,100 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
Back already?

== Completion ==
Those scorpids are easy to underestimate. You're lucky you didn't end up on the end of one of those barbs. Or maybe you're just good.

I'll add these to the stockpile. We're not done yet, <race>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Future Project]] and [[Mud Hunter]] before heading out. Circle around to the northwest to find plenty of scorpids and worgs.

==Progression==
{{Burning Steppes storyline}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 7.3.5|note=[[Enchanted Scorpid Tail]] and [[Envenomed Scorpid Tail]] added as rewards.}}
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
