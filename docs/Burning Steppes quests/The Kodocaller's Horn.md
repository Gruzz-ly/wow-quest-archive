==Objectives==
Use the Horn of the Callers to call 7 Blackrock War Kodos [[Black Tooth Hovel|back to camp]]. If a kodo turns hostile, fight it until it submits.
*[[Blackrock War Kodo]]s summoned back to camp x7
*[[Horn of the Callers]] (provided)

== Description ==
Alright, I've got some actual, legitimate, important work for you.  We've got to call the [[kodo]]s in from the grazing lands to the south.  [[General Thorg'izog]] says we'll be moving out into [[Redridge Mountains|Redrige]] soon, and I won't be caught with my kodos down.

Use this horn near a kodo.  It will return to the camp when it hears the call.

You'll want to watch out.  Sometimes the kodos get a little fiesty, so you need to knock them around a bit before they listen to you.

==Completion==
Your job is complete.  You take a look at the horn that they gave you, and decide to hang onto it for a while longer.

==Notes==
Back to the south. If they turn hostile, knock them down to below 75% of their health. The quest completes automatically once seven have returned, and the followup, [[Taking the Horn For Ourselves]] is automatically offered next.
