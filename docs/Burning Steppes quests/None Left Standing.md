==Objectives==
Burn 6 [[Dark Horde]] [[banner]]s.
*Dark Horde banners burned (6)
*[[Torch (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
The one thing worse than seeing this Dark Horde here is their banners. Take this torch, and burn down every one.

This will help break their spine, dispelling the idea that they are legitimate or deserving of power.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 12,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I hope that this might demoralize some of these soldiers out of their misguided devotion to a failed cause.

Regardless, I am glad those banners are not flying any longer.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting [[The Dark Horde]], '''None Left Standing''', & [[Faithful Servant, Faithless Cause]]
:{{Text|Say|[[Danath Trollbane]]|Come [[Kurdran Wildhammer|Kurdran]], we should scout out the other Dark Horde encampments.}}
:{{Text|Say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Pfft--The Dark Horde. They're stuck trying to win the [[Second War]] while we've made peace on the [[Fourth War|Fourth]]. Get with the times!}}
:''Danath Trollbane & Kurdran Wildhammer who mounted on [[Sky'reen]] took off.''

[[Arator the Redeemer]] shall accompany you. 

;Upon burning 3 banners
:{{Text|Say|Arator|The Dark Horde seem as traumatized by [[Siege of Blackrock Spire|this battle]] as the [[Sons of Lothar]]. They remain here and fight a war long lost.}}

After 6 banners are burnt, go to [[Eitrigg]] and turn in three quests.
:{{Text|Say|Eitrigg|The Horde left behind this dark past long ago. If only everyone here had come with us.}}
