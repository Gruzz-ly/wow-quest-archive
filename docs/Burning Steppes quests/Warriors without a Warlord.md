==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Warlord Grazla.jpg|Warlord Grazla|Warlord Grazla has commanded the Dark Horde long enough.}}
Enter Blackrock Stronghold and take out the leader of the Dark Horde.
*Defeat the [[Warlord Grazla|Dark Horde Leader]]
*[[Grazla's Relic Fragment|Relic Fragment]] recovered

==Description==
Fighting directly isn't the only way. Despite our work in the area, this Dark Horde hasn't quit or even diminished. They must have a charismatic leader in [[Blackrock Stronghold]], telling them not to worry--that victory for their Horde is near.

Take out their leader. Once we do. I suspect this Dark Horde will come to nothing, with much less bloodshed.

And Faol thinks there may be a fragment of the relic he's looking for. Recover that as well!

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Dark Horde Circle]]
* [[Dark Horde Cowl]]
* [[Dark Horde Helm]]
* [[Dark Horde Helmet]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the leader of the Dark Horde?

==Completion==
Excellent, <name>! I believe this will save many lives across the region. The Dark Horde will fall apart quickly with no warlord to rally around.

==Notes==
Make sure you accept [[A True Horde of Dark Horde]] as well.

[[Arator the Redeemer]] shall accompany you. 

Go into Blackrock Stronghold.
:{{Text|Yell|Warlord Grazla|I'm told that [[Mar'kag]] is just a stinking corpse.}}

Confront Warlord Grazla.
:{{Text|Say|Warlord Grazla|Fall before the might of the Dark Horde!}}

;Upon slaying her
:{{Text|Say|Warlord Grazla|The Dark Horde shall never be stopped.}}

;Upon looting [[Grazla's Relic Fragment]]
:{{Text|Say|Arator|The final fragment. It's of a shield. And I think I know whose it was.}}

Head to Danath Trollbane and turn in both quests.
