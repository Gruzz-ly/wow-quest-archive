== Objectives ==
While using the [[Blackrock Disguise]], deliver the Clear Glass Orb to {{NPC||High Warlock Xi'lun}} atop [[Dreadmaul Rock]] in [[Burning Steppes]].
*[[Clear Glass Orb]] (provided)

== Description ==
Intel tells us that High Warlock Xi'lun - the final member of the Big Three - is within the cave atop Dreadmaul Peak, preparing for his big moment.

He is waiting for a delivery: an [[Orb of Domination]], with which he can perform a powerful summoning ritual. I want you to give him this:

<Troteman hands you a glass orb.>

This is the clear glass orb that you freed from the [[Altar of Storms (Burning Steppes)|Altar of Storms]]. It is powerless. Give it to Xi'lun, and cross your fingers that he doesn't notice.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

== Progress ==
I don't have time for games, fool. Get out of my sight.

== Completion ==
Pff! You're late! DO you know how long I've been waiting for [[Ner'gosh the Shadow|Ner'gosh]] to deliver this orb?

<Xi'lun looks down at the orb, then up at you.>

There's something strange about this orb... it's too...

<Xi'lun trails off.>

Never mind, it must be my nerves talking. Thank you for the delivery. For blood and honor!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Delivery for Thorg'izog]] and [[A Delivery for Neeralak]] before heading out.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Colonel Troteman|Don't forget that disguise!}}
Put on the costume and mount up. Get to the top of the outside of Dreadmaul Rock. Xi'lun awaits inside the cave on top.

On complete:
:{{text|say|High Warlock Xi'lun|You know, I'm going to be using this orb to perform a powerful ritual in just a few minutes. Don't tell anyone this... but I'll be summoning a [[pit lord]]. Redridge will bow to the Blackrock!}}
After completing all three, Troteman radios in with [[Locked and Loaded]].
