== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Oralius}} at [[Morgan's Vigil]] in [[Burning Steppes]].

== Description ==
Our work here in [[Chiselgrip]] is done, mostly thanks to you.  We'll now be moving on to the east, to Morgan's Vigil.

Our intel indicates that Morgan's Vigil has been vacated, as most of its inhabitants have moved into [[Blackrock Mountain]] to fight their own battle against the [[Blackrock clan|Blackrocks]].  It should serve as a sufficient base of operations for the final stages of our plan.

Of course, {{NPC||John J. Keeshan||Keeshan}} will be joining you on the road.  As will {{NPC||Colonel Troteman||I}}.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||40}}

== Completion ==
You've arrived! And just in time for the friendship ceremony!

<Oralius looks wistfully over his shoulder at the ogre head, and quickly becomes panicked.>

Captain Winky! Where'd Captain Winky go?

No, don't tell me he got cold feet!

== Notes ==
On accept, Troteman and Keeshan join the player's party. Mount up and follow the road southeast to reach Morgan's Vigil. Oralius is now inside the burned-out building on the south side of the vigil. Don't forget the flight path!

On complete, Troteman and Keeshan head off to the building to the east.
