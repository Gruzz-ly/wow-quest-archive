==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Nagosh the Scarred.jpg|Nagosh the Scarred|Nagosh charges his enemies fiercely and fearlessly. While his strategy is not safe, it is quite effective.}}
Defeat Nagosh the Scarred.
*[[Nagosh the Scarred]] slain
*[[Nagosh' Relic Fragment|Relic Fragment]] recovered

==Description==
The [[Dark Horde]] may strut around inside the mountain, but an orc called Nagosh is who rules this roost.

He just barks orders, then charges straight into a fight. Commanders like that are what get everyone on all sides killed. The Dark Horde must like bad tactics. They promoted this rock-head.

I'd bet anything that this loud bully claimed [[Alonsus Faol|Faol]]'s shiny relic. Keep an eye out. He may jump you in the middle of a fight.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Scarred Blackrock Choker]]
* [[Medallion of the Dark Horde]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 15,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did ye put a stop to Nagosh?

==Completion==
Did ya get Faol's relic?

I hope that old priest knows what he's doing.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting [[Due Recognition]], '''Nagosh the Scarred''', & [[Disarm the Dark Horde]]
:{{Text|Say|Kurdran Wildhammer|The orcs in the mountain don't just have a fragment, they're also stockpiling weapons.}}
:{{Text|Say|Kurdran Wildhammer|Seems like a good chance tae smash things up, if ye ask me. Let me know if ye want me tae join in the fun.}}
:''Kurdran Wildhammer flew into the Blackrock Mountains.''

[[Arator the Redeemer]] shall accompany you. Go into Blackrock Mountains and confront Nagosh.
:{{Text|Say|Nagosh the Scarred|Bold mistake to challenge me here.}}

;Upon slaying him
:{{Text|Say|Nagosh the Scarred|What's one more... scar?}}

;Upon looting [[Nagosh' Relic Fragment]]
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Looks like a piece of an old shield.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|Odd for him to be lugging that around.}}

Head to the Blackrock Mountains and meet up with Kurdran.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|Say|Arator|This whole expedition has something to do with [[Turalyon|my father]], doesn't it?}}
