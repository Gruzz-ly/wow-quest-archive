==Objectives==
Meet with [[Vindicator Boros]] in front of [[First to Your Aid]] in [[Dalaran]].

==Description==
I've obtained a request from Vindicator Boros in Dalaran asking for our help.

He has recovered a soldier who escaped from the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]! He was injured and his wounds are resisting every healing treatment available to them. Normally this would fall to an acolyte to handle, but the soldier mentioned [[T'uure, Beacon of the Naaru|T'uure]] in his delirium! I thought the holy gem was lost!

You are strong with the [[Light]], perhaps you can succeed where they can't?

If you need it, [[Brother Larry]] can provide you with a flight to Dalaran.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}} (level 100)
*1,500 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Completion==
Thank you for arriving in such haste, <Brother/Sister>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brother Larry|If you need a ride to Dalaran, my bats are at the ready.}}

Approaching Boros in Dalaran:
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|A priest! Thank the Light!}}
