==Objectives==
Meet [[Kalecgos|Kalec]] at the [[Violet Citadel]] in [[Dalaran]].

==Description==
[[:Light's Wrath]]... a bold choice. Though if you believe you can control its energies, it could prove vital to our cause.

Retrieving it won't be easy. It was last held by the [[Kirin Tor]], who, fearing its unbridled power, handed it to the [[blue dragonflight]] to secure away from the hands of men. Only they would know exactly where it was taken, or how to retrieve it.

The dragon Kalec may be our best chance. He now resides upon the [[Council of Six]] in Dalaran. Seek him, and your answers, there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}
*1,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So you seek Light's Wrath? A dangerous weapon, to be sure.

Long ago the Kirin Tor entrusted its safekeeping to the blue dragonflight. It was locked away in the only place that could contain its rampant power  - the [[Nexus Vault]].

I have not been there in some time, however. After the blue dragonflight was dissolved, the Nexus was abandoned. There is no knowing whether the Nexus Vault is still intact - or what may be waiting in the Nexus itself.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Brother Larry]] at the western part of [[Faol's Rest]] to quickly return to Dalaran.
