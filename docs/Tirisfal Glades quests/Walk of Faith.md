==Objectives==
Protect Calia inside her shield and collect the pure plague sample.
*Speak to [[Calia Menethil|Calia]] to Begin
*Collect Pure Plague Sample
*Escape the Blight with Calia
*Return to Lilian Voss outside of [[Brill]].

==Description==
I promised that I would help, and I shall. We need that pure sample of [[New Plague|the plague]] afflicting [[Ruins of Lordaeron|Lordaeron]], but we cannot put anyone else at risk.

Come with me. I will call forth a shield of [[Light|Holy Light]] to safeguard us deep into the blighted area so that we can collect that sample.

This spell will require my full focus. I'll trust you to protect us from anything that might try to stop us.

Are you with me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
I guess I should have faith.

==Completion==
That's something you don't see every day.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Calia
:<Calia stares out across the field of plague. Her hands tremble slightly.>

:{{gossip|Let's get that plague sample.}}
:''Calia conjures a spherical shield of Light and walks into the blight, and the player has the Weight of Responsibility debuff and Shielded buff..''
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|Stay close and be wary. I can't hold back the effects of the blight for long, and we don't know what threats are lurking out there.}}
:''[[Blighted Soldier]]s attack as Calia and the adventurer walk into the cloud of blight.
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|The toxicity is... overwhelming.}}
:''A [[Blighted Lieutenant]] attacks out of the blight.''
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|This should be far enough. Hurry, get the sample!}}
:''The Collect Pure Sample extra action button appears.''
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|That's it! We need to get back. My shield is starting to fail.}}
:''The shield shrinks as Calia walks back to safety, as [[Blighted Soldier]]s attack.''
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|Keep fighting! We're almost there!}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Well I'll be.}}
:{{text|say|Deathstalker Commander Belmont|She... did it. And survived.}}

;On completion
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|We have the blight sample. Now to bring it to the plague-lords of [[Maldraxxus]].}}
:{{text|say|Dark Ranger Velonara|I hope you're right about their expertise, Lady Menethil. This could give us a fighting chance to restore the city.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|I'll accompany Calia along with our friend here. Faranell, we'll need to bring [[Plague Eater|your last plague eater]] with us, too.}}
:{{text|say|Master Apothecary Faranell|Do be careful with it! Should these plague-lords bolster its resilience, the Apothecaries can replicate it many times over.}}

==Progression==
{{Return to Lordaeron}}
