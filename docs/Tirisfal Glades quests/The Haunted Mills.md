==Objectives==
Bring Dargol's Skull to [[Coleman Farthing]] at the [[Agamand Mills]].
*[[Dargol's Skull]] (provided)

==Description==
You sense a malign presence coming from within the skull of the beast.  Coleman Farthing may be interested in seeing this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|10}}
*780 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity]]

==Progress==
Well well... what do we have here? 

==Completion==
Is this Dargol?  He was vicious even in life, with a temper that bit deep and a blade that bit deeper.

Undeath has not done him any favors, though it suits his personality.

<Coleman holds the skull up and peers into the empty eye sockets.>

Yes, this was certainly Dargol.  I can sense his malice, even from the remains you've fetched.

You have my thanks, <name>.
