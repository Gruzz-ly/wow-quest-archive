==Objectives==
Speak to [[Deathstalker Commander Belmont]] at the southern wall.
*Speak to Belmont

==Description==
Just when we get our feet back under ourselves, someone wants to knock us down again.

There are people who still think that we don't deserve this home, and they're willing to kill us to get what they want.

And some old grudges never go away. Somehow, the [[Scarlet Crusade]], or what remains of it, has gotten a toehold on [[Fenris Isle]].

Go to the southern wall of the [[Ruins of Lordaeron]]. Deathstalker Commander Belmont has got eyes on them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This is why we can never let down our guard.

==Completion==
I didn't expect the Scarlets to have so many soldiers they could muster for an attack like this.

If I wasn't so mad I'd be impressed. Fortunately when I get mad, I get stabby.

Still, this is bad, <name>. This isn't just some random rabble of farmers. Someone must be calling the shots and they know what they're doing.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Commander Belmont has eyes on the enemy at the southern wall. We'll meet there and get you briefed.}}

In the southern part of the city, [[Forsaken Deathguard (heritage)|Forsaken Deathguards]] and [[Forsaken Catapult (heritage)|Forsaken Catapults]] are present. On the ramparts, these troops are supported by [[Dark Ranger (heritage)|Dark Rangers]], [[Forsaken Dreadmage (heritage)|Forsaken Dreadmages]], and [[Forsaken Soldier (heritage)|Forsaken Soldiers]]. The catapults are firing at levitating [[Scarlet Archmage (heritage)|Scarlet Archmages]].

Near Belmont is Lilian Voss kneeling beside the wounded [[Lee Scolio]] and a burning [[Scarlet Banner]].

;Lilian's gossip
:We can never stop defending ourselves. The moment we stop is the moment they strike.

:{{Gossip|What happened?}}
::It's the Scarlet Crusade.

::They must have thought they could sneak attack us, and they were partially right. They've gotten a foothold on Fenris Isle, but we still hold the ruins.

::We've lost some of our own, and we can't afford to lose more. We're going to have to be smart about this.

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}

;Lee's gossip
:Ow.

:{{Gossip|What happened to you?}}

::I thought I would be a hero and infiltrate the island, take out a few Scarlet Crusade.

::But there were too many of them. I barely made it out.

::This isn't fair, I haven't felt pain like this since I was alive.

::{{Gossip|What does it feel like?}}
:::Like an infestation of electrified [[spider]]s. Which has only happened to me once, but I know exactly how it feels.

:::... Yeah it feels like that. Except the spiders are pink.

:::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}

Speak with Belmont:
:We can't turn our back on our enemies for a single moment. Or else they'll put a dagger in us.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Show me what's going on.}}
:A cutscene plays out where the Forsaken army is engaged in combat with the Scarlet Crusade on the [[Dawning Isles]], but the crusaders overwhelm them and kill them.
:{{Text|say|Deathstalker Commander Belmont|This? This is a problem. The Scarlet Crusade has overrun parts of Silverpine Forest and made a base on Fenris Isle. We don't have the numbers to dislodge them outright.}}
:{{Text|say|Deathstalker Commander Belmont|But we have to drive them out of our lands, and protect our home. There is no other option. We fight.}}

:{{Gossip|Wasn't the Scarlet Crusade already defeated?}}
::Many times. In the [[Plaguelands]], in [[Northrend]]. Some of them gave up and joined less fanatical orders, but it seems like there's always some old leader or new opportunist willing to take up the accursed banner.

::There's people in the world with good reason to hate the [[Forsaken]]. But the Scarlet Crusade isn't here for that. We are the living dead, and they think we are just abominations meant to be destroyed.

::For some, that's all they need for killer hatred.

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
