==Objectives==
Kill 10 {{NPC||Tirisfal Farmer}}s or {{NPC||Tirisfal Farmhand}}s.
* Tirisfal Farmer slain (10)

==Description==
[[Human]]s are notoriously fickle creatures. The [[farmer]]s to the west are no exception. Sure, they may be plowing their fields peacefully now, but tomorrow, they may be raising their scythes against us. The [[Alliance]] looms close by in [[Ruins of Gilneas|Gilneas]], and the power of [[Stormwind (kingdom)|Stormwind]] looms to the south... any of these could recruit these tillers and use them as a wedge against us.

I want them dead. See to it that it's done.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Simmer's Bracers
|Scythe Blade
|Simmer's Dirk
|Simmer's Cudgel
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
You've not completed my task, <name>. It is time for the harvesters to become the harvested!

==Completion==
You've makings of a mighty <class>, <race>. I heard the cries of those humans from all the way over here. Perhaps soon we will be rid of this human blight.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fields of Grief]] before heading out. Also, {{NPC||Sedrick Calston}} offers [[Ever So Lonely]] upstairs.

Exit the estate and head west-northwest to reach the farmstead, then go killing and looting. After that, head to the north to reach the beach and capture a murloc by wounding one down to below 50% health and using the leash on it. Then head back to the estate.
