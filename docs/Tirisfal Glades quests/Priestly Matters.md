{{text|say|[[Hooded Priestess]]|Master <name>, if I could get your attention for a moment!}}

==Objectives==
Attend the secret meeting at [[Faol's Rest]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].
* (Optional) Take the Portal to the [[Dalaran Crater]]
* Meet with [[Calia Menethil|the priest]] at Faol's Rest
* Listen to [[Alonsus Faol]]

==Description==
Master <name>, I come at the behest of one who seeks to organize a stronger resistance to the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] threat.

If you would meet him at Faol's Rest in Tirisfal Glades, he will guarantee both your safety and an opportunity to play a pivotal role in the conflict.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|70}}
*7,550 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Can I take that as a yes?

If you are ready, I'd like to get started immediately.

I know you are immensely capable, but let's not leave anything to chance!

==Notes==
On accept {{Sl-inline}}:
:{{Text|say|Hooded Priestess|Excellent, Faol wants you to have this hearthstone. It should get you to his meeting place.}}
:''The player receives [[Faol's Hearthstone]].''
:''The Hooded Priestess bows and then despawns.''

On accept prior ''Shadowlands'':
:{{text|say|Hooded Priestess|Excellent, you can take the portal to Dalaran Crater and just fly north. He will be expecting you soon!}}
:''The Hooded Priestess bows and then despawns.''

The portal to the Dalaran Crater is found in the [[Portrait Room]], which is accessed through a teleporter in the middle of the [[Chamber of the Guardian]]. You will be dropped in mid-air, so remember to use [[Levitate]] before you hit the ground. Note that if you are a [[Horde]] priest, it is quicker to take the portal to the [[Undercity]] from [[Windrunner's Sanctuary]] than it is to use the Dalaran Crater portal.

Once you arrive at Faol's Rest, speak with [[Calia Menethil|Calia]].

:Hello there! You were not followed, were you?
:{{gossip|Are you the one I'm supposed to meet? Why all the way out here?}}

[[Alonsus Faol]] appears behind one of the stone arches and walks into the central area.
:{{text|say|Alonsus Faol|Forgive the secrecy... old habits die hard. I am Alonsus Faol. At times I have been a leader of [[Church of the Holy Light|a church]], a mindless minion of the [[Scourge]], and a commander in a secret war. But I have always been a priest first.}}
:{{text|say|Alonsus Faol|The Legion poses a threat that cannot be ignored. So I have decided to step out from the shadows. I believe we must unite priesthoods of all denominations against our common enemy.}}
:''Alonsus pauses in front of the altar and statue in the western corner.''
:{{text|say|Alonsus Faol|To lead this effort, we require a priest who is a proven champion to all people. I believe you are that hero, <name>, but others must be convinced. Will you accept this challenge?}}

==Progression==
