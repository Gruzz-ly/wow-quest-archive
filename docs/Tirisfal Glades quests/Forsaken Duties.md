==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Deathguard Linnea}} at [[Death's Watch Waystation]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Description==
I need a fresh report from our [[Deathguard]] waystation to the east.

I must know if more [[Scourge]] forces have slipped past [[Bulwark|The Bulwark]] and into Tirisfal. Our vigilance on the border to the [[Plaguelands]] must be maintained - we can't let the Scourge get a stronger foothold here!

Travel south along the road, then east at the fork to the waystation. Speak with Deathguard Linnea. She has the information I need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||15}}
* 30 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
Magistrate Sevren wants a report? Very well: the defenders at The Bulwark are holding the majority of the Scourge at bay, but some do slip through on occasion.

We have seen sporadic Scourge activity east of this station, with a concentration around the [[Balnir Farmstead]].

==Notes==
Exit Brill to the southeast and keep heading that direction to reach the waystation.

{{NPC||Gretchen Dedmar}} offers the next quest, [[The Chill of Death]].

==Progression==
{{The New Forsaken}}
