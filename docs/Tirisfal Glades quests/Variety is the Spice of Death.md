==Objectives==
Obtain 4 Marrowpetals, 4 Xavren's Thorns, and 8 Briny Sea Cucumbers.
* [[Marrowpetal]] (4)
* [[Xavren's Thorn]] (4)
* [[Briny Sea Cucumber (item)]] (8)

==Description==
These pumpkins have a purpose, <class>. They'll be the delivery mechanism for my latest batch of plague, which should be a particularly painful and virulent concoction. However, the plague requires a few rare ingredients.

We'll need Marrowpetals, which grow at the bottom of [[Stillwater Pond|Stillwater]] lake, just to the east of here. We'll also need Xavren's thorn, which grows on rocky cliffs to the northwest. Finally, we need some briny sea cucumbers, found in the surf off of [[Whispering Shore]].

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Xavren's Gloves
|Xavren's Gauntlets
|Marrowpetal Boots
}}

{{Itembox|You will also receive: 
|Pumpkin Bag (common)}}

* {{cost||1|25}}
* 410 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
I've got a feeling this will be my best batch yet, good <class>.

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. Now comes the fun part.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Scarlet Palisade]] before heading out.

Exit the mansion and turn around to run east. Jump into [[Stillwater Pond]] and collect Marrowpetal Stalks. Jump out and take the road back to the west north of the farmstead and turn north to get to the [[Whispering Shore]]. Before heading down to the shore itself, take a right and stick to the cliffs to loot Xavern's Thorn. Then, jump down to the shoreline and head into the water. The cucumber are friendly critters moving about.

Once done, kill Scarlets at the Palisade and pick up [[A Scarlet Letter]] before heading back to the estate.
