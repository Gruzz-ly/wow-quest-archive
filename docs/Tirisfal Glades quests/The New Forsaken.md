==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Magistrate Sevren}} at [[Brill]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Description==
Speaking frankly, the [[Forsaken]] of yesteryear were a sniveling, pathetic group. We huddled together in decrepit old human buildings, hiding from the [[Scourge]], cowering from the [[Alliance]], and groveling at the foot of the [[Horde]].

Look before you now, and see the product of the new Forsaken. We have made our mark here on [[Azeroth]], and that mark will grow. Our dominion will soon blanket the world!

You want my advice? Speak with Magistrate Sevren in Brill, down this road. He runs that town.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||17}}
*65 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
Yes, I'm Brill's local magistrate, reporting directly to the {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Dark Lady}}. Impress me, and you may end up meeting the Banshee Queen herself. Now, onto your first task...

==Notes==
On the path to Brill after collecting the three [[Gloom Weed]] for [[Gordo's Task]], players come across {{NPC||Deathguard Dillinger}} at [[Cold Hearth Manor]] offering this quest and [[A Putrid Task]]. Complete A Putrid Task then keep heading toward Brill. Make sure to pick up the flight path and talk to the innkeeper!

Sveren can be found upstairs behind the innkeeper.
