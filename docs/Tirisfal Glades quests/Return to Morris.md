==Objectives==
Buy a bat ride to [[Brill]] from the bat master {{NPC||Michael Garrett}}, then bring Gordon's Crate to {{NPC||Deathguard Morris}} in [[Brill]].
* [[Gordon's Crate]] (provided)

==Description==
The bat master in Brill is [[Bat Handler Anette]]. If you have already met her, then I can give you a bat to fly back to her.

Our bats will always fly to the [[Undercity]], but to travel to more remote locales their rider must first visit the area and speak with its bat master.

You have met Anette in Brill, so you may now fly bats there. Speak with me again when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
*1050 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
<Name>, you return. Do you have our supplies from the Undercity?

==Completion==
Good work, <name>. These weapons will ensure our [[Deathguard]]s don't get caught unprepared.

You have done a valuable service for our {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Dark Lady}}.

==Progression==
{{Supplying Brill}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Renamed from "[[Return to Podrig]]", updated for Cataclysm.}}
