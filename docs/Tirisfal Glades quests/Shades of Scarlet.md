[[File:Shades of Scarlet.jpg|thumb|The shade of [[Dathrohan]] and a group of [[Mad Shade]]s]]

==Objectives==
Search for leads amongst the [[shade]]s at the [[Scarlet Monastery]].
*Search for leads along the path
*[[Fearful Crusader]] confronted {{co|81.3|39.6|Tirisfal Glades}}
*Search for leads along the path
*[[Dathrohan]] confronted {{co|82.5|36.4|Tirisfal Glades}}
*Search for leads along the path
*[[Suzannah]] confronted {{co|82.7|33.8|Tirisfal Glades}}

==Description==
I need your help, <name>. I thought I had achieved some semblance of peace--although my sins might not be forgiven, I could at least reunite with the spirits of my beloved family. Yet... [[Suzannah Thomson|my wife]]'s [[Ghost|spirit]]. It is as though she never existed.

[[Hallow's End]] draws the shades that haunt the Monastery out from the shadows. Trapped in the past, they walk the grounds repeating their nightmares.

With any luck, one of them might give us answers as to what happened to her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*3x [[Tricky Treat]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
<Sir Thomas is lost in thought, and jumps at your approach.>

<Name>! My apologies for running off back there. There are... some memories I wish never to revisit. 

It would seem these cruel shades know just how to salt our wounds.

Come, I think I know where to look next.

==Notes==
On accept, Sir Thomas follows along and will participate in combat:
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|Let's press on <name>. Be on your guard.}}

Up ahead are [[Terrified Shade]] civilians and [[Mad Shade]]s of Scarlet Crusaders. First group:
:{{Text|say|Terrified Shade|They're going to help us, right?}}
:{{Text|say|Terrified Shade|We're all gonna die...}}

Second group:
:{{Text|say|Terrified Shade|Please! There are children with us!}}
:{{Text|say|Mad Shade|I said clear the road!}}

Third group:
:{{Text|say|Mad Shade|What should we do with them, sir?}}
:{{Text|say|Mad Shade|Bring them to the watchtower, then kill them. Burn the bodies.}}
:{{Text|say|Mad Shade|Yes, sir.}}

Approach the Fearful Crusader:
:{{Text|say|Fearful Crusader|No, stay away! The infected... they're everywhere!}}
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|Even the haunting shades remember the fear. Let us put it to rest.}}

Interact with him:
:{{Text|say|Fearful Crusader|GET BACK!}}
:''The [[Shade of Fear]] appears.''

Defeat the shade:
:{{Text|say|Fearful Crusader|The Light... fades away...}}
:''The Fearful Crusader fades from existence.''
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|May you find peace, friend.}}
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|Did you notice the strange aura that shade had? It felt... sinister.}}

Continue toward the Monastery, toward the ghost of [[Dathrohan]] and a group of Mad Shades:
:{{Text|say|Dathrohan|Let this be a lesson! Any who fraternize with the Scourge are to be shown no mercy!}}
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|Grand Crusader Dathrohan!?}}
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|No, another shade formed of nightmare. Send it to the nether.}}

Interact with him:
:{{Text|say|Dathrohan|A Scourge conspirator! Into the ground with you!}}
:''The [[Shade of Deception]] appears.''

Defeat this shade too:
:{{Text|say|Dathrohan|Ah, Thomas... so weak... so malleable...}}
:''Dathrohan fades from existence.''
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|We followed the Grand Crusader without question... if we were to survive, his orders were absolute.}}
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|How could I not see what he truly was? Perhaps I did not want to see.}}

Continue toward the entrance where a projection of [[Suzannah]] appears:
:{{Text|say|Suzannah|Thomas... Come back to me, Thomas.}}
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|You! How DARE you besmirch the memory of my wife!}}

Interact with her:
:{{Text|say|Suzannah|How could you turn on us!}}
:''The [[Shade of Guilt]] appears.''

Defeat it:
:{{Text|say|Suzannah|Murderer...}}
:''Suzannah fades away.''
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|I--}}
:{{Text|emote|Thomas' eyes go wide with shock.}}
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|I didn't know... I couldn't have known!}}
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|This shouldn't be possible. How could they...?}}
