==Objectives==
Kill Rot Hide Graverobbers and Rot Hide Mongrels, and obtain 6 flasks of Embalming Ichor.
* [[Rot Hide Graverobber]] slain (8)
* [[Rot Hide Mongrel]] slain (5)
* [[Embalming Ichor]] (6)

==Description==
The [[Mass Grave|mass graves]] within the forest to the west of us were made to accommodate the... impressive... number of deaths [[Tirisfal Glades|Tirisfal]] suffered when the [[Plague of Undeath|Plague]] first came.

The bodies in these graves have so far been spared an undeath, but the [[Scourge]] now send [[Rot Hide]] [[gnoll]]s to gather the corpses and use them to bolster their armies. This cannot be allowed!

Your task is twofold: slay the [[Rot Hide]]s at the mass grave and [[Garren's Haunt]], and gather from them the embalming ichor that gives them life.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cold Steel Gauntlets
|Zombie Skin Boots}}
You will also receive: {{cost||1|75}}

==Progress==
Is your task complete?  Have you destroyed those dog-things and drained them of their ichor?

==Completion==
Expertly done, <name>. The Scourge are mistaken if they think they can use those corpses against us, and the fluid you gathered from the Rot Hide slaves will be studied by my master. It may have secrets we can use against them.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Doom Weed (quest)]] before heading out.

==Progression==
{{Garren's Haunt}}
