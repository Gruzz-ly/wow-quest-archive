==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||High Executor Derrington}} at the [[Bulwark]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Description==
You've done much for us here, <name>, but <men/women> of your caliber are needed elsewhere.

To the east lies the Bulwark: a fortified barricade against the ravages of the [[Plaguelands]]. The Bulwark protects us from [[Scourge]] invasions, and has allowed us enough sanctity to build up our forces here in Tirisfal Glades.

Go, speak with High Executor Derrington. He is an ally, and will doubtless appreciate whatever aid you can give him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||70}}
* 80 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
<The High Executor sizes you up.>

Not much of a <class>, are you? Well, you will be when I'm done with you.

==Notes==
Southeast out of Brill, then east along the main road to the Bulwark. Make sure to pick up the flight path!

==Progression==
{{Garren's Haunt}}

==Trivia==
The name of this quest is a reference to ''Diablo II'', wherein Marius mentions his travels with the Dark Wanderer and the fact that they always traveled in an eastward direction.
