==Objectives==
Escape to the Darkwalk.
*Escape to the [[Darkwalk]]

==Description==
I do not enjoy seeing others forged by [[Tyr]] disabled. They went through such effort to keep [[Tomb of Tyr|the tomb]] collapsing, and now it will languish devoid of even what was left of Tyr's light.

<Koranos gestures to the [[:Silver Scale]].>

I hope whatever is in the scale is worth their destruction. Let us find another console to see what, if anything, is on the scale.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
We act in the service of Tyr. He would understand.

==Completion==
We are safe for now, but we should not linger.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Travard|Hmm...}}
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|Is something wrong, Travard?}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|This place fills me with dread. This is where [[Tyr's Guard]] fell.}}

:{{Text|say|Travard|Whatever you need to do, do it quickly. I've lost friends to the monsters that lurk here in the shadows.}}
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|We need to check the memory before we return. <Name>, speak to me when you are ready.}}

Travard has new gossip:
{{book|content=The monster that attacked Tyr's Guard may still be lurking. We must stay vigilant for as long as we remain here.}}
