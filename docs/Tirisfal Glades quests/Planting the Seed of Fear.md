==Objectives==
Chase 12 Vilefin Tadpoles until they pass out in fear.
* [[Vile Fin Tadpole]]s frightened (12)

==Description==
It seems that {{NPC||Apothecary Jerrod||Jerrod}} has you hunting the [[murloc]]s to the north. That's good... we can use their parts for our poisons. I get a little worried sometimes, though...

The [[Vile Fin|Vilefin]] spawning grounds are not far off [[Tirisfal Glades|Tirisfal]]'s northern coast, so you'll probably notice several tadpoles among the adults on the shore. If these impressionable young murlocs were to seek revenge against us... that could ruin us. Go chase them, and show them that the [[Forsaken]] and the [[Horde]] are not to be trifled with.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
* 525 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Chase them until they pass out in fear, <name>. Let them grow up in fear of the Forsaken.

==Completion==
Did they run from you, <name>? Good. This is better than killing them... if they live to tell the tale, then future generations of murlocs will learn to fear us.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Off the Scales]] before heading out. On the beach, find a camp full of tadpoles and chase them around for a few seconds until they pass out.
