==Objectives==
Meet [[Dark Ranger Velonara]] in the [[Sepulcher]] in [[Silverpine Forest]].
*Speak to [[Forsaken Dreadmage (heritage)|Forsaken Dreadmage]]

==Description==
[[Faranell]] and Velonara already went to the Sepulcher to work on a piece of our plan.

We can hold the wall for now with just a few [[deathguard]]s and [[dark ranger]]s, but we need someone who can hit the [[Scarlet Crusade|Scarlets]] where they are. Preferably without losing more of our own.

Go to the Sepulcher and meet with Velonara. You are the sharpened tip of our poisoned blade.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good, you've arrived in one piece. Master Apothecary Faranell and I have pondered on a few ideas for how we can take out those Scarlets.

But first, we need to watch our backs out here. And I think Faranell is cooking up something rather explosive.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Deathstalker Commander Belmont|I will prepare our main forces.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|And I will collect [[Calia]] and the [[banshee]]s for support. We will meet you at the Sepulcher soon.}}
:{{Text|say|Forsaken Dreadmage|Got a port for you here, <name>.}}

Speak to the Dreadmage:
:Yes?

:{{Gossip|quest=|Send me to the Sepulcher in Silverpine Forest.}}
:''The adventurer is teleported to the crypt of the Sepulcher.''
:{{Text|say|[[Andrew Hilbert]]|Welcome back to Silverpine. Did you get yourself some fresh embalming fluid? You look strong.}}

The Sepulcher is reinforced by Dreadguards, Apothecaries, Dark Rangers, and [[Plague Wagon (heritage)|Plague Wagons]]. Approach Velonara and Faranell outside:
:{{Text|say|Dark Ranger Velonara|Are you certain this is necessary, Master Apothecary? Even our allies are fearful of our use of these mixtures.}}
:{{Text|say|Master Apothecary Faranell|It is very necessary, my dear! This recipe spreads best by detonation. And, well, it's just fun.}}

;Faranell's gossip
:Ah, Silverpine. Though I think it could be more appropriately named "Blightpine" or "Silverblight." What do you think? Could it catch on?

;Velonara's gossip
:Our quivers are full and we are ready.

:{{Gossip|What's the plan?}}
::The plan is to get you behind enemy lines, while we strategically prepare the bulk of our forces. You can do damage right under their twitching noses and we will have our soldiers ready for the right moment.

::Faranell has an idea of how we can use a particular blend of plague that will disrupt the Scarlet Crusade, with minimal risk to ourselves.

::That is, assuming he gets his formula right. Which he usually does.

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
