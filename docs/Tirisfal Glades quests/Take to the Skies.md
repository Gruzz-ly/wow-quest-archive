==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Executor Zygand}} at [[Brill]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Description==
If you're headed back to Brill, you'll want to stop by Executuor Zygand on your way out. I hear there's some excitement going on in [[Silverpine Forest]], to the south. He'll know more than I do.

Speak with me again when you're ready to head out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2|50}}
* 625 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
Welcome back, <name>. I've heard stories from the east. Who would have thought that a young <race> <class> like you would have been the one to wipe out the last whimpering remnants of the [[Scarlet Crusade]]?

==Notes==
Speak to Timothy again:
:{{gossip|I'll take that flight to Brill now.}}
