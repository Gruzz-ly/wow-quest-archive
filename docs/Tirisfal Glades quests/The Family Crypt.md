==Objectives==
Kill 5 Wailing Ancestors and 5 Rotting Ancestors.
* [[Wailing Ancestor]] slain (5)
* [[Rotting Ancestor]] slain (5)

==Description==
The strongest point in the mills is the [[Agamand Family Crypt]]. With necromancy, {{NPC||Captain Dargol}} has raised the ancestors of the [[Agamand]]s and plans to use them against us.

This cannot pass, and you must stop it. Travel to the Agamand Family Crypt and defeat the raised Agamand ancestors.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Agamand Family Leggings
|Agamand Family Bracelet

|Agamand Family Bracer
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Time is not a luxury we have, <name>. With each passing hour, the [[Scourge]]'s hold on [[Tirisfal Glades]] grows more firm.

==Completion==
Your actions struck a telling blow against the Scourge. And your victory will not go unnoticed - not by the Forsaken, nor by our enemies.

Continue the struggle as we all do, <name>, and one day the Forsaken will have the dominion over [[Azeroth]] that they are owed!
