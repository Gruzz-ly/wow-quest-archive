==Objectives==
Use the Murloc Leash on a Vile Fin murloc at the [[Whispering Shore]], then return it to {{NPC||Sedrick Calston}} at [[Calston Estate]].
* Vile Fin captured
* Vile Fin returned
* [[Murloc Leash]] (provided)

==Description==
You work hard your whole life, and what do you get? Killed by a [[Plague of Undeath|plague]]. Then you work even harder in undeath, and what do you get? Money, yes, and a small estate with a few pesky hangers-on, but happiness? Not so much.

I'm lonely in my old age, <name>. I need a companion. Use this leash on one of the murlocs at the Whispering Shore to the northwest. You'll have to weaken it first before it can be leashed. Then bring it back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1}}
* 410 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Oh, the pain of loneliness is too much to bear!

==Completion==
Oh, look at him! Isn't he the most adorable thing you've ever seen? Thank you, <name>. I feel more energetic already.

==Notes==
Sedrick can be found upstairs in the Calston Estate.

Exit the estate and head west-northwest to reach the farmstead, then go killing and looting. After that, head to the north to reach the beach and capture a murloc by wounding one down to below 50% health and using the leash on it.
:{{Text|emote|The <name> is ready to be captured!}}

Then head back to the estate.

On completion, {{NPC||Sparky}} spawns in Sedrick's room.
