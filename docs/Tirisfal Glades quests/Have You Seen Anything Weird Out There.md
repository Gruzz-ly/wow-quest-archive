==Objectives==
Speak with [[Executor Zygand]] about your encounter with the [[worgen]].

==Description==
<Race>! Listen up, I got somethin'... odd to discuss.

I was out fishin' by [[Brightwater Lake]] when I saw the darnedest thing... some sorta wolf-man, running around Tirisfal.  Ya don't suppose that could be a... worgen, do ya?

Anyway, I keep tellin' myself I should tell Executor Zygand about it, but I just get so scared when I talk to that guy.  Maybe you could talk with him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|85}} (or {{coppercost|180}} at max level)
*315 XP (or {{coppercost|180}} at max level)
*+75 reputation with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
Hmm... yes, that makes sense.  Since the worgen have come streaming out of Gilneas, I knew it would only be a matter of time before they arrived here in Tirisfal.

==Patch changes==
