==Objectives==
Recover the rune from [[Night Web's Hollow]] and use it to learn a new ability, then return to [[Maximillion]] in [[Deathknell]].
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Haunt (warlock rune)]]

==Description==
I've been experimenting with a new type of [[magic]] - a rune which can channel [[fel]] energies to fuel powerful spells. I sent an apprentice to test the rune against the [[spider]]s in the mine to the north, but he has not returned. I suspect we will not see him again.

Perhaps you will prove more resilient. Go to the mine and recover the rune from the spiders' webs. Learn its magic, and report back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
*[[Tattered Cloth Gloves]]

==Progress==
What have you found, <name>?

==Completion==
You seem to have taken well to this new magic, <name>. Find more runes like this and engrave them to your equipment to wield new abilities against those who would oppose you.

Someday, perhaps your power will even eclipse my own.
