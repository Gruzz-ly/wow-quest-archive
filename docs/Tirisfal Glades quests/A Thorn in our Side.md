==Objectives==
Kill 3 Scarlet Zealots and 3 Scarlet Missionaries, and obtain the Scarlet Epistle.
* [[Scarlet Zealot]] slain (3)
* [[Scarlet Missionary]] slain (3)
* [[Urgent Scarlet Memorandum]]

==Description==
Information we've received from {{NPC||Executor Arren}} in [[Deathknell]] contain all the details we need to wipe the human infestation from the lands. According to the information, The [[Scarlet Crusade]] has assigned {{NPC||Captain Perrine}} and a brigade to the ruined tower southwest of [[Brill]].

Kill 3 of his zealots and 3 of his missionaries. And while you're there, see if you can dig up any other information about what they're up to.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2|25}}
* 700 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
We shall herd the Scarlet Crusade like cattle to their demise.

==Completion==
It sounds like we'll have to keep our eyes out for this {{NPC||Lilian Voss||Voss}} character. I don't expect any [[Forsaken]] to receive a reward if we capture her... I'm just worried she'll eventually turn against us.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Darkhound Pounding]] before heading out. Then head southwest to the Scarlet Watchdower, killing darkhounds along the way.

Any scarlet has a chance of dropping the item, including the named, {{NPC||Captain Perrine}}.

While out and about in southwest Tirisfal, relatively close to the border with Silverpine, a {{NPC||Worgen Infiltrator}} stands a chance of spawning.

This automatically offers the quest [[Escaped From Gilneas]].
