==Objectives==
Accept the Dark Ranger regalia.

==Completion==
For years, we [[dark ranger]]s worked as agents of the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee Queen]]. Now, under the leadership of the new [[Desolate Council|Forsaken council]], we serve a greater cause: shaping our people's future.

We cannot be certain what lies ahead. But I vow that the dark rangers will do everything in our power to defend this kingdom.

Your aid was crucial in helping us cleanse the [[ruins of Lordaeron]]. Take this, with our thanks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}

==Notes==
If you complete the quest on a [[hunter]], it will unlock the option to purchase [[Ensemble: Dark Ranger's Attire]] from [[Outfitter Reynolds]] at [[Trueshot Lodge]].
