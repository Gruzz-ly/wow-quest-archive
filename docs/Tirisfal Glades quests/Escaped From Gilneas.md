==Objectives==
Report the [[worgen]]'s presence to {{NPC||Executor Zygand}} at [[Brill]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Description==
As far as you know, a worgen [[rogue]] roaming in Tirisfal is a new development. This is something that Executor Zygand would certainly be interested in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||85}}
* 320 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
Hmm... yes, that makes sense. Since the worgen have come streaming out of Gilneas, I knew it would only be a matter of time before they arrived here in Tirisfal.

==Notes==
While out and about in southwest Tirisfal, relatively close to the border with [[Silverpine Forest]], a {{NPC||Worgen Infiltrator}} stands a chance of spawning on players. Hostile, but not attackable, it says:
:{{text|say|Worgen Infiltrator|You deserve to lose this land, for what you people did to us! Now back off, or face the wrath of the worgen!}}

Accept the quest, then complete what other objectives necessary before heading back to Brill to turn in.

==Progression==
{{Reaping the Reapers}}
