==Objectives==
Use the [[Group Finder]] to enter the dungeon, "The Headless Horseman," and defeat the Headless Horseman.
*[[Headless Horseman]] defeated

==Description==
Thomas retreated into the [[Scarlet Monastery]]. His ties to this place are strong, even when he is in his corrupted form.

Your name is <name>, yes? My husband trusted you to help him, and so I must ask the same. I intend to give chase, but I cannot save him alone.

Will you join me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*3x [[Tricky Treat]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Once more I have been saved from madness. How could I ever thank you enough?

==Notes==
Upon accept, Suzannah runs inside the Monastery through the instance line for the [[Scarlet Monastery (instance)|graveyard wing]]:
:{{Text|say|Suzannah|Make your preparations, then meet me inside when you're ready.}}

Queue for the holiday instance in [[Dungeon Finder]] and complete the encounter, which has been refreshed and is now a single phase from 100% to zero. Consider enabling Hard Mode for better odds on loot from the [[Loot-Filled Pumpkin]] by speaking with the wicker men just left of the entrance!
