'''A Walk with Ghosts''' concludes the Horde perspective of the [[Return to Lordaeron]] storyline, part of the [[Shadowlands epilogue]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Calia]] in the throne room of Lordaeron.
*Enter the [[Imperial chamber|Throne Room]] of Lordaeron
*Meet Calia in the throne room of Lordaeron.

==Description==
Reclaiming [[Ruins of Lordaeron|these ruins]] means a lot to the [[Forsaken]]. Especially since [[Fourth War|the war]] ended, our people have needed something to hold onto, to give us purpose in the wake of everything that's happened to us.

I saw Calia walk toward the throne room. That place holds many memories for her. Many ghosts.

We should check on her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* [[Return to Lordaeron]]

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. You have helped so much.

From here, I believe the Forsaken will rebuild and solidify their identity. Not just as former denizens of Lordaeron, but as their own people. A people I am proud to be one of.

==Notes==

Turning in this quest will restore the Ruins as a Forsaken hub, complete with vendors and a portal room. The "Portal to Tirisfal Glades" at the zeppelin towers in Orgrimmar, Northern Stranglethorn, and Howling Fjord become "Portal to Ruins of Lordaeron".

This quest is also required for the [[Undead (playable)|Forsaken]] heritage armor questline. Completing this quest automatically starts [[Unliving Summons]] for undead characters.
