==Objectives==
Defend [[Watcher Koranos]] from the constructs in [[Tomb of Tyr|the tomb]].
*Protect Koranos (0/100%)

==Description==
As [[Nozdormu]] could sense power lingering in the scale, I can sense [[Tyr]] here. It is in the very stones of this place.

I suspect the other constructs can sense it as well. They must have come here when Tyr was reforged. We must be on the right track.

If something of his presence still remains, [[Silver Scale|the scale]] should be able to gather it--with the help of this console. But the constructs may interpret our collection of Tyr's last memories as us trying to destroy them.

Keep them away if they awaken.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 71,350 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
The task was too great for this aged console, but our persistence has been rewarded.

The scale has something, but I am not sure what.

I am... uncertain I wish to return to [[Alexstrasza]] with just "something." The scale could contain nonsense corrupted by the console's failure. Or it could be what we need.

Perhaps another console could verify its contents?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''Koranos uses the [[Titan Console (Tirisfal Glades)|Titan Console]] and Travard casts Holy Barrier.''
