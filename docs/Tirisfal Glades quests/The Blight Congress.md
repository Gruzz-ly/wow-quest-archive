==Objectives==
Listen to the [[Forsaken]].
*Speak with [[Lilian Voss|Lilian]] to begin
*Listen to the discussion
*Speak to [[Calia Menethil|Calia]]
*Meet Calia Menethil outside of [[Brill]].

==Description==
We, the Forsaken, have been through a lot since the [[Battle for Lordaeron|destruction of Lordaeron]]. But we're determined to keep our home.

Why should we give up what we've fought so hard to carve out for ourselves?

Calia is still a relative newcomer in some ways, but obviously she's known to our people. How could she not be, as the sister of [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]] himself?

I hope we can move forward, and that she can really help. Her voice could be a powerful one, if she is really truly committed to the people.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
I expected that my presence might cause friction. But I'm grateful to Lilian for her mediation, and for giving me the chance to show that I am committed to helping the Forsaken people.

But now, I must prove it.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Lilian
:{{gossip|Let's begin.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|All right. What are we going to do about the plague in the [[Undercity]]?}}
:{{text|say|Deathstalker Commander Belmont|Don't you mean what are we going to do about her?}}
:{{text|say|Dark Ranger Velonara|We should focus on the blight. Faranell, do we have any more of your [[Plague Eater|plague eater]]s?}}
:{{text|say|Master Apothecary Faranell|This is my last one, and it's a puny thing. I can make more, but to be effective, they must be formulated to survive the plague!}}
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|If I may... Our allies in the [[Shadowlands]] might be able to provide insight. In particular, the plague-lords of [[Maldraxxus]].}}

;Speaking with Calia
:{{gossip|What do you propose?}}
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|Master Apothecary, what do you need to make your creation stronger?}}
:{{text|say|Master Apothecary Faranell|Nothing less than a pure, undiluted sample of that plague. From deep within its reaches.}}
:{{text|say|Calia Menethil|Very well. I will help acquire that sample for you.}}
:''The assembled start walking out of the inn.''
:{{text|say|Deathstalker Commander Belmont|That is one solution.}}
:{{text|say|Master Apothecary Faranell|She won't succeed.}}

==Progression==
{{Return to Lordaeron}}
