==Objectives==
Kill {{NPC||Maggot Eye}} and obtain his paw.
* [[Maggot Eye's Paw]]

==Description==
Maggot Eye is a foul beast, even by [[gnoll]] standards. He leads a band of renegade gnolls through the land, tearing up [[Tirisfal Glades|the glades]] and stealing whatever corpses he can find along the way.

Those are our corpses! We had plans for those!

Maggot Eye resides just up the path from us. Show him no mercy. Mercy is for the weak.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Foul Gnoll Belt
|Belt of Brill
|Garren's Leggings
|Waistguard of Brill
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Excellent work! Now if only I can convince Jerrod to let us move our operation into that shack...

== Notes ==
Head northwest to the shack at {{coords|58.7|30.8|Tirisfal Glades}} north of Garren's Haunt. Maggot Eye is guarded by a few gnolls, so take them out before taking him on.

==Progression==
{{Garren's Haunt}}
