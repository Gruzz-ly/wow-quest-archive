==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Magistrate Sevren}} at [[Brill]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].
* [[Devlin's Remains]] (provided)

==Description==
I have destroyed the remains you've given me, <name>. That is, all remains except for these...

{{NPC||Devlin Agamand}} was weak and sharp-tongued in life, and was among the first to succumb to the [[Plague of Undeath|plague]]. He existed as a slave of the [[Scourge]] for a long time, longer than most. As such, he may possess knowledge that would be of value to us.

Bring his remains to Magistrate Sevren, and tell him what I've told you. He'll know what to do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||70}}
* 80 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
The fetor of Scourge hangs about you, <name>. What is it you seek?

==Completion==
Devlin Agamand? Is that him you carry in your sack there? Ha!

Yes, I know what {{NPC||Coleman Farthing||Coleman}} wants to try, and I want to try it too. I hope you're prepared, <name>.

==Notes==
Take the east path away from Farthing back to Brill&mdash;it's a shorter run.

==Progression==
{{Garren's Haunt}}
