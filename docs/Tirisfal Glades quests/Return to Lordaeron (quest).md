==Objectives==
Take the portal to return to the Ruins of Lordaeron.
*Take the portal to [[Ruins of Lordaeron]]

==Description==
Let's get back behind the walls and meet the others. I think [[Belmont]] had the time of his unlife with you, getting to cut down [[Scarlet Crusade|Scarlets]] again.

But this isn't the end of the Crusade. Even though they lost, they might still turn this into yet another way to recruit.

We'll be ready if they ever come for us again. Or our neighbors.

Come on, let's get back to the Ruins of Lordaeron.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 850 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
We have to look out for ourselves. Who else will?

==Completion==
Welcome home.

We couldn't have won this without you, I hope you know.

==Notes==
[[File:Return to Lordaeron 2.jpg|thumb|The guards.]]
Speak with the Forsaken Dreadmage or take the portal.
:{{Gossip|quest=|Send me to the Ruins of Lordaeron in [[Tirisfal Glades]].}}

Back in the ruins, [[Royal Dreadguard]]s and [[Forsaken Deathguard (heritage)|Forsaken Deathguards]] stand and salute. Go to the courtyard. There a host of Forsaken are present - [[Aelthalyste]], [[Margix]], [[Angellene]], [[Emalora]], [[Apothecary Zinge]], [[Apothecary Keever]], [[Dark Ranger Cyndia]], [[Dark Ranger Clea]], [[Dark Ranger Anya]], [[Delaryn Summermoon]], [[Lee Scolio]], [[Alonsus Faol]], [[Bannerguard Knell]], [[Geribald Crooke]], [[Nem Shelley]], [[Captain Amalia Stone]], [[Dark Ranger Lenara]], [[Dark Ranger Vorel]], [[Lorash]], [[Forsaken Deathguard (heritage)|Forsaken Deathguard]]s, [[Forsaken Soldier (heritage)|Forsaken Soldiers]], [[Dark Ranger (heritage)|Dark Rangers]], and [[Banshee (heritage)|Banshees]].

;[[Lee Scolio]]'s gossip
:Good job out there. You really stuck the Scarlet Crusade where it hurt.

:In the ego. The heart, too, but mostly the ego.

:{{Gossip|Feel any better?}}
::Me? Feeling much better. Lady Calia fixed me up and it only hurt a little. That's how you know she cares.

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}

[[File:Return to Lordaeron 3.jpg|thumb|The Desolate Council.]]
In front of the entrance are the [[Desolate Council]] members and [[Derek Proudmoore]].

;[[Faranell]]'s gossip
:What a magnificent demonstration of the Apothecaries' might! Of course I kept a small sample of the explosive plague for safekeeping.

:And you never know when it might come in handy in the future. A good explosion solves so many problems.

;[[Velonara]]'s gossip
:We could not have achieved this without our combined forces. The Dark Rangers will always stand behind our people and protect them with bow and blade.

:Even if this existence sometimes feels like a curse, we are not alone. Our sisters and brothers in the black arrow stand assured.

;[[Belmont]]'s gossip
:Victory is ours today.

:Tomorrow, someone else might try to snatch it away from us. But we won't let them, will we?

:If they come after us, we will fight at every corner, with our backs to the wall, and until the marrow melts away inside us.

:And we will leave our enemies in a burning, fetid pile. You can count on that.

;[[Calia]]'s gossip
:It is good to have us all safely back within these walls. In my time with our people I have learned so much about their bravery -- and their fragility.

:We should never take this chance for granted. Nor let our differences weaken us. We are stronger together.

Turn in to Lilian.
