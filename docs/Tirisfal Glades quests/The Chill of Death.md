==Objectives==
Obtain five Duskbat Pelts.
* [[Duskbat Pelt]] (5)

==Description==
It's so cold, now. The [[Plague of Undeath]] crawls through my veins like an icy serpent. The [[mindless state]] will be upon me soon. But no doomed destiny will prevent me from serving our {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Dark Lady}}. When the call arose I sewed body bags for the fallen soldiers of Sylvanas's mighty army.

Now my hands shake from the chill. If you would bring me five Duskbat Pelts, I could sew myself a blanket. Help me, <name>, so that I can continue to serve the cause.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gretchen's Slippers

|Duskbat Mail Leggings
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Do you have five Duskbat Pelts yet, <name>?

==Completion==
I appreciate your efforts, <name>. May Sylvanas recognize your bravery one day. . .

== Notes ==
Plenty of duskbats can be found on and around the zeppelin tower hill south of [[Brill]].
