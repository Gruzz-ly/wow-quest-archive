==Completion==
<Velonara peers at you knowingly.>

It was a fair disguise, but I saw at once that you were not who you claimed to be.

Regardless, you risked your life to aid us. I will not forget that.

There are those among the [[kaldorei]] raised by [[Sylvanas]]' [[val'kyr]] who wish to return to their own. If [[Tyrande]] would have them back, they are free to go. The rest will be welcome in the ranks of the [[dark ranger]]s.

In recognition for your service to us, I offer this gift.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}

==Notes==
If you complete the quest on a [[hunter]], it will unlock the option to purchase [[Ensemble: Dark Ranger's Attire]] from [[Outfitter Reynolds]] at [[Trueshot Lodge]].
