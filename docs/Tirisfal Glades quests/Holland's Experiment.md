==Objectives==
Bring Holland's Special Drink to the {{NPC||Captured Mountaineer}}.
* [[Holland's Special Drink]] (provided)

==Description==
I am to understand that another one of those foolish Dwarven Mountaineers has just been captured. The [[deathguard]] has him stored here in this building, and they've assigned one of their own to persuade him not to escape.

Why don't you go see how the Captured Mountaineer enjoys this special drink I made for him? It contains a subtle hint of what {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||The Dark Lady}} has planned for the rest of [[Azeroth]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mountaineer's Belt (common)
|Gallow's End Gauntlets
|Mountaineer's Waistguard
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Why if I had my trusted rifle you'd be as good as dead, <class>. Just wait until the Steam Tank Brigade arrives to rescue me!

==Completion==
Ah, a drink at least. What matter of ale is this? I'm sure it's no [[Rhapsody Malt]] but I'll take anything to wet the old whistle at this point.

== Notes ==
Exit the back door of the building to find steps leading upstairs. Circle around back inside to find the mountaineer guarded by {{NPC||Deathguard Mort}}.

On completion:
:{{text|say|Captured Mountaineer|I raise my brew and hope to be rid of the likes of you! Cheers, you no good scoundrel, <name>!}}
:''The Captured Mountaineer drops dead to the ground.''

Talk to Holland again to continue the chain with [[Garren's Haunt]].

==Progression==
{{Reaping the Reapers}}
