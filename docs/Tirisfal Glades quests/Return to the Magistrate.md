==Objectives==
Return to {{NPC||Magistrate Sevren}} in [[Brill]].

==Description==
Now return to Magistrate Sevren with the information I gave you. He'll want it as soon as possible, so be swift.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||5}}
* 30 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
It is troubling to hear of the [[Scourge]] slipping past the [[Bulwark]]. Even now, they are ceaseless in their assaults.

But we will not give in. The [[Lich King]] is dead; we will not be taken again!
