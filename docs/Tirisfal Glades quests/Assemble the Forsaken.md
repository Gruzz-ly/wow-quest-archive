==Objectives==
Assemble Dark Ranger Velonara, Lillian{{Sic}} Voss, and Master Apothecary Faranell.
*Speak to [[Dark Ranger Velonara]]
*Speak to [[Lilian Voss]]
*Speak to [[Master Apothecary Faranell]]
*Meet Lilian Voss in the [[Brill Inn]].

==Description==
It's heartening to see progress has been made in rebuilding [[Brill]], but this is only a first step. The [[Ruins of Lordaeron|ruins of the capital]] remain inaccessible because of [[New Plague|the blight]].

And here is where I hope you will aid the cause.

Restoring as much of the land as possible will require a gathering of minds all working toward a singular purpose.

A number of influential figures have risen to prominence among the [[Forsaken]]. Please help bring them together so we can meet and discuss the path forward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Everyone is working hard to get back on their feet. Might not be the feet they started out with, but they work.

==Completion==
Looks like we're ready to get started.

I don't think there have been this many Forsaken in one place since... well, [[Darkshore]].

But we are in our own lands now, and it's time we take care of our own.

==Notes==
;Dark Ranger Velonara
Accepting [[This Land is Ours]] completes Velonara's criterion.

:{{text|say|Dark Ranger Velonara|I will join the meeting. But we must ensure that the outskirts of Brill are secure.}}

;Lilian Voss
:Lilian Voss is talking to [[Derek Proudmoore]] and [[Captain Amalia Stone]].''
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|And that's where we stand. Sylvanas is gone, and our homeland remains overrun with toxic blight.}}
:{{gossip|It's time to meet with the other Forsaken.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|I will attend this gathering. After all, someone needs to make sure Calia gets a chance to speak up for herself.}}

;Master Apothecary Faranell
:{{gossip|It's time to meet with the other Forsaken.}}
:{{text|say|Master Apothecary Faranell|Yes, yes, I will come. But first, behold as my creation eradicates the blight!}}
:''The [[Gargantuan Plague Eater]] runs into the [[blight]] and begins to devour it.''
:{{text|say|Master Apothecary Faranell|You may applaud at any time.}}
:''The Gargantuan Plague Eater succumbs to the blight and dies.''
:{{text|say|Master Apothecary Faranell|No! My beautiful construct! Dash it all, how can we hope to succeed now?!}}

==Progression==
{{Return to Lordaeron}}
