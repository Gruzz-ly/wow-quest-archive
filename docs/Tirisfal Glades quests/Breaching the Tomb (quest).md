==Objectives==
Disable the Titan Orbs at the entrance to [[Tomb of Tyr|the tomb]].
*[[Broken Titan Orb|Broken Orb]] Inspected
*[[Titan Orb]] Activated

==Description==
Something recently activated the tomb's [[titan]] defense system. I had not seen titan constructs here before.

I was investigating why they appeared when I was locked out of the tomb. Perhaps your mission awakened them.

Should we intend to venture forth, we must disarm the new defenses. The glowing orbs flanking the doors might be the key. If only they weren't damaged...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Your mission has renewed my faith. Now, what must we do to restore [[Tyr]]?

==Notes==
Before accepting the quest, Travard has gossip:

{{Dialogue|
It has been a long time since another person has visited Tyr's tomb.

My vigil is to guard both Tyr's tomb and the site of Tyr's Guard's final battle.

{{gossip|It is good to see you again.}} (''paladin only'')
{{Dialogue-child|
And you, my friend. Do you still wield the Silver Hand? Keep it close. It may yet yield power once again.

There is much we need to discuss, but we must tend to our duties first. The presence of so many of Tyr's creations in this tomb will not go unnoticed. 
}}
{{gossip|What happened to Tyr's Guard?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I am the last of Tyr's Guard. My comrades fell defending me from Mordoth the Hunter during our mission to find Tyr's Silver Hand...

When I learned the tomb had not collapsed completely, the least I could do was stand vigil here. 

The paladins of the Silver Hand still remain, but after I am gone, Tyr's Guard will be no more.
}}
{{gossip|What are you doing here?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
This is where my charges in Tyr's Guard met their end. I stand vigil over their final resting place and that of Tyr's.

Even though the tomb has been seized by machines of titan make, I will not leave here unless the tomb is destroyed... or I have reason to take up another cause.
}}}}

On accept:
:{{Text|say|Travard|The tomb's defense system reactivated not long ago. I know not why.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|It locked me out and appears to be broken. I was trying my best to repair it when you came in.}}

Inspect the Broken Titan Orb:
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|Since it is Titan [[technology]], I may be able to fix it. <Name>, will you try the other one?}}
:''Koranos repairs the orb.''
:{{Text|say|Travard|By the [[Light]]! You really are one of Tyr's creations.}}

Activate the other orb:
:{{Text|say|Travard|The seal has been breached. Quickly! Into the main chamber before it closes again!}}
:''The pair heads inside and stand on the central platform.''

Follow them and inside to find [[Silver Golem]]s and [[Titan Knowledge Matrix]]es.
