'''Gordo's Task''' is a low-level [[Horde]] quest in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Objectives==
Collect 3 Gloom Weed and deliver them to {{npc||Junior Apothecary Holland}} in [[Brill]].
*[[Gloom Weed]] (3)

==Description==
Master want weeds. {{npc||Gordo||Us}} gots big hands and not good at picking. You help us and we not hurt you. Us need gloom weed. Many weeds around here and near road.

When you have gloom weed you take to Master Holland in Brill.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||65}}
* 270 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Where's that useless abomination? Either you have what I need or you'd best get out there and find it. 

==Completion==
What's this? Gloom weed?! I've no need for gloom weed! That mindless mass of flesh is out there picking daisies and convincing the Lady knows how many dupes like you into doing the same. No offense.

We'll deal with the gloom weed later.  For now, we've got other matters to discuss.

==Notes==
*Gloom Weed is generally found in the fields between [[Brill]] and [[Deathknell]].
*Players with the [[Herbalism]] skill will be able to detect Gloom Weed on their [[minimap]] by using [[Find Herbs]].
*Sometimes it's better to go west of Gordo's path to get Gloom Weed, just east of [[Solliden Farmstead]], because he doesn't pull out the Gloom Weed in the area.

==Progression==
