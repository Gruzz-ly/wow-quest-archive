==Objectives==
Mount a Shadowbat and deploy Plague Eaters in the Ruins of Lordaeron.
*Mount [[Shadowbat (Tirisfal Glades)|Shadowbat]]
*Drop Plague Eaters in [[Ruins of Lordaeron]] (0/100%)
*[[Amalgam]] slain
*Meet Lilian Voss in the courtyard of the Ruins of Lordaeron.

==Description==
The time has come. By the [[Light]], I pray our plan works.

[[Master Apothecary Faranell]]'s [[wagon]]s have reproduced the plague eater many times over, and the bats are ready to deploy them.

If you see a place where our forces could spread even more of the remedy, you can signal them with a flare.

Take to the skies, and let's put an end to this blight. For [[Lordaeron (kingdom)|Lordaeron]], and for the [[Forsaken]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|77|22}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]
* +1500 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
We did it. By working together, we've cleared the surface level of the deadly plague cloud.

It will take more time to clean up the lower reaches of the [[Undercity]], but it's a fine start.

Most of the characters have a new gossip text:

;Calia's gossip
:I have not been here for many years. The memories that linger... It's such a mixture of pain and comfort.

;Velonara's gossip
:The shadows of the past will never fully vanish, but we are stronger now. We will face whatever comes.

;Faranell's gossip
:The plague eaters worked marvelously, don't you think?

:<Faranell sucks in a deep breath through what remains of his nose>

:Aah, I missed the smell of this place.
