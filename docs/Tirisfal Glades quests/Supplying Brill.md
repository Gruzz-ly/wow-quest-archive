==Objectives==
Bring Morris's Order to [[Bat Handler Anette]].
*[[Morris's Order]] (provided)

==Description==
{{NPC||Executor Zygand}} asked me to take stock of our equipment here in [[Brill]]. With the [[Scourge]], and worse, lurking in the woods, he doesn't want the [[Deathguard]]s to lack gear they might need.

I found that we are, in general, well stocked, but we do need more weapons to replace those lost in the field.

Here is a requisition order of what is needed, for the weapon dealer {{NPC||Gordon Wendham}} in the [[Undercity]]. Take the order to Bat Handler Anette and speak with her about transport to the Undercity.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 210 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
You appear to be on official business...

==Completion==
Ah, an order for supplies. You will want to take this to the Undercity, no doubt. And quickly, for Brill must not be left under stocked.

==Progression==
