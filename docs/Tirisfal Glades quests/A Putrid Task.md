==Objectives==
Bring 7 Putrid Claws to {{NPC||Deathguard Dillinger}} in [[Coldhearth Manor]].
* [[Putrid Claw]]

==Description==
[[Scourge]] have trickled into [[Tirisfal Glades]] and have infested this area.

I need someone to beat back the {{NPC||Rotting Dead||rotting dead}} and {{NPC||Ravaged Corpse||ravaged corpses}} that have taken this small farm. Scatter their bones and bring back their putrid claws. The [[Deathguard]]s will reward you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1}}
* 410 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Have you completed the task with which I have charged you? Do you have those putrid claws?

==Completion==
Well done. I enjoyed watching you smash those undead into rotting pulp!

==Notes==
On the path to [[Brill]] after collecting three [[Gloom Weed]] for [[Gordo's Task]], players reach [[Cold Hearth Manor]]. There, [[Deathguard Dillinger]] offers this quest and [[The New Forsaken]].

==Progression==
{{Reaping the Reapers}}
