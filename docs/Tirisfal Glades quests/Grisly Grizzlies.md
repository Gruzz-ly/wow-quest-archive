==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Plagued Bruin Hides.
*[[Plagued Bruin Hide]] x5

==Description==
Have you seen the {{NPC||Plagued Bruin||plagued bruins}} that wander to the west of here?  Those hides... so hideous, so diseased, so... perfect!

Fetch me 5 of them.  I've got an idea for an anti-[[Scourge]] poison that's guaranteed to succeed!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3}}
* 150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Let's see... do you have enough hides?

==Completion==
{{NPC||Apothecary Dithers||Dithers}}, you've done it again! These are perfect.

==Notes==
Pick up [[At War With The Scarlet Crusade]] before heading out.

Head northeast from the [[Bulwark]] toward the [[Balnir Farmstead]] killing {{NPC||Plagued Bruin}}s along the way. Take out the Scarlets just north of the farm at the [[Crusader Outpost]], then circle around back to the Bulwark, killing more bruins. More bears can be found west of the farm if necessary.

==Progression==
{{Garren's Haunt}}
