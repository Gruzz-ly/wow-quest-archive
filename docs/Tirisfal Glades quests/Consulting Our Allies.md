==Objectives==
Speak to [[Margrave Sin'dane]] in [[Maldraxxus]].

==Description==
I hope [[Calia]] is right about these lords of Maldraxxus. That they know how to deal with this sort of powerful plague.

We've only got [[Plague Eater|one plague eater]] left, too, but [[Faranell]] says he can replicate more of them as long as they're strong enough to survive.

Let's get to the [[Shadowlands]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
You carry a rather nasty example of the unchecked and unfettered ambition of a plague-maker.

I trust the creator of this monstrosity has already been purged. What would you ask of the houses of Maldraxxus?

==Notes==
