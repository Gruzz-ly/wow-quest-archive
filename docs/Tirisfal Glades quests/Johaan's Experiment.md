==Objectives==
Take the Laced Pumpkin to the {{NPC||Captured Scarlet Zealot}} at the gazebo at [[Calston Estate]].
* [[Laced Pumpkin]] (provided)

==Description==
Harmless pumpkins, right? Or so it would seem. If we are to defeat the [[Scourge]] advances from the North and the human infestation from the South we need to start realizing the full potential of our gift of undeath.

With a little ingenuity a simple pumpkin becomes an agent for our {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Dark Lady}}. This pumpkin, laced with my latest formula, will prove to be quite a treat.

Yet another Scarlet Zealot has been captured and is being kept outside, by the gazebo. Take this pumpkin to the fool.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||35}}
* 55 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Stay away, foul and unholy creature! May the Light protect me! The Scarlet Crusade shall rid [[Azeroth]] of your...

...oh wait. Is that food for me? I am so hungry...

==Completion==
By the Light! Finally some food! Sweet, sweet pumpkin...
