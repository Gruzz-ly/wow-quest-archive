==Objectives==
Bring Gordon's Crate to {{NPC||Michael Garrett}}.
* [[Gordon's Crate]] (provided)

==Description==
I have placed [[Brill]]'s supplies into this crate. If you have already visited Brill and spoken with their bat master, then you may ride a bat back to her.

Speak with the [[Undercity]]'s bat master, Michael Garrett. He can provide you with a bat to Brill.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 50 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
If you must travel a long distance, then a bat is your best option.

==Completion==
This crate must reach Brill quickly? That is easily done; out bats fly there daily.

==Progression==
{{Supplying Brill}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added, replacing [[Michael Garrett (Classic)|previous version]].}}
