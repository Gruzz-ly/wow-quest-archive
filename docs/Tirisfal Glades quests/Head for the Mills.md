==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Coleman Farthing}} at [[Agamand Mills]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Description==
The Agamand Mills, to the west, have been lost to the [[Scourge]]. The [[Agamand]] family has been slain, and the entire residence has been claimed by the Scourge.

This is probably the largest Scourge outpost in [[Tirisfal]], <name>. If you think you're enough of a <class>, head up there and speak with Coleman Farthing. He's been doing his best to take the land back, and he'll need help. Just follow this road, it'll take you right to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||70}}
* 80 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
Argh! Get back! Oh, you're not Scourge, are you?

Thank the {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Banshee Queen}} that you're here. I've greatly underestimated how bad it's gotten up here.

==Notes==
Follow the road to the west past the hut and up in the mountains, Coleman will be standing at a windmill to the left on top of the hill.

==Progression==
