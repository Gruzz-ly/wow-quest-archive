==Objectives==
Obtain 5 Vile Fin Scales.
* [[Vile Fin Scale]] (5)

==Description==
While you were collecting samples for me, my experiments led me to realize that more reagents will be required for this new disease to spread properly. Poisoning some hapless victim is child's play. Plaguing an entire world proves to be a bit more complicated.

I will need several scales from [[murloc]]s in the vicinity. You will find the creatures ambling brainlessly along the coast to the north.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cauldron Gloves
|Vile Fin Belt
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||2|25}}
* 700 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
<Name>, were you able to obtain those scales from the murlocs?

==Completion==
The scales are perfect, <name>. Exactly what I needed for this concoction.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Planting the Seed of Fear]] before heading out.

==Progression==
