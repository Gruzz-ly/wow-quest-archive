==Objectives==
Witness the formation of the new Desolate Council.
*Witness the Formation of the [[Desolate Council]]

==Description==
By combining our knowledge and expertise, we've restored the surface of the [[Undercity]] to the [[Forsaken]].

It was only possible by setting aside our distrust and acting for the good of our people. Now it's time to make this council official.

We are no longer the same [[undead]] that followed and served [[Sylvanas Windrunner]]. From here on, we lead ourselves, with the same spirit of independence and pride we've had since we reclaimed our free will.

It's time for a new future, with new leadership.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Hope, and fresh air, have been restored.

==Completion==
I am greatly honored that they have accepted me as part of the new leadership of the Forsaken.

I swear that I will do my best to protect and preserve the people, no matter where they come from, or what form of undeath has created them.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|[[Lilian Voss]]|No more excuses. No more Banshee Queen. The Forsaken have many different points of view, and we should be led by a council, not a single ruler.}}
:{{text|say|[[Dark Ranger Velonara]]|My fellow [[dark ranger]]s and I are with you.}}
:{{text|say|[[Deathstalker Commander Belmont]]|Are we really going to trust a Menethil on the council?}}
:{{text|say|[[Calia Menethil]]|I cannot escape the shadows of my past, but I have no desire for a throne. My place is here among you, and I vow to serve all our people.}}
:{{text|say|[[Master Apothecary Faranell]]|I take you at your word, Lady Menethil. And we, [[Royal Apothecary Society|the Apothecaries]], will help shape our brighter future.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Then it's settled. We are the Desolate Council. We are the Forsaken.}}

Lilian's new gossip is now also visible:
:The Forsaken are stronger when we're united. Look at what we've done! Now, we can build our future from here.

;Upon completion
:''Calia starts walking toward the throne room, while Belmont and Faranell go into the eastern part of the city.''
:{{Text|say|Calia Menethil|So many memories...}}
