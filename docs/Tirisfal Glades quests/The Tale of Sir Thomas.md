'''The Tale of Sir Thomas''' concludes the 2023 [[Hallow's End]] questline.

==Objectives==
Return to the Orphan Matron.
*[[Tome of Thomas Thomson (A Ghostly Message)]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Suzannah]]... I never thought I would find her. Now we can return to our children, and rest at last. All thanks to you, <name>.

Do you still have my tome? My story has reached its end, and I would see it penned by my own hand.

<Thomas glides his finger across a blank page, spectral ink marking his words.>

Please return this to the Orphan Matron. And... please apologize on my behalf for frightening her, would you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}

==Completion==
It is over, then? The Headless Horseman is defeated once more, and the fallen [[paladin]] is free and at rest.

The tales the [[Forsaken]] tell of the devastation the [[Scourge]] wrought on [[Lordaeron]] would make anyone fall to madness. Despite that, the paladin's strength and dedication to his family never wavered. Admirable, I think.

Thank you, <name>. Your compassion for that poor soul is just as admirable--and appreciated.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|It is done. The [[Headless Horseman]] is no more.}}
:{{Text|say|Suzannah|Then let us rest, my love. At long last.}}
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|[[Thomson|My family]] is whole again... as is my soul. I cannot thank you enough, champions.}}
:''Thomas and Suzannah walk away and disappear.''

Sir Thomas adds a seventh page to [[Tome of Thomas Thomson (A Ghostly Message)]]:

{{book|content=
<The final page of the book now contains a poem, penned in the same elegant script.>

Though once brought low and lost to fright,

At last Sir Thomas has seen the Light.

His spirit at peace, his love returned,

The shackles that bound him now broken and burned.

Thus ends his tale of woe untold,

Saved by the hand of a hero bold.
}}

Return to [[Stormwind]] or [[Undercity]] to turn in.
