==Objectives==
Look for your new ally at the [[Scarlet Encampment]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Description==
Shortly before you arrived at the [[Bulwark]], I was approached by the most unusual young undead woman. She swore enmity against the [[Scarlet Crusade]], so I sent her to work on our enemies to the north. You say you saw some dead crusaders earlier? Those were probably her work.

Go check up on her, and see if she can use any assistance in her vendetta against the Crusade... though I wouldn't be surprised if she's already killed them all.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|75}}
* 420 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
As you look over the ruins of the camp, you hear a whisper behind you.

<"I could kill you right now if I wanted to. You'd better watch your step, <race>.">

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Little Oomph]] before heading out.

Run north from the Bulwark along the foothills to reach [[Venomweb Vale]]. Kill enough spiders to collect 4 venom samples, but then keep heading north for A Deadly New Ally. Players will head back to the Bulwark later.

Look for a Scarlet camp in the middle of the venomweb vale. Nearly everyone has been killed, except for {{NPC||Lieutenant Sanders}}, who is hanging upside down from a meat hook. {{NPC||Lilian Voss}} is speaking to the player from the shadows.

==Progression==
