==Objectives==
Meet Alonsus Faol at Scarlet Monastery.
*Stay Awhile and Listen to [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]] (Optional)
*Enter the [[Scarlet Monastery]] (Optional)
*Meet Faol inside the Monastery
*Enter [[Scarlet Halls]]

==Description==
These artifacts will help sustain the [[Vanguard of the Light|Vanguard]]. But they are not enough. I know of a place nearby that would have the rest we need. But given [[Arator the Redeemer|Arator]]'s state of mind I'm hesitant to go there.

Hmph... No sense in avoiding it, we must all face up to the fact that [[Scarlet Crusade]] calls upon the power of the [[Light]], and has for decades.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|11|70}}
*6,710 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I trust you found what you needed, <name>?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Arator|The Scarlet Crusade? You, of all people, want to spread their Light?}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|They claimed many relics when they seized my church. Relics that would be better used to our purpose of holding back [[Xal'atath]].}}

Speak to Arator:
{{dialogue|It's so strange to me that the Light responds to the Scarlets just as it does to me, Faol, or Lord Tyrosus, <name>.

{{gossip|quest=|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I can scarcely believe that the Light answers their call.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I was always taught that the Light was good. The Crusade is... unconscionable.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|The Light seeks a path. It does not dictate the way.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|Look at all the cultures across [[Azeroth]] that channel the Light. From [[Elune]], to [[Gral]], to [[An'she]].}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|Philosophically different from our [[Church of Holy Light]], but with the same ability to channel the energy.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|I have often wondered.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|The Light needs a lens to focus its power through the wielder. The Light brings certainty, and it responds to one's conviction.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|But the Light cannot distinguish between love and hatred.}}
:{{Text|Say|Arator|So that is why the Scarlet Crusade claims it acts according to the Light's will.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|And why they were able to pervert my teachings of fellowship and protection into something you and I recognize so clearly as evil.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|The Scarlet Crusade was founded by [[Saidan Dathrohan|a paladin]] I personally anointed. For a long time, I saw them as my own misjudgment made manifest. Perhaps I still do.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|However... the relics they possess will do for our purposes of bolstering the [[Sunwell]] defenders.}}
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|It... will be good to reclaim them.}}

Head to the [[Tirisfal Glades]] and meet up with Alonsus Faol at the Monastery.
:{{Text|Say|Alonsus Faol|You're here, <name>. We should join Arator inside. My sermon to these fanatics is falling on deaf ears.}}

Upon entering the Scarlet Halls, Alonsus has a new gossip:
{{dialogue|This place has seen better days, when it was truly in the service of the church of the Light.

Originally, under [[Saidan Dathrohan|Saidan]] and [[Alexandros Mograine|Alexandros]], It did much good in Lordaeron.

But the Crusade was misled over time into hatred of the other, which has guided the{{sic}} their actions for decades.}}
