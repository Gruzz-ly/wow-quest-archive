==Objectives==
Bring {{NPC||Lilian Voss}} to her father in the tower at [[Crusader's Run]].
* Lilian's Mission Accomplished

==Description==
The whisper continues:

<"My name is Lilian Voss. Before I died, I was a member of the [[Scarlet Crusade]]. My father, {{NPC||Benedictus Voss||High Priest Voss}}, raised me to be a weapon against the plagued. I studied stealth, sorcery, martial arts, anything to make myself stronger. I gave up my childhood for him.">

<"Then, as fate would have it, I died and returned as... this. My father instantly forgot me and, when I returned, ordered me executed.">

<"Come. We will speak with him now, in his tower to the northwest.">

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Darrington's Dirk
|Lilian's Staff
|Executor's Breastplate
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||7}}
* 1050 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

{{itembox||Headsman's Bag
}}

==Progress==
You should speak with Miss Voss, <name>. She seems concerned about something.

==Completion==
From birth to undeath, we all have our own path to follow. Some are easier than others. It sounds like this Voss girl has had a rough path so far.

Hopefully she ultimately chooses to join us and follow the {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Dark Lady}}. With power like hers, we could do incredible things.

By the way, <name>... excellent work out there. If you're ever ready and willing, I may have some work for you in the [[Plaguelands]].

== Notes ==
On accept, Lilian steps out of the shadows and follows the player. Head to the northwest, past the [[Scarlet Monastery]] meeting stone at {{co|82.0|39.3|Tirisfal Glades}} to reach the path to [[Crusader's Run]]. Along the way, players will reach the [[Scarlet Watch Post]], which is heavily guarded. Lilian, however, is a one-woman killing machine. She can singlehandedly take care of the entire squadron of Scarlets, but don't go crazy, she is not that tough and it is possible for her to get taken down. If that happens, the player needs to die too then run to their corpse - Lilian will respawn once the player revives. Keep heading north along the path to the tower.

Enter the tower and Lilian will run in, making the mobs in the tower turn friendly.
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Father!}}
:{{text|say|High Priest Benedictus Voss|Lilian... you're... it's so nice to see you well.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Shut up.}}
:''Lilian jumps on the Scarlet Bodyguard and {{NPC||Captain Melrache}}, killing them instantly.''
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|You raised me to be a killer. How am I doing, daddy?}}
:{{text|say|High Priest Benedictus Voss|I, ah...}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|But wait... I remember now. You taught me to only kill the undead. So you do want me to kill myself, daddy?}}
:{{text|say|High Priest Benedictus Voss|Lilian, I...}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|Then again, why kill myself... when I can kill YOU instead!}}
:''Lilian grabs Benedictus and climbs up the walls of the towers, strangling and killing him in the process.''

''Quickly'' get out of the area before the Scarlets repop, as Lilian will not be around to help. Make sure to kill enough spiders to collect the required four [[Vicious Night Web Spider Venom]] for [[A Little Oomph]] before returning to the [[Bulwark]].
