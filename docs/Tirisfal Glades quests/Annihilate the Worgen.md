Find and kill 5 Worgen Infiltrators within [[Brill]].

==Description==
These [[worgen]] must be dealt with, and quickly. Our first priority is to eliminate any which may have infiltrated brill.

I want you to be on the lookout four any suspicious activity here in Brill, <name>. We know that these worgen can hide in the shadows, so look for any signs you can find... footsteps, kicked-up rocks... anything.

==Rewards==

|Worgen Slaying Sword
|Executor's Cape
|Worgen Training Stick
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
By {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Sylvanas}}, these worgen will NOT undo the progress we've made!

==Completion==
To think, they've been right under our noses! I'll put my deathguards on alert... this will NOT happen again.

==Notes==
On accept, players are buffed with Vigilance: You are on the lookout for worgen footprints around Brill. Wander around the area looking for dust getting kicked up. Get close and wind up an attack.
