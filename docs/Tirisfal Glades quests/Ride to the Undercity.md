==Objectives==
Request a [[bat]] ride to the [[Undercity]] from the bat master {{NPC||Bat Handler Anette}}, then take Morris's Order to {{NPC||Gordon Wendham}} in the Undercity.
* [[Morris's Order]] (provided)

==Description==
One of my bats can take you to the Undercity. Normally these flights require a small fee, but the flight to Undercity is complimentary for a <handsome/lovely> <race> like you. Speak with me again when you are ready so that we may arrange your transport.

You will find Gordon Wendham in the [[Trade Quarter]] of the Undercity. That is the same quarter where my bat will land.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||30}}
* 100 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
I keep my weapons in top condition. They are cleaned and ready for use.

==Completion==
An order from [[Brill]]? Very well. It is an honor to serve those who serve our {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Dark Lady}}.

==Progression==
{{Supplying Brill}}
