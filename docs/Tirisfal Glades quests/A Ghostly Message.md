'''A Ghostly Message''' begins a short quest chain added to [[Hallow's End]] for the 2023 iteration of the holiday. Find [[Orphan Matron Seacole]] just outside the gates to [[Stormwind City]], or [[Orphan Matron Nanee]] outside [[Undercity]] to begin.

==Objectives==
Look for [[Thomas Thomson]] near the [[Scarlet Monastery]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].
*Find Thomas Thomson{{Co|81.23|44.53|Tirisfal Glades}}
*[[Tome of Thomas Thomson (A Ghostly Message)]] (provided)

==Description==
You there, <name> is it? You've made quite a name for yourself lately, for both the living and the dead.

I have in my possession the Tome of [[Thomas Thomson]]. Apparently it belonged to a crazed [[paladin]] of the [[Scarlet Crusade]]. Imagine my surprise when the tome flings itself to the floor, falling open to a page with a single name on it.

Yours, <name>.

If Thomas' [[Ghost|spirit]] is trying to reach you, I think you should take this. Perhaps he awaits at the Scarlet Monastery?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}

==Completion==
At last, <name>. I knew you would come.

I am once again in need of aid, and an [[adventurer]] of your caliber would be most welcome.

==Notes==
;Upon approach
:{{Text|say|Sir Thomas|The Scarlet Monastery... It seems I cannot put this horrid place behind me just yet.}}

==Progression==
