==Objectives==
Return to Master Apothecary Faranell outside of the [[Ruins of Lordaeron]].
*Speak to [[Master Apothecary Faranell]]
*[[Lilian's Hearthstone]] (provided)

==Description==
We've strengthened our [[Plague Eater|plague eater]], and now it looks ready to take on a much, much bigger meal.

Let's get it back to Faranell. He said he can replicate its properties and disperse plague eaters all across the ruins.

Then maybe, just maybe, we can set foot in our home again.

Here, take my hearthstone. It'll bring you back to [[Brill]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
What have you brought me?

==Completion==
Wonderful! Not only did you manage not to lose my plague eater, you brought it back stronger than ever!

Now, witness the genius and rapidity of my machines. There will be more than enough plague eaters to spread across the surface of the Undercity.
