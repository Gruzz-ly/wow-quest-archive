==Objectives==
Obtain 4 samples of Vicious Night Web Spider Venom. 
* [[Vicious Night Web Spider Venom]] x4

==Description==
<{{NPC||Apothecary Dithers||Dithers}} samples his latest concoction.>

Hmm... this isn't quite there. It needs something to give at a little more zing. I've got it! The spiders to the north have a potent venom that'll do the trick. See if you can extract some for me, <name>? 

==Progress==
Do you have some venom from a {{NPC||Vicious Night Web Spider}} yet, <name>? It's the final component I need in order to test my experiment.

==Completion==
Ah, this venom will do perfectly, <name>. Everything else has been added to my concoction and boiled down. Thank you, <class>!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Night Web Gloves|Advanced Night Web Crossbow|Reaper's Buckler}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
* 150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Deadly New Ally]] before heading out.

Run north from the Bulwark along the foothills to reach [[Venomweb Vale]]. Kill enough spiders to collect 4 venom samples, but then keep heading north for A Deadly New Ally. Players will head back to the Bulwark later, on [[A Daughter's Embrace]].
