==Objectives==
Slay Blighted Soldiers in [[Tirisfal Glades]].
*[[Blighted Soldier]]s and [[Blighted Shadowmage|Shadowmages]] slain (8)
*Meet [[Dark Ranger Velonara]] in the [[Brill Inn]].

==Description==
[[New Plague|The plague]] unleashed during [[Battle for Lordaeron|the war]] has tainted the land and disturbed the dead. That is to say, more so than they already were.

We have worked hard to rebuild, but our people cannot complete their efforts while under threat.

My first duty is to ensure the safety of the [[Forsaken]]. I will meet with the others as [[Calia Menethil|Calia]] requests, but first you must help me eradicate some of these Blighted.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
We need the pressure off of [[Brill]] so we can continue to rebuild.

==Completion==
That should give our guards some breathing room. Metaphorically speaking, of course.

Thank you for the help, <name>.

==Notes==
;Upon quest acceptance
:{{text|say|Dark Ranger Velonara|I will join the meeting. But we must ensure that the outskirts of Brill are secure.}}
