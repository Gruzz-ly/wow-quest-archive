==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Timothy Cunningham}} at the [[Bulwark]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Description==
There isn't much more glory for you here on the Bulwark, <name>. You've done enough already. There may, however, be further adventures waiting in [[Silverpine Forest]].

Speak with my bat man, Timothy Cunningham. He'll give you a ride to [[Brill]], free of charge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||35}}
* 85 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
Sure, I'll give you a ride. If {{NPC||High Executor Derrington}} asks for it, then technically I have to.

==Progression==
{{Garren's Haunt}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
