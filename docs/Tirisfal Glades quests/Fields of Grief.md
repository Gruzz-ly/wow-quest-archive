==Objectives==
Steal 10 pumpkins from the [[Solliden Farmstead]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].
* [[Tirisfal Pumpkin]] (10)

==Description==
What have we here? You look like a fledgling <class>. If you hope to prove yourself to [[Sylvanas Windrunner|the Dark Lady]], you need to learn the ways of the Forsaken.

To the west you'll find a farm. Humans infest the land like mold on a rotting corpse. And worse yet, the [[Scarlet Crusade]] patrols nearby from their tower. Teach those scum a lesson and steal 10 of their precious pumpkins.

Once you have 10, bring them back to me.

==Reward==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|25}}
*410 [[XP]] (or {{cost||2|40}} at level 85)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Were you able to gather 10 pumpkins yet, <name>?

==Completion==
You have performed your bidding well, young <class>.  You are proving yourself to be quite an asset to the Dark Lady's army.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Reaping the Reapers]] before heading out. Also, {{NPC||Sedrick Calston}} offers [[Ever So Lonely]] upstairs.

Exit the estate and head west-northwest to reach the farmstead, then go killing and looting. After that, head to the north to reach the beach and capture a [[murloc]] by wounding one down to below 50% health and using the leash on it. Then head back to the estate.

This quest used to be given by [[Deathguard Simmer]] prior to the Cataclysm.

==Progression==
