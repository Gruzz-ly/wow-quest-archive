==Objectives==
Collect 5 Vials of Darkhound Blood.
* [[Darkhound Blood]] (5)

==Description==
{{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Lady Sylvanas}} has called upon the [[Royal Apothecary Society]]. She has challenged us to concoct a new plague, a plague deadlier than any ailment on [[Azeroth]]. This new disease will bring our enemies - living and dead - to ruin.

My studies show that the blood of beasts might prove to be the key. Here, fill these vials with [[darkhound]] blood so I can test my theory.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||1|25}}
* 270 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the dark hound blood yet, <name>? Time is fleeting!

==Completion==
You have done well, <name> and I think you for your efforts.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Thorn in our Side]] before heading out.

Plenty of darkhounds can be found southwest of Brill, outside of [[Cold Hearth Manor]] and north of [[Undercity]].

While out and about in southwest Tirisfal, relatively close to the border with Silverpine, a {{NPC||Worgen Infiltrator}} stands a chance of spawning.

This automatically offers the quest [[Escaped From Gilneas]].
