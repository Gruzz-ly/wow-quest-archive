==Objectives==
Use the [[Titan Console (Tirisfal Glades)|Titan Console]] to witness [[Tyr]]'s final memories.
*Place the Silver Scale in the Titan Console
*Witness Tyr's Fall
*[[Silver Scale]] (provided)

==Description==
This console will allow us to examine the scale's contents, but I do not know what we will find.

The other [[titan]] servants here should leave us alone; accessing it should not be as disruptive as transferring what we sensed of [[Tyr]].

Something is making [[Travard]] uneasy. Be prepared for anything, <name>.

Place the Silver Scale in the console when you are ready to proceed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|56|18}}
*71,350 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
There is much we still do not know about Tyr.

==Completion==
Such nobility even in his final moments. [[Zakajz]] used the [[dragon]]s to taunt him... But did Tyr really know they would betray them? Will [[Alexstrasza]]?

This would be a great blow to them...

If Tyr cannot be raised, perhaps it is not something they need to know.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''The pair approach the console, and the [[Damaged Titan Matrix]] moves away slightly.''
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|Pardon me, friend. We require the console.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|Now... how does this work exactly?}}
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|I am unsure... We will find out shortly.}}

Interact with the Titan Console:
{{book|content=
The console is identical to the ones found in [[Tyrhold]].

It looks as if it is newer than the one in the upper tomb or has been repaired.

{{Gossip|<Place the Silver Scale in the console.>}}
}}

A new option appears:
{{book|content=
{{Gossip|<Witness the final memories of Tyr.> {{Text|rare|(Start Scenario)}}}}
}}

This starts the "Tyr's Fall" scenario.

===Stage 1: The Eastern Glades===
[[File:VZ-Tyr's Fall.jpg|thumb|The scenario map of the Eastern Glades.]]
[[File:Tyr's Fall - Keeper Tyr.jpg|thumb|upright|Keeper Tyr.]]
:Rescue the vrykul from the flesh spawn.
*[[Flesh Spawn (Tyr's Fall)|Flesh Spawn]] slain (6)
*Rally the [[Iron Vrykul (Tyr's Fall)|Iron Vrykul]]

The player controls Keeper Tyr, wielding [[The Silver Hand (artifact)|the Silver Hand]], in the Eastern Glades map and has access to the following abilities:
#{{Abilities|Deliverance|id=399291|Lash out at your enemies, dealing  Radiant damage to all enemies within 25 yd in front of Tyr.|icon=inv_mace_2h_artifactsilverhand_d_01}}
#{{Abilities|Truthguard|id=399295|Unleash your might, striking all enemies up to 30 yards in front of you for significant Holy damage.|icon=inv_shield_1h_artifactnorgannon_d_01}}
#{{Abilities|Light of Tyr|id=399294|Rally the vrykul with the full might of the titans, healing them fully.|icon=spell_paladin_holyprism}}

In addition, Tyr has a permanent buff:
:{{Abilities|Titan Keeper's Righteousness|id=405761|Damage, movement speed, and health regeneration are all greatly increased.|icon=spell_holy_sealoffury}}

Should Tyr's health get low, he automatically heals to full:
:{{Abilities|Might of the Titans|id=406120|Restore Tyr to maximum health.|icon=spell_holy_surgeoflight}}

:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|Activating the Silver Scale transported us into Tyr's memories. But I do not know this memory... or this place.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|I do... This... this is Tirisfal. Could it be? This must be his legendary battle with Zakajz... Tyr's final battle--his noble sacrifice.}}

Defeat the spawn and use Light of Tyr to rally nearby vrykul.

===Stage 2 – Now Kith'ix===
:Defeat forces of the [[Old God]]s in these woods and rally the vrykul.
*Old God forces defeated (0/100%)

:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|Get to safety, my loyal vrykul. I will hold them off.}}

Continue fighting the spawn (3%) as well as [[Faceless Devourer (Tyr's Fall)|Faceless Devourers]] (12%) and [[Faceless Subjugator (Tyr's Fall)|Faceless Subjugators]].

===Stage 3 – Allied Chronicles===
[[File:Tyr's Fall - Kith'ix.jpg|thumb|Archaedas and Ironaya fighting Kith'ix.]]
:Help [[Ironaya]] and [[Archaedas]] defeat Kith'ix.
*[[Kith'ix]] defeated

Kith'ix spawns and fights Ironaya and Archaedas in the center of the forest (in the same spot as the mushroom ring in the present-day [[Whispering Forest]]). Upon being brought to 1% health, Kith'ix runs off to the west and despawns.

===Stage 4 – Umbral Glade===
[[File:Tyr's Fall - Faceless vs vrykul.jpg|thumb|Faceless Subjugators and Corruptor Tentacles keeping Iron Vrykul stunned.]]
:Clear the woods of any remaining Old God forces and rally the vrykul.
*Old God forces defeated (0/100%)

:{{Text|say|Ironaya|These horrors are too many and too strong. We will proceed as one and aid you against Zakajz.}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|No. Protect the vrykul. I will deal with Zakajz.}}
:{{Text|say|Archaedas|We will await your return.}}
:''Ironaya and Archaedas leave.''

:{{Text|say|Travard|Ironaya and Archaedas made their way south to Uldaman after this. Tyr... never made it.}}
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|Uldaman... it is now a place great sorrow. Archaedas and Ironaya waited a long time... and we lost Tyr's memory disc there.}}
:{{Text|say|Travard|It will be no longer if we accomplish our goal and bring back Tyr.}}

Continue defeating the enemies and rallying the vrykul. New enemies include [[Corruptor Tentacle (Tyr's Fall)|Corruptor Tentacles]], a [[Horrific Aberration (Tyr's Fall)|Horrific Aberration]], and [[Mordoth the Hunter|Mordoth]], while new vrykul are a group of [[Battleworn Vrykul]] fighting Mordoth. If Mordoth is brought to 1% health, he teleports away in a burst of Void energy.

;Attacking Mordoth
:{{Text|say|Travard|That's the fiend that attacked my order! So... it was after Tyr all this time?}}

===Stage 5 – Tyr's Last Stand===
[[File:Tyr's Fall - Zakajz.jpg|thumb|Zakajz.]]
[[File:Tyr's Fall - Tyr's Last Stand.jpg|thumb|Tyr confronting Zakajz.]]
:Confront Zakajz.
*Approach Zakajz

Zakajz waits in the northwest by the shore of the lake. When the player gets close, numerous Iron Vrykul run up to cover his flanks.

:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|I am here, Zakajz. Stop this.}}
:{{Text|say|Zakajz|Ah, my pursuit from [[Ulduar]] is at an end. If I had known a few dead vrykul was all it took to get your attention...}}
:{{Text|say|Zakajz|I would have killed them all!}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|That I would not allow. The vrykul stand at my side. They are not like your kind... Kith'ix has abandoned you.}}
:{{Text|say|Zakajz|My kind? Ha ha ha! Order does not protect against betrayal. The vrykul may stand with you...}}

===Stage 6 – The Aspects of Zakajz===
:Defeat Zakajz's illusions.
*Illusion of [[Neltharion (Tyr's Fall)|Neltharion]] defeated
*Illusion of [[Malygos (Tyr's Fall)|Malygos]] defeated
*Illusion of [[Ysera (Tyr's Fall)|Ysera]] defeated
*Illusion of [[Nozdormu (Tyr's Fall)|Nozdormu]] defeated

:{{Text|say|Zakajz|But what of your [[dragon]] pets, [[Dragon Aspects|the Aspects]]? They will betray you Tyr. All of them. Would you like to see?}}

Zakajz retreats slightly north to the edge of the lake. First duo is Malygos (who teleports in) and Neltharion (who flies in).

:{{Text|say|Malygos|[[Magic]]... it is not for small-minded mortals!}}
:{{Text|say|Neltharion|The Old Gods... We will all succumb to their will in the end.}}

Defeat them, and Nozdormu (who teleports in) and Ysera (who flies in) attack.

:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|My failure is... inevitable. [[Murozond]] is inevitable.}}
:{{Text|say|Ysera|I will die... and [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]] itself will become [[Emerald Nightmare|corrupted]].}}

The illusion initially appear normally, but at 75% health they become corrupted. Get them to around 50% health to force them to disappear in a burst of Void energy.

===Final Stage – Tyr's Fall===
[[File:Tyr's Fall - Alexstrasza.jpg|thumb|Zakajz in the form of Alexstrasza.]]
:Defeat Zakajz. Witness Tyr's final sacrifice.
*Zakajz defeated

Zakajz transforms into an illusion of [[Alexstrasza]] and attacks.

:{{Text|say|Zakajz|Even me, the beating heart of the Aspects, will betray you, Tyr.}}
:{{Text|say|Watcher Koranos|Will Alexstrasza become corrupted like the others? How?}}
:{{Text|emote|<laughs maniacally>}}

Get Zakajz to 50%:
:{{text|say|Keeper Tyr|Enough! Your games end here, Zakajz!}}
:{{Text|emote|Tyr steels himself for a final attack.}}

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cinematic]] starts:
{{#ev:youtube|TbqFODs9qdw}}
:''Zakajz knocks Tyr back, forcing him into a kneeling position, and entraps him in Void energy.''
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|<laughs>}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|You are broken, Tyr.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|You have failed, and your vrykul will perish.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Corruption will claim you all...}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|...even your precious Aspects.}}
:{{Text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|<laughs maniacally>}}
:''Zakazj resumes his true form and starts channeling a massive Void spell above him.''
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|Perhaps you will be proved right.}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|That mortals are weak and destined to fall into darkness.}}
:''Tyr glances at the Iron Vrykul around him, then gathers holy magic in his [[Silver hand|left hand]] and unleashes it to free himself and interrupt Zakajz's spell.
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|Yet the courage of the Aspects, and the promise of the mortals, fills me with hope.}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|Hope that they will carry on the titans' legacy.}}
:{{Text|say|Keeper Tyr|So if by the destruction of this body you are purged from [[Azeroth|this world]]... so be it.}}
:''Tyr charges up himself and the Silver Hand with holy energy, then launches himself at Zakajz, sending them both flying into the lake.''
:{{Text|say|Zakajz the Corruptor|<screams in pain>}}
:''Some of the Iron Vrykul run up to the edge to watch but then quickly run away as an immense explosion of energy rocks the lake and causes the screen to fade to white.''
