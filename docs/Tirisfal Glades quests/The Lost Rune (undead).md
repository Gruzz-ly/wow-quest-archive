==Objectives==
Find the rune hidden in [[Night Web's Hollow]] and use it to learn a new technique, then report back to [[Dannal Stern]] in [[Deathknell]].
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Victory Rush (warrior rune)]]

==Description==
The [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]]'s [[warrior]]s have much to teach you, but you must also seek out new techniques on your own.

Another warrior recently ventured north into Night Web's Hollow. He was experimenting with engraving mystical runes onto his equipment to improve his combat prowess.

I suspect he was overwhelmed by the [[spider]]s infesting the mine. Find the rune among their webs and learn this technique yourself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
*[[Tarnished Chain Gloves]]

==Progress==
Did you find the rune?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Applying the rune to your equipment will grant you powerful new abilities.

There are many such runes throughout [[Azeroth]]. Seek them out, as they will help along your journey.
