==Notes==
;Which weapon should we pursue first?
;Holy
:The [[Draenei]] had to flee from many worlds as the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] chased after them across the heavens. It is upon one of these worlds where a valiant few remained with the radiant jewel of healing, T'uure, to face the Legion and allow their friends to escape.

:A rumor is spreading that a soldier in [[Dalaran]] has seen the lost crystal in possession of the Legion. If this is true it must be retrieved!

:[[T'uure, Beacon of the Naaru]]

:(Select)

;Shadow
:An ancient dagger of the [[Old Gods]] has resurfaced in a bid to restore the [[Twilight's Hammer]] to power. They are performing an unholy ritual nearby that must be stopped.

:The Blade of the Black Empire is a powerful [[void]]-attuned sacrificial dagger that has been used in horrific rites to the Old Gods since time immemorial. It enhances its owners with powerful shadow energy.

:[[Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire]]

:(Select)

;Discipline
:Obsessed with cleansing [[undead]] from [[Azeroth]], the fanatical [[Scarlet Crusade]] tried to create a second [[Ashbringer]] in the form of a staff. However, due to treachery from within, the ritual failed in a great fiery explosion. The damaged staff's power proved nearly uncontrollable.

:Fearing its destructive power, the elite [[mage|magi]] of the [[Kirin Tor]] hid it away from the hands of men.

:[[Light's Wrath]]

:(Select

;Artifact not-chosen
:I have been watching your exploits, and I think you the right hero for the job!

;Artifact chosen
:Are you sure you wish to pursue this artifact? It may be some time before you are able to seek out the others. (Okay/Cancel)

Upon speaking to Alonsus again, he has different gossip text depending on which artifact was chosen.
*The Beacon is strongly linked to the [[naaru]], having their aid could be exactly what we need to turn the tide! Are you sure? (T'uure)
*I've heard that this Blade dates back to antiquity, even before the [[titan]]s! An excellent choice, unless you are reconsidering. (Xal'atath)
*This staff has great power that can be used for good, if you have the will to control it. It could also immolate you. Are you sure? (Light's Wrath)
:{{Gossip|I would like to review weapons we might pursue.}}
