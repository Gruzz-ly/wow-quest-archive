==Objectives==
Collect 10 Doom Weed.
* [[Doom Weed]] (10)

==Description==
My envoy just delivered me a bushel of [[Gloom Weed|gloom weed]]. Gloom weed! I don't need gloom weed, I need doom weed! You can see the predicament that I'm in, <name>.

I'll make it worth your while to gather what I need. Bring back to me enough doom weed and I'll give you a suitable reward.

It is my understanding that they like to plague the flora near the mass gravesite, to the north of the [[Brill]] graveyard. Hurry and be mindful of the [[gnoll]]s in the area.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||1|75}}
* 150 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
<The apothecary mutters to himself.>

They brought me gloom weed? GLOOM WEED?!

==Completion==
Ah, my doom weed. Excellent!

<Apothecary Jerrod rubs his hands together greedily.>

These will come in quite handy. You've done me, uh, {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||the lady}}, a fine service today, <name>. As promised, here is the reward that you deserve.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Graverobbers]] before heading out.
