==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Shadow Priestess Malia}} in [[Brill]] and participate in the extraction of {{NPC||Devlin Agamand}}.
* Procedure Completed
* [[Devlin's Remains]] (provided)

==Description==
While the [[Frozen Throne]] lies dormant, the grasp that the {{NPC||Lich King}} once held over the [[Scourge]] grows ever-weaker. His grip on a weakling like Devlin Agamand should be weak enough that we can remove it entirely.

Speak with Shadow Priestess Malia in the manor on the east side of town. She will assist you in the procedure.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Devlin's Shirt
|Boots of Brill
|Treads of Brill
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||1|10}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
What did you find out?

==Completion==
Ah, how unfortunate. Perhaps the Scourge's dominion over Devlin's mind remained too strong. Or perhaps our methods are simply not strong enough. It's also possible that Devlin was too simple-minded to comprehend what we were asking him.

== Notes ==
Speak with Malia, who can be found at {{co|62.0|53.0|Tirisfal Glades}} in the building to the east to proceed:
:Are you ready to begin the procedure?
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}
:{{text|say|Shadow Priestess Malia|Very well. Follow me.}}
:''Malia walks up the stairs and stops at a bed upstairs.''
:{{text|say|Shadow Priestess Malia|Now it is time for us to begin.}}
:{{text|yell|Shadow Priestess Malia|Devlin Agamand! Listen to my voice!}}
:{{text|yell|Shadow Priestess Malia|Your mortal remains have been gathered, here in this place where you spent your childhood!}}
:{{text|yell|Shadow Priestess Malia|Resist the Lich King's will, Devlin! Come to us!}}
:''The [[Spirit of Devlin Agamand]] appears.''
:{{text|say|Spirit of Devlin Agamand|What's going on here?}}
:{{text|say|Spirit of Devlin Agamand|Wait, am I... home?}}
:{{text|say|Spirit of Devlin Agamand|You people... what are you doing here? Why are you in my house?}}
:{{text|say|Spirit of Devlin Agamand|[[Nissa Agamand|Mother]]... [[Gregor Agamand|father]]... [[Thurman Agamand|Thurman]]... where are you?}}
:{{text|say|Spirit of Devlin Agamand|No... I remember. My family is dead. And so am I.}}
:{{text|say|Spirit of Devlin Agamand|And my soul.... my soul belongs to the Scourge!}}
:{{text|yell|Spirit of Devlin Agamand|DIE, YOU WRETCHES!}}
:''The Spirit turns into the hostile [[Shadow of Agamand]] and starts attacking. It has a Mind Flay spell but is easily killed.''
:{{text|say|Shadow Priestess Malia|I had better return to my post. You can find me downstairs if you need anything.}}
