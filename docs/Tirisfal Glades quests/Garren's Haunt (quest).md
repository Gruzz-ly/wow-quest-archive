==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Apothecary Jerrod}} at [[Garren's Haunt]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Description==
As you're probably already realizing, the [[Royal Apothecary Society]] is a widespread organization. We take our plague-alchemy seriously. It is our belief that the more agents we have performing experiments, the sooner we will realize our objective.

One of our agents performs his work at a small encampment to the north of here. His name is Jerrod, and he could use an apprentice of your... stature.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||22}}
* 70 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
{{NPC||Junior Apothecary Holland||Holland}}? He's an amateur. You don't need a fancy two-story apothecarium to make plague... you need love. And maybe some good assistants.

Let me show you how plague is REALLY made.
