==Objectives==
Assist [[Sebastian Jurgens|Doctor Jurgens]] with rift opening at either {{C|Tirisfal Glades}} or {{C|Westfall}}
*Demo the technology

==Description==
Join me in this historic experiment and witness the wonders of my invention! I've calculated two locations with suitable geothermic bioflux energy. With manual-auto-locking phasers, I'm ready to send us to the coordinates within compatible regions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Alliance}}+2,322 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]
*{{Alliance}}+101 reputation with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
*{{Horde}}+2,322 reputation with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]
*{{Horde}}+101 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*[[Sun Shades]]
*[[Premonition and Combat Foresight]]

==Completion==
Jurgens has gone missing in the chaos. You see a shimmering wafer within a cylindrical crystal container. Inside are the smashed-up remains of interior workings of the golem. You reach inside, unfasten wires from the housing, and open it.

==Notes==
Sebastian will go to the {{sod|Console}} at the bottom of the oil rig. Use it to teleport to either Tirisfal Glades or Westfall, for Horde or Alliance respectively. Talk to Sebastian Jurgens nearby, or interact with the [[Electromantic Resonance Transducer]] to begin the event.
