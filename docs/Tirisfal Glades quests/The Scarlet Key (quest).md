'''The Scarlet Key''' is a turn-in quest to unlock the pre-{{g|mop}} [[Scarlet Monastery]] wings: [[Scarlet Monastery Graveyard|Graveyard]], [[Scarlet Monastery Library|Library]], [[Scarlet Monastery Armory|Armory]], and [[Scarlet Monastery Cathedral|Cathedral]]. To see the keyring, loot [[The Scarlet Key]] from the [[Loot-Filled Pumpkin]] after defeating the [[Headless Horseman]] during [[Hallow's End]], or acquire one from the [[Auction House]].

For players who have unlocked Scarlet Monastery of Old, the key also is found inside [[Doan's Strongbox]] after defeating [[Arcanist Doan]] in the Library wing, which can then also be traded or sold on the Auction House.<!--tracking quest 77213-->
