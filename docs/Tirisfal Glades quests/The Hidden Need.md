[[File:The Hidden Need - meeting.jpg|thumb|Calia, Derek, and Lilian Voss.]]

==Objectives==
Meet [[Lilian Voss]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]]. 

==Description==
Because of [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]], some members of the [[Horde]] are skeptical of the [[Forsaken]]. We must regain their trust.

We cannot do that without accepting ourselves. So many feel lost, alone... abandoned.

I have arranged a meeting. It could be a big step... or all go horribly wrong. Either way, you should bear witness.

Meet me in Tirisfal Glades, at the [[Calston Estate]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Calia Menethil]] and [[Derek Proudmoore]] have come a long way to speak with us. Let's not keep them waiting any longer.

==Notes==
You do not need to be in the ''[[Battle for Azeroth]]'' version of Tirisfal Glades to complete this quest.

;After completion
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|My lady. Thank you for agreeing to meet with me. I am Lilian Voss.}}
:{{Text|say|Calia Menethil|Miss Voss. I once listened to [[High Priest Benedictus Voss|your father]]'s sermons. That was... long ago. Forgive me, I haven't introduced my companion. This is Lord [[Derek Proudmoore]].}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Lord Proudmoore. You should know that I played a part in the events that led to your [[Undead|undeath]]. I... regret much of what has happened.}}
:{{Text|say|Derek Proudmoore|Did you see what they did to me in that pyramid? How they tortured my mind? Intended to wield me as a weapon against those I love?}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|I did not know... at first. Once I did, I should have stopped it. [[Baine Bloodhoof]] showed the courage I lacked. If I could change the past, I would.}}
:{{Text|say|Calia Menethil|You didn't reach out to offer apologies. Why did you ask us here?}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|This champion witnessed your kindness toward Lord Proudmoore. How you helped him through his torment. Sadly, he is not the only one who suffered in the [[Fourth War|war]].}}
:{{Text|say|Calia Menethil|[[Night elf]] [[sentinels]]? Why are you... By the [[Light]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Many [[Burning of Teldrassil|fell]] at [[Teldrassil]]. Some were raised into rage and darkness, turned against their own people. They, too, have been abandoned.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Delaryn Summermoon]]|[[Death]] is... cold. Even for those who burn.}}
:{{Text|say|Derek Proudmoore|Calia, I know the pain they suffer. The hopelessness. You must do something for them.}}
:{{Text|say|Calia Menethil|We will, Derek. Together.}}
:{{Text|say|Calia Menethil|Greetings. I am Calia Menethil of [[Lordaeron]]. I will do my best to help you. Please, come with us.}}
:''Calia and Derek take their leave, being followed behind by Delaryn, [[Kitala Starshadow]], and [[Dark Ranger (Tirisfal Glades)|some night elven dark rangers]]. They head out taking the road to the west.''
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|That meeting went exactly as I'd hoped. I believe Calia Menethil can help many who are lost.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|We will speak again soon. There is more work to be done.}}

;Objectives
Meet Lilian Voss near the [[Bulwark]].

;Description
It is time for the [[Forsaken]] to regain the trust of the [[Horde]].

We cannot do that without accepting ourselves. So many feel lost, alone... monstrous.

I have arranged a meeting. It could be a big step... or all go horribly wrong. Either way, you will want to see it.

Meet me in [[Tirisfal Glades]], near the Bulwark. We will need your help in the coming days, and the more you know, the better off we will all be.

;Completion
<[[Calia Menethil|Calia]] has behaved with honor at every step, in spite of the [[Before the Storm|horrible betrayal]] she faced at the hands of [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]].

Lilian's machinations are becoming clearer.>
