==Objectives==
Witness the message.
*Message seen

==Description==
<[[Dori'thur]] hovers silently, peering at you with keen, expectant eyes.

With a taloned foot, the noble [[owl]] offers you an imbued crystal. Within that crystal, you sense a message.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}

==Completion==
<Dori'thur blinks knowingly.>

==Notes==
Dori'thur will either spawn in either the [[Ruins of Lordaeron]] for Forsaken loyalists, or [[Orgrimmar]] for non-Forsaken loyalists, after the Forsaken heritage quest [[I Am Forsaken (quest)]] has been completed by any character in the [[Warband]].

The following dialogue is triggered by the quest:
:{{Text|say|[[Sylvanas Windrunner]]|Greetings, my most loyal ally. I speak to you now from beyond the veil of [[Death]].}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Here, in this place of eternal darkness, my work--my penance--continues.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Though the [[Maw]] is an unlikely place for one to find peace, each [[soul]] I rescue helps mine feel a little more... whole.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|As I ponder my deeds since being raised into [[undeath]], I have many regrets. Things said and choices made that I wish could be taken back.}}
:{{Race|Forsaken|notext}} {{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|But there is one thing for which I will always be proud: helping the [[Forsaken]] find their place in a world that shunned them.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|My time to lead may be over, but I will always stand with you against those who would cast you out and call you monsters.}}
:{{Race|Forsaken|notext}} {{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Under the leadership of the [[Desolate Council]], a new group of voices has arisen to represent all Forsaken.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Stand proud in the [[Horde]]. Know that all of you were so much more than arrows in my quiver.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|As much as the family I was born into, you will always be my people. And one day, I do hope to walk among you once again.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|I must go. There are many more souls yet to be freed... among them, [[Nathanos Blightcaller|one]] that is most dear to me.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Shorel'aran, my friend.}}
