==Objectives==
Slay 3 Scarlet Zealots and 4 Scarlet Friars.
* [[Scarlet Zealot]] slain (3)
* [[Scarlet Friar]] slain (4)

==Description==
Though the strength of the [[Scarlet Crusade]] wanes, we are still at war. The report {{NPC||Executor Arren}} sent me indicates Scarlet Crusaders have been raiding from the ruined tower in southeastern [[Tirisfal Glades|Tirisfal]] near the [[Balnir Farmstead]] under the command of {{NPC||Captain Vachon}}.

Kill 3 of his zealots and 4 of his friars. It should prove to be a devastating blow to the Crusade!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3}}
* 775 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
I see you have returned but your task is not complete. Perhaps you are at ease with the mere humans interfering with {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||The Dark Lady's}} plan? Or perhaps you can heed the call of duty and slay the Scarlet band that lies only moments away!

==Completion==
Your actions will slow down the Scarlet Crusade's advancement in Tirisfal quite a bit... hopefully for good. But other threats loom.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Grisly Grizzlies]] before heading out.

Head northeast from the [[Bulwark]] toward the [[Balnir Farmstead]] killing {{NPC||Plagued Bruin}}s along the way. Take out the Scarlets just north of the farm at the [[Crusader Outpost]], then circle around back to the Bulwark, killing more bruins. More bears can be found west of the farm if necessary.

==Progression==
