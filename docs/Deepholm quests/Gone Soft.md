== Objectives ==
Kill 8 Fungal Behemoths.
*[[Fungal Behemoth]] slain x8

== Description ==
The [[fungal giant|fungal behemoths]] that surround us have succumbed to a weakness very samiliar to that that [[Curse of Flesh|affects your kind]]. Their skin has grown soft. They no longer belong with the stone.

Kill them. We do not wish to see this infection spread.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Spore-Soaked Leggings|Girdle of Bolete Explosion|Cloak of Fungal Growth}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
We have escaped the curse of flesh for this long; I will not see my brothers fall to such weakness now.

== Completion ==
You carry with you a certain degree of potency. I can find some respect for such strength, especially in your kind.

My concerns are not yet abated. Not for the source of the overgrowth, and not for you.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Doomshrooms]] and [[Familiar Intruders]] before heading out. Go north, killing. Complete the Familiar Intruders chain (all of three quests) to resume with [[Shaken and Stirred]] and [[Corruption Destruction]].
