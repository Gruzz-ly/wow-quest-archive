*[[Mor'norokk the Hateful]] subdued

== Description ==
It's not too late, <name>. The [[Twilight's Hammer|cultists]] are probably still here.

Go below decks, finds out who's in charge and subdue them.

We will obtain answers to our questions, one way or another.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

Hail, <name>.

== Completion ==
Oi, this was a heavy one! He nearly broke {{NPC||Stormbeak||me gryphon's}} back!

Are you ready to interrogate the ogre, <name>?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Take No Prisoners]] before heading below decks. Moronokk is astern, just below deck. Open up, don't worry about killing him as he can't die. Get him below 30% and he'll turn friendly:
:{{text|say|Mor'norokk the Hateful|Ok, ok, I give up. I'll tell you everything!}}
:''Walk up to him.''
:{{text|say|Mor'norokk the Hateful|Gotcha!}}
:''Mor'norokk snags the player and jumps to the bomb bay doors, holding the player over open space.''
:{{text|say|Mor'norokk the Hateful|I hope you can fly, pipsqueak!}}
: ''Mylra flys Stormbeak up through the bay doors behind Mor'norokk.''
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|Over here, you ugly whale!}}
:''Mylra throws a chain, hooked to Stormbeak, at Mor'norokk and drags him off the beam he's standing on, releasing the player.''
:{{text|yell|Mor'norokk the Hateful|You! Let me go now! Wait... no! Don't let go!}}
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|Meet me back up top. This two-headed freak has a few questions to answer!}}
: ''Mylra exits the way she came.''
