==Objectives==
Collect the Masters' Gate Plans.
*[[Masters' Gate Plans]]

==Description==
We came here to investigate rumors of a [[Titan]] artifact up at the [[Masters' Gate]] to the southwest.

One of those [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists must have the plans for what they're doing up there. You're going to have to get them for us, <name>.

Kill cultists at the Masters' Gate until you find them.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}} (or {{cost|16|53}} at max level)

==Progress==
Those plans are the key to everything.

==Completion==
<The examiner takes a look at the plans that you hand to him.>

This is just gibberish!

What does this even say? What language is that?

==Progression==
{{To Uldum!}}
