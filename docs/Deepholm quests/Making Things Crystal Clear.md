== Objectives ==
Collect 8 Chalky Crystal Formations.
*[[Chalky Crystal Formation]] x8

== Description ==
Among the [[Shuddering Spires]] are crystals. White, chalky crystals. We can absorb these crystals into our skin. To cleanse us. Purify us.

I do not stride among the stones any longer. This carries many boons, but I can no longer retrieve the crystals for myself. Bring me the crystals that I might be stronger. Carry them away from the flayers. Away from my Sons. This honor should be mine.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Have you done this favor that I asked of you? Did you bring the crystals?

== Completion ==
Ahh... invigorating. Thank you, fleshling.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Intervention]] and [[Putting the Pieces Together]] before heading out. Japsertip Borers, Ravagers and Swarmers all count. Swarmers come in packs of five, watch out! There are also crystal formation objects on the ground. The spires cover a very large area, so don't stick too close to the quest givers. While out and about, a {{NPC||Pebble}} should have attached itself to the player. After completing these three, it offers [[Clingy]].
