== Objectives ==
{{Questportrait|image=Haethen Kaul.jpg|name=Haethen Kaul|text=First, get the fire, water, and air wards. Then slay him!}}
Acquire the Fire, Water, and Air Wards, and then slay Haethen Kaul.
*Fire Ward acquired
*Water Ward acquired
*Air Ward acquired
*[[Haethen Kaul]] slain

== Description ==
Did ya hear the blatherin' idiot while ye were [[Twilight Terrace|up there]]? That's none other than Haethen Kaul, their leader.

The man's gone daft with power. He's pullin' it straight from them bound [[elemental]]s, makin' him nigh invincible.

The only thing I can think of to get ye into a proper shape fer a fight with him is fer ye to first kill all o' them elementals, gettin' their wards. That should protect ye from Haethen's spells.

Well, most o' them anyway.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Wardfire Shoulders|Kaulslayer Grips|Helm of Silenced Blathering}}
You will also receive: {{cost|17|20}}

== Progress ==
Yer gonna have to do better than that, <laddie/missy>!

Now get back up there an' finish the job or do I have ta go an' do it myself?

== Completion ==
That's the ol' spirit! One less nasty in this world that the little ones will have ta worry about when they go ta sleep at night.

Not ta mention that we won't have ta be worring about him none no more neither!

Now let's see here. I think we have somethin' in our crates that'll make a fittin' reward fer ya.

== Notes ==
*Pick up [[Decryption Made Easy]] before heading out, as the quest is done in the same area.
*The three orbs disappaer when zoning out of [[Deepholm]].
