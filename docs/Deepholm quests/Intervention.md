== Objectives ==
Kill 12 Jaspertip rockflayers.
*Japsertip flayers slain x12

== Description ==
The [[rock flayer|flayers]] have gone crazy with hunger. Their digging was once tempered and mediate. Now their hunger cannot be quenched. They grow murderously violent.

The flayers have turned on my {{NPC||Son of Kor||Sons}}. They overwhelm them. Kill them. It must stop.

Kill the flayers. They serve no purpose to the earth. Their passing will not be missed. Save my sons. Slaughter any flayers you find.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
I do not know why the flayers hunger so. Many things have changed since the rift opened between our worlds.

== Completion ==
You've proven useful, <race>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Making Things Crystal Clear]] and [[Putting the Pieces Together]] before heading out. Japsertip Borers, Ravagers and Swarmers all count. Swarmers come in packs of five, watch out! The spires cover a very large area, so don't stick too close to the quest givers. While out and about, a {{NPC||Pebble}} should have attached itself to the player. After completing these three, it offers [[Clingy]].
