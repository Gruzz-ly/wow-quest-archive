==Objectives==
Go to the [[Alabaster Shelf]] and smash [[Diaminium Pillar]]s. Collect 60 Diaminium.

* [[Diaminium]] (60)

==Description==
Most of the materials we'll need can be found right down here in the [[Deepholm]].

We just need ta be discreet about it. If old [[Therazane]] catches wind of what we're up to, she might try ta put a stop ta it.

But let's not worry 'bout that. The first thing you'll need is diaminium. There are pillars that grow in the Alabaster Shelf rich with 'em.

Just use yer old blacksmithin' hammer and smash those pillars ta bits. Don't worry about breaking the diaminium. We'll meld it all back tagether.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This'll be fun! I haven't made one of those anvils in ages!

==Completion==
Oh, did the drakes hear you smashing? Ha ha! Yea, I suppose that'd get their attention.

Still though, this'll be plenty of diaminium.

==Notes==
Fly due south from Ormhun Stonehammer until you reach the Alabaster Shelf. Look around for a short, narrow pillar on the ground and smash it, then pick up the [[Diaminium Fragment]]s. Smashing a pillar will agitate a nearby [[Stonescale Drake]], so be prepared to fight.

==Progression==
