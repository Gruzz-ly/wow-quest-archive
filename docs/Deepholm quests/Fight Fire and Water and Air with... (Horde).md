==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|image=Haethen Kaul.jpg|name=Haethen Kaul|text=First, get the fire, water, and air wards. Then slay him!}}
Acquire the Fire, Water, and Air Wards, and then slay Haethen Kaul.
*Fire Ward acquired
*Water Ward acquired
*Air Ward acquired
*[[Haethen Kaul]] slain

==Description==
Did you hear the man going on with his incessant yelling while you were up there? That's Haethen Kaul, their leader.

It's a well known fact that he's gone insane from the power he's drawing from their bound elementals. Unfortunately, it makes him nigh invincible.

If you're to fight him, you'll first have to kill each of the elementals, gaining their wards in the process. That should protect you from Haethen's magic.

Well, most of it anyway.

==Rewards==
You will also receive: {{cost|17|20|}}
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bondshatter Shoulders	
|Silencer's Gauntlets
|Tonguecarver Greathelm
}}

==Progress==
Have you not managed to gain the elemental wards and defeat Haethen Kaul yet?

==Completion==
An excellent display of <class> prowess.

I believe that a reward is in order. Something appropriate for a <powerful man/lovely lady> such as yourself.

==Notes==
*Pick up [[Decryption Made Easy]] before heading out, as the quest is done in the same area.
*The three orbs disappaer when zoning out of [[Deepholm]].

==Progression==
{{To Uldum!}}

==Patch changes==
