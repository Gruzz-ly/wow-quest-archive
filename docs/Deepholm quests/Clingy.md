== Objectives ==
Bring {{NPC||Pebble}} to the large crystal formation in the [[Shuddering Spires]].
*Pebble brought to crystal formation

== Description ==
<A miniscule [[elemental]] seems to have taken a liking to you.>

Caris... carstr... crystal? <Pebble looks up at you expectantly.>

<You did notice a very large crystal formation towards the middle of the Shuddering Spires. Perhaps you should take him there?>

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Bracers of the Energetic Elemental|Geodecrack Shoulderguards|Crystalmuncher Necklace}}

== Progress ==
<Pebble looks up at you expectantly.>

== Completion ==
<The stones in Pebble's body bounce up and down happily. He seems very appreciative.>

== Notes ==
While out and about on the previous quests:
:{{text|emote|You hear the sound of shuffling stones behind you.}}
This is the sign that Pebble has attached itself to the player. Complete the previous three quests and Pebble will offer this quest. Fly southwest to the large green crystal formation. Get close, land, and Pebble will charge in! Make sure there aren't any full-size [[rock flayer]]s nearby, as a cadre of weak, low-health {{NPC||Jaspertip Crystal-gorger}}s will spawn, jumping the player and Pebble. Keep them off of Pebble until it finishes charging up.
:{{text|emote|Pebble sees the crystals ahead and excitedly rushes towards them!}}
:{{text|emote|Pebble bobbles around appreciatively.}}
