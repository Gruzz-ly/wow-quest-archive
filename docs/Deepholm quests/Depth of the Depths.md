== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Diamant the Patient.jpg||Diamant the Patient. The Timeless. The Long-Winded.}}
Find the Painite within the [[Crumbling Depths]].

== Description ==
<The ground trembles slightly, and the low, familiar voice of {{NPC||Diamant the Patient||Diamant}} speaks as if from the stone itself.>

Well done, <race>.

Within the tunnels below, you will find the stone which you seek. Painite.

The dangers ahead are many...

Dangers that the [[Stone Lords]] themselves fear.

Remain steady.

Remain strong.

The strength of the rock itself is beneath your feet.

== Completion ==
<This is it. This is the stone Diamant sent you for.>

== Notes ==
Hop on a land mount and run in. Ware the Colossal Gyreworm!

Head east. The cluster is at the easternmost big room in the cave complex.
