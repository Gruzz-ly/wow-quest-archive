== Objectives ==
Retrieve 8 bags of Verlok Miracle-grow.
*[[Verlok Miracle-Grow]] x8

== Description ==
If this [[Crimson Expanse|disgusting growth]] is truly brought on by the [[Verlok]], then their supplies will be in their village to the north. Bring them to me so that I can verify your claims.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
I await your proof, <race>...

== Completion ==
So your words prove true. You have my gratitude, <race>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Shaken and Stirred]] before heading out. Fly north. Up at Verlok Village is {{NPC||Ruberick}}, who offers a side quest, [[Wrath of the Fungalmancer]]. All along the ground (and not up on top of the pillars) are bags of Miracle-Grow. Go looting.
