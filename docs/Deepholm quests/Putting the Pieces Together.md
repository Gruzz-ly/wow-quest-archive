== Objectives ==
Aid 6 {{NPC||Dormant Stonebound Elemental}}s in reforming.
*Stonebound Elementals reformed x6

== Description ==
<Race>, if you act in the service of the [[Stone Lords]], there are those that might aid you.

Watch for the Stonebound. They lie dormant, all around the Shuddering Spires. It should not take much prompting to rebind them to service against the [[rock flayer|flayers]].

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
<Berracite grumbles, and you feel the reverberations gradually roll by under your feet.>

== Completion ==
Thank you, <race>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Intervention]] and [[Making Things Crystal Clear]] before heading out. Look for dead earth elementals and right-click them. The spires cover a very large area, so don't stick too close to the quest givers. While out and about, a {{NPC||Pebble}} should have attached itself to the player. After completing these three, it offers [[Clingy]].
