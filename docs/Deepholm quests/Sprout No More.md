== Objectives ==
Interact with and gain a War Guardian, and destroy 5 Giant Mushrooms.
*Obtain a [[War Guardian (Deepholm)|War Guardian]]
*[[Giant Mushroom]]s destroyed x5

== Description ==
The [[stone trogg]] [[Needlerock Mystic|mystics]] are creating those [[Fungal Monstrosity|fungal monstrosities]] from the giant mushrooms to the north.

I want you to take a war guardian to help deal with the [[fungal giant|giants]] and [[stone trogg]]s. Make your way to the giant mushrooms and target them. I and my geomancers will sink them into the ground before the mystics have a chance to finish their ritual.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Don't forget to use the war guardian to help you. The [[Needlerock Chasm|chasm]] is teeming with mystics and fungal monstrosities.

== Completion ==
They won't have any more of those fungal giants to throw at us!

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Fungal Monstrosities]] before heading out. Click on a War Guardian to pick it up as a minion with 107,000 health. Fly out, close to the ground, and right-click on mushrooms to destroy them.
