== Objectives ==
Kill 8 Verlok Pillartumblers in the lower section of [[Verlok Village]].
*[[Verlok Pillartumbler]] slain x8

== Description ==
I have sent my brothers to assault the [[Verlok]] village from below. The Verlok will gather on their rocky ledges, as they always do to avoid our ire. When they do, we shall make the earth itself shake them until they fall at our feet blow.

That is where you prove your use. When they fall to the ground amongst my brothers, make sure that they do not rise again.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Strangely, your size and resourcefulness are starting to prove quite useful.

== Completion ==
Well done, fleshling. Your presence complimented by brothers well.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Corruption Destruction]] before heading out. Fly north. Up at Verlok Village is {{NPC||Ruberick}}, who offers a side quest, [[Wrath of the Fungalmancer]]. Raging Crystal-walkers are shaking the living daylights out of the pillars on which Verlock Village reside, knocking Verlok Pillartumblers loose. The fall stuns them for a few seconds and also knocks off a random chunk of their health (either a little or a lot). Take advantage of the stun and unload right as they fall to get in some free hits without counter. The stun only lasts for a few seconds and they start regenerating health the second they land, so tag them before the stun wears off or they will run back to the pillar and disappear.
