==Objectives==
Find Pebble within the [[Crumbling Depths]] and lead him safely out of the tunnels.
*[[Pebble]] brought to safety.

==Description==
Pebble has gotten himself lost again, somewhere deep in the Crumbling Depths.

He's fortunate that his size makes him unworthy of the effort for those [[gyreworm]]s, but it's only a matter of time before he stumbles too close to one and gets eaten. Whatever he's so intent on down there is certainly not worth it.

He seems to like you. Please, go and find him and bring him out of those tunnels to safer playing grounds.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}} (or {{cost|10|46}} at max level)

==Progress==
Pebble is much smarter than he lets on, but he is spoiled. I fear one day he may suffer for it.

==Completion==
You've done well. Now that these are rocklings are free to learn our ways, they will grow tall and strong.

One day, we will extinguish the gyreworm infestation from our realm, and these rocklings shall no longer be plagued in their youth. 

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fear of Boring]] and [[Motes]] before heading out.

Pebble can be found at the north end of the large central room of the depths at {{co|63.1|20.9|Deepholm}} on a ledge only accessible from circling around. Interact with him:
:Pebble bounces around and looks up at you hopefully. He definitely remembers you.
{{gossip|''Come little guy. Let's get out of here.''}}
:{{text|emote|Pebble's stones jitter as he obediently falls in beside you.}}
Head south, through the circular room where the Colossal Gyreworm is circling, killing hapless adventurers, and exit the depths. Reach the mouth of the cave and...
:{{text|emote|Pebble shuffles around happily and disappears in to the distance.}}

Complete this quest 10 times to get the achievement [[Rock Lover]], and earn yourself [[Pebble (companion)]].
