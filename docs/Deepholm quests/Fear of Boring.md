==Objectives==
Kill 10 gyreworms.
* [[Gyreworm]] slain x10

==Description==
The gyreworms infest the rock, eating away at it until our home will one day collapse. For every one that is killed, twice as many burst forth to follow, but we must carry on the fight. They must be extinguished.

Go to the Crumbling Depths and slaughter any worms that you can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60|}} (or {{cost|10|46|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Your flesh is well suited for the task. It does not corrode from their attacks as our rockskin does.

==Completion==
You wage a war that we cannot. Thank you for your help.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Motes]] before heading out.

Do this quest while working on [[Beneath the Surface]], as to get to the objective for that quest, you'll need to kill Gyreworms.
