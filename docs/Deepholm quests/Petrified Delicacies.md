== Objectives ==
Gather 12 Petrified Stone Bats for {{NPC||Pebble}}.
*[[Petrified Stone Bat (item)]] x12

== Description ==
Petrified [[bat]]s.

[[Elemental]]s of that size are picky. You're not likely to find anything better easily.

To the east are [[basilisk]]s. They petrify bats that fly too close and snack on them when they grow hungry. You may find bats scattered around their territory.

I must warn you... if you show that little elemental too much attention, you're unlikely to be rid of it. It can be very... needy.

== Progress ==
<Pebble starts to look up at you, eyes glowing faintly, growing rounder and larger every moment.>

== Completion ==
<Pebble looks upon the pile of petrified bats and rolls around in them, seeming to forget that you exist entirely. Perhaps for the best, if Kor's warnings are to be trusted.>

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Rock Bottom]] before heading out.

On complete:
