==Objectives==
Use Mylra's Knife to obtain 5 Sides of Basilisk Meat from dead [[Jadecrest Basilisk]]s.
*[[Side of Basilisk Meat]] x5
*[[Mylra's Knife]] (provided)

==Description==
We're only going to get one shot at capturing [[Abyssion]], <name>. Let's make it count.

We'll test out the trap on the biggest of the [[stone dragon]]s on the [[Alabaster Shelf]].

To lure the stone matriarch, we're going to need to gather sufficient bait.

Take this knife and carve 5 sides of [[basilisk]] meat. That ought to be enough even for her appetite.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

==Progress==
Did you obtain the meat?

==Completion==
That should be enough to lure the beast, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[To Catch a Dragon]] before heading out. Head west to the shelf and start killing basilisk. Loot them, then use the knife to carve them up.
