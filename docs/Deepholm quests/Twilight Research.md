== Objectives ==
Obtain 4 Twilight Research Notes from {{NPC||Mercurial Ooze}}s in the [[Upper Silvermarsh]].
*[[Twilight Research Notes]] x4

== Description ==
The book you found apepars to detail some form of research carried out by a member of the [[Twilight's Hammer]].

It deals with the [[ooze]]s in some way, but there are multiple pages missing.

Perhaps if you found additional notes you might be able to make sense of it.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
<You scroll through the notes, trying to put them in order.>

== Completion ==
The notes deal with {{NPC||Maziel||High Cultist Maziel}}'s research on the elemental properties of quicksilver.

His obsession with the subject borders on the insane.

== Notes ==
While looking for crates for [[Quicksilver Submersion]], kill a trogg to find [[Maziel's Research]], which starts this quest. Oozes drop notes. Troggs don't drop crates, though. They're objects found at the edge of a mercury pool. Loot four notes to complete the quest automatically and start [[Maziel's Revelation]] next.
