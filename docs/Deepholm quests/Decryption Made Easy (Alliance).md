==Objectives==
Decrypt 6 plans.
*Plans decrypted x6
*[[Encrypted Plans]] (provided)

==Description==
We don't have the tools to decipher these encrypted plans. The [[Twilight's Hammer]] do, though.

Would you be a sweetie and take the plans back [[Masters' Gate|up there]] and run them through their one-time decryption engines?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

==Completion==
Ah ha! So, that's it! They're planning on invading [[Uldum]].

What's worse is that [[Forge of Origination|the pyramid]] inside the [[Maker's Rise]] at Uldum can be reconfigured to become a weapon. A weapon that is capable of destroying all life on [[Azeroth]]!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fight Fire and Water and Air with...]] before heading out. There are twilight devices all over the terrace. Interact with six to automatically complete the quest.

On complete:
:{{text|yell|There is an intruder amongst us. Destroy them! Nothing must interfere with Lord Deathwing's plan!}}

==Progression==
{{To Uldum!}}
