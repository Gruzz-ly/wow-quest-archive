== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Therazane}} on the [[Halcyon Egress]].

== Description ==
Sadly, I must stay and hold the rift, so you will have to battle without me. Go now to Therazane and join the battle, as promised.

When our part of the bargain is fulfilled, bring the last piece of the [[World Pillar]] here as quickly as possible.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|2|15}}

== Completion ==
And so you arrive, fleshling. As promised.

== Notes ==
Fly northeast, just to the southeast of Therazane's Throne. The Halycon Egress is just to the north of the Twilight Precipice.

==Progression==
