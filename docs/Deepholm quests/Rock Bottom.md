Kill Gorgonite.
*[[Gorgonite]] slain

== Description ==
I've one more favor to ask, fleshling.

There is a [[basilisk]], much larger and much older than the rest. Though we fear nothing from their kind, this one has become so potent as to petrify some of my sons. This shall not be abided.

Find Gorgonite to the east and slay him. He has lived much longer than necessary.

Rough times, these...

== Completion ==
Thank you, <race>. You've done all that I can ask of you. I shall impart my favor for you to the {{NPC||Therazane||Stonemother}}.

May the stone beneath your feet hold you steady during your quest for the [[World Pillar]].

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Petrified Delicacies]] before heading out. Fly to the east-northeast. 

Gorgonite is a level 83 basilisk with 134,000 health. However, a [[Son of Kor]] is there to assist. Dodge the thrown boulders!
