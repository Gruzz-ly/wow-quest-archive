==Objectives==
Escort 5 [[Opalescent Guardian]]s to [[Aeosera]].
* Opalescent Guardians Rebuilt (5)
* Guardians Escorted to Aeosera (5)

==Description==
I confess the [[stone drake]] broodmother and I have had a rocky relationship in the past. She supported [[Deathwing]] during the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]], you know. But [[Aeosera]] has been put back in her place and it is my responsibility to protect her.

The problem is that she refuses to abandon her eggs, even in the midst of a [[trogg]] attack.

You're a [[shaman]]! Use your natural magnetism to reassemble fallen Opalescent Guardians in the [[Pale Roost]]. Escort them to Aeosera so they can carry her eggs to safety of my bosom.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Step to it, shaman! Reassemble those guardians and take them to Aeosera!

==Completion==
How delightful! Aeosera is very pleased with you, shaman. As am [[Therazane|I]].

Now then, it's time to find [[Doomhammer|that artifact of yours]]. Thanks to your efforts, the [[stone drake]]s will help us.

==Notes==
Once the elementals are following you, take them to {{Co|31.36|20.77|Deepholm}} where Aeosara and [[Stone Drake Egg]]s are found.

:{{Text|say|Therazane|Oh how lovely, lovely! The clutch is safe. Join me back at my throne. I know where to find your hammer - and the stone dragons are now free to help.}}
