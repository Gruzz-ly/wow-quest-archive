== Objectives ==
Kill Dragul Giantbutcher and 12 Twilight Cultists at [[Lorthuna's Gate]].
*[[Dragul Giantbutcher]] slain
*Lorthuna's Gate Cultists slain x12

== Description ==
I would apologize for {{NPC||Boden the Imposing||Boden}}, but stone is stubborn.

It does not sway from its ways without the wear of time.

The [[Stone Lords]], Boden and I among them, are charged with retrieving the [[World Pillar]].

In that, we are at odds.

I would extend my patience upon you, <race>.

Prove that you are no ally of the [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight Cult]] or {{NPC||Deathwing}}... Carry our hatred upon them.

Strike swiftly where we cannot.

Succeed and I will listen.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Bloodcult Handwraps|Giantbutcher's Discarded Spaulders|Stonebound Legplates}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Take your time, fleshling.

I am in no hurry.

== Completion ==
I have observed you, <race>.

You do not fear shedding Twilight blood.

In this, I am willing to extend you some degree of trust.

It is a start.

All things in time.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Unsolid Ground]] and [[Loose Stones]] before heading out. Cultists are worth five reputation with [[Therazane (faction)|Therazane]] each. Yay. Dragul is in the stone building near the tower in the north part of the lower camp by the ramp leading to the upper camp.
