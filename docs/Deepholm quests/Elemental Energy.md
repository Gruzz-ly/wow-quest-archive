==Objectives==
Destroy 8 [[Energized Geode]]s or [[Lodestone Elemental]]s near the Depleted Totem.
*Totem Energized x8
*[[Depleted Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
It's taking every ounce of our power to keep this realm stable in the absence of the [[World Pillar]].

As [[shaman]] we can tap directly into the energies of the [[elemental]]s that inhabit [[Deepholm]] and use them to heal the damage that the rift is causing.

Take this totem and place it on the ground outside. Any energized geodes or lodestone elementals destroyed in its proximity will fill it with the energy we require.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Sparklight Robes|Groundshort Leggings|Energon Greatmace}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|20}}

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. We need all the power we can muster to keep Deepholm stable.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Gunship Down]] and [[The Earth Claims All]] before heading out. The shipwreck is southeast of the temple. There are geodes and elementals all along the way.
