== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Catapult Parts.
*[[Catapult Part]] x6

== Description ==
<Clay sneers at you and makes a sound much like two stones rubbing against each other.>

They've smashed all our catapults. I've been trying to get this one working, but no luck so far.

Maybe you'd like to make yourself useful. Head out into [[Fractured Battlefront|the battlefront]] and grab me any spare parts you come across.

You think you can handle that, flesh bag?

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Catapult Loading Scoop|Re-Wound Cogspring|Gear Detector}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
Well? I don't have all day.

== Completion ==
Well then. Maybe you're okay after all.

Alright, alright... don't get bent out of shape. Just give me a few moments with these parts.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Shatter Them!]] and [[Battlefront Triage]] before heading out. The parts are, well, large. Very large. Larger than quest items should be.
