== Objectives ==
Slay 5 Needlerock Mystics.
*[[Needlerock Mystic]] slain x5

== Description ==
The Needlerock mystics have taken control of the [[fungal giant]]s that have sprouted in [[Needlerock Chasm|their chasm]], down below. Now they seek to contol our war constructs.

Go north into [[Needlerock Slag]] and do something about it! Isn't that what you're here for?

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Gloves of Troggslaying|Troggbreaker Shoulderpads|Troggbane Chestguard}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Do I have to go in there and do it myself, <name>?

== Completion ==
A few less [[stone trogg]]s is always a good thing. Glad to see that you're a decent <class> after all.

We'll soon know the exact location where they're keeping my father captive. Hope you survive until then.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Reactivate the Constructs]] before heading out. Fly over the front line, then land when safely past the spawning troggs and fungal giants. Run in and activate a construct, then use it to help kill a trogg. Then repeat.
