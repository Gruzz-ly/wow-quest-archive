==Objectives==
Grant the Stonefather's Boon to 12 Earthen Defenders. 
*Stonefather's Boon granted x2
*[[Stonefather's Banner]] (provided)

==Description==
With the Stonefather taken prisoner, our forces are demoralized. Normally any one of mine could take five times his number of [[stone trogg]]s. But now....

I want you to head out into the field surrounding the town. Plant Stonefather Oremantle's banner near my defenders. Grant them his boon and remind them of that for which they fight. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

==Progress==
Rally more of my troops, <name>.

==Completion==
You have my thanks, <name>. You've made all the difference, and the fate of these cowardly [[Stone Trogg Ambusher|stone trogg ambusher]]s is set in stone.

Now we must get about the business of retaking Stone Hearth.

==Notes==
Pick up [[We're Surrounded]] before heading out.
