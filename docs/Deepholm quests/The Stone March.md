== Objectives ==
Kill 15 Twilight Precipice Cultists.
*Twilight Precipice Cultists slain (15)

== Description ==
My forces have already begun the assault. Join them. Spill the blood of these [[Twilight's Hammer|cultists]] upon the ground, so that {{NPC||Therazane||I}} might feel how they suffer.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Our revenge against the worshippers of {{NPC||Deathwing}} has finally arrived. It is a sweet revenge.

== Completion ==
Their blood upon the earth is a sweet thing. I shall cherish every moment, slowly extinguishing the stragglers from my realm.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Therazane's Mercy]] and [[The Twilight Flight]] before heading out. Go crazy-go-nuts on the cultists. Complete [[The Twilight Flight]] before Therazane will offer the conclusion. Also, Therazane shall yell as killing the Cultists as follows:
*{{text|yell|Therazane|The earth has come to claim you, cult!}}
*{{text|yell|Therazane|Your trespass shall see no forgiveness! Deathwing is no longer here to coddle you!}}
*{{text|yell|Therazane|Cower as the very ground reaches up to swallow you!}}
*{{text|yell|Therazane|Returning has assured your death!}}
Upon completion, Therazane says:

{{text|say|Therazane|Well done! Return to the [[Temple of Earth|temple]], [[Gorsik the Tumultuous|Gorsik]] shall meet you there as promised.}}
