==Objectives==
Speak with [[Slate Quicksand]] at the [[Quaking Fields]] in [[Deepholm]].

==Description==
Before you can help us here, you're going have to deal with [[Therazane]], the Stone Mother's, forces to the south. The [[elemental]]s and [[giant]]s upon the Quaking Fields are being mustered.

They too are after the middle fragment of the [[World Pillar]]. They'll attack us amidst our war with the [[stone trogg]]s and we'll be unable to repel them.

I've sent the arch [[geomancer]] ahead. Get to Slate Quicksand and do as he asks.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|1|65}} at max level

==Completion==
Good, <race>, you're here.

We'll have to act fast if we're to prevent Therazane's forces from attacking.

==Notes==
To the south, down a level.
