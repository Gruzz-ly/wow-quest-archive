Deliver the Catapult Parts to {{NPC||Peak Grindstone}} on the [[Fractured Front]] in [[Deepholm]].

== Description ==
Peak Grindstone's team broke down somewhere out there to the west.

Think you can make yourself useful for a change and rush some parts out to them, <race>?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Are those spare parts you have there?

== Completion ==
I can't thank you enough, <class>. Now let's see if we can get this catapult moving again.

== Notes ==
Head a few hundred yards west. At the base of a big blue rock face is Peak, another Catapult Driver and the broken catapult.
