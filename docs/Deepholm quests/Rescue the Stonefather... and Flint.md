== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Bouldergut.jpg|Bouldergut|Slay the stone trogg chieftain to rescue the Stonefather... and Flint!}}
Free Stonefather Oremantle.
* {{NPC||Stonefather Oremantle}} rescued

== Description ==
We found out where the Stonefather is being held and young Flint ran off on his own to rescue him alone!

I don't have to tell you that this is bad. Flint is going to get himself captured as well, or worse!

The stone trogg chieftain, Bouldergut, is at the end of the ledges above [[Needlerock Chasm]] to the north.

Please, <name>, you must go after Flint and free the Stonefather before we lose them both! 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox
|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Shattered Bond Treads
|Liberator's Girdle
|Oremantle's Favor}}
You will also receive: {{cost|17|20}}

== Progress ==
You must rescue Stonefather Oremantle. There's no time to waste, <name>!

== Completion ==
<name>! You did it! How will we ever repay you? 

== Notes ==
Keep flying on the top upper level north to find Boldergut in combat with Flint and the Stonefather chained up. Before getting there to help him Flint finish Bouldergut off, though, the Stonefather has some random taunts:
*{{text|yell|Stonefather Oremantle|Damned stinking stone trogg! I'll never tell you where I hid the World Pillar Fragment!}}
*{{text|yell|Stonefather Oremantle|Bouldergut, you coward! Fight someone your own size!}}
*{{text|yell|Stonefather Oremantle|Flint! Get out of here! He's too powerful!}}
*{{text|yell|Stonefather Oremantle|Free me now before it's too late! Deepholm cannot survive much longer without the World Pillar intact!}}
*{{text|yell|Stonefather Oremantle|Let me out of these chains! I'll reduce you to rubble!}}
*{{text|yell|Stonefather Oremantle|You're too late, Bouldergut! The proverbial cavalry has arrived!}}
*{{text|yell|Stonefather Oremantle|You don't know what you're doing, Bouldergut! By keeping me captive, you're dooming Deepholm and us all!}}
*{{text|yell|Stonefather Oremantle|Nothing in all of the elemental planes will stop me from killing you once I get out of these chains, Bouldergut!}}
Flint is quite nearly dead, so join in to help finish Bouldergut off.
:{{text|yell|Flint Oremantle|<Name>! You're a sight for sore eyes. Get over here and give me a hand, would you?}}
Victory!
:{{text|yell|Flint Oremantle|Father! Let me get you free of those chains.}}
:{{text|yell|Flint Oremantle|Father, this hero represents the Earthen Ring. They need the middle fragment.}}
:{{text|yell|Stonefather Oremantle|You've saved both myself and my son.}}
:{{text|yell|Stonefather Oremantle|You have my gratitude and that of my people.}}
:{{text|yell|Stonefather Oremantle|Return to Pyrium Lodestone with the good news. We'll see you back at Stonehearth shortly.}}
:{{text|yell|Stonefather Oremantle|I'll see to it that you get the middle fragment of the World Pillar.}}
:{{text|yell|Flint Oremantle|Sorry about my earlier rudeness. I was worried about my father. Friends?}}
