*{{NPC||Tawn Winterbluff}} relieved
*{{NPC||Stormcaller Mylra}} relieved
*{{NPC||Hargoth Dimblaze}} relieved

== Description ==
When da attack started, we pushed out to take da field as quickly as we could. Dere forces were deep and endless... we underestimated dem. Now some of our best shaman be stranded out dere, exhausted, far from our defenses.

Make your way out and take da pressure off of our stranded brothas. Even a small break in battle be a chance to get much needed room ta breath.

Be swift, <class>. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Perhaps it was foolish of me to let dem be pressin' out so far. Everythin' I know of da [[earth elemental]]s told me an attack like dis couldn't be lastin'... dat dey were just lashin' out in dere rage, and would beleavin' just as quickly.

It be very clear now dat I was wrong.

== Completion ==
Thank you, <class>. Many [[Earthen Ring]] owe dere lives to ya dis day. 

== Notes ==
Pick up [[On Even Ground]] and [[Core of Our Troubles]] before heading out. On accept, giant purple arrows appear out in the field over the heads of the three targets. Look quick to get their position, then start flying. There are two to three Irestone Rumblers and/or a Servant of Therazane attacking each shaman. Get the shaman out of combat by defeating their attackers, which also gains credit for the other quests; it is possible and wise to use the [[Elementium Grapple Line]] from [[On Even Ground]] against the giants.

All the shaman share quotes:
*{{text|say|Don't stay out here too long, there will be more on top of you any second.}}
*{{text|say|I'd started to think we'd been left out here. Thanks for the hand!}}
*{{text|say|Thanks for the relief. It's getting hairy out here.}}
*{{text|say|By the elementals... that one... just wouldn't die.}}
