== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Slate Quicksand}} at [[Needlerock Chasm]] in [[Deepholm]].

== Description ==
Down below in the Needlerock Chasm is where the {{NPC||Needlerock Mystic||mystics}} are sprouting all of these [[fungal giant|fungal monstrosities]]. I sent Slate Quicksand and a small force to deal with it, but they've run into a snag.

You remember the Arch Geomancer? Would you fly down there and lend him a hand?

== Completion ==
Good to see you again, <name>. Now we'll get somewhere.

== Notes ==
Fly northeast, then down over the cliff. Slate has some interesting gossip text:
:When {{NPC||Deathwing}} destroyed the [[World Pillar]], he broke open a rift between [[Azeroth|your world]] and ours. These spores and fungi are one consequence.
:Let's see if we can deal with them together.

==Progression==
