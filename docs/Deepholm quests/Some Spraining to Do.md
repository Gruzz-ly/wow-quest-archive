== Notes ==
Hop on. Stormbeak flies to the starboard rotor and hovers just above it at various heights, as a not-so-implicit threat to Mor'norokk:
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|All right, sunshine. Time to spill your guts before I spill 'em for ya!}}
:{{text|yell|Mor'norokk the Hateful|Wait! You can't do this! You people must have a code of honor or something!}}
:''Up.''
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|I'm a daughter of the [[Wildhammer Clan]] and a shaman of the [[Earthen Ring]]. My code compels me to honor my ancestors and the elements.}}
:''Down.''
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|Doesn't say a damn thing about dog-ugly ogres.}}
:''Up.''
:{{text|yell|Mor'norokk the Hateful|Stop it, you tiny, angry woman! I'll tell you everything! What do you want to know?}}
:''Down.''
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|You can start by telling us where the [[World Pillar]] fragment is. My [[gryphon]]'s starting to look a}} [wee] {{text|say|bit tired from hauling you around.}}
:{{text|yell|Mor'norokk the Hateful|It was delivered to the forgemaster at [[Deathwing's Fall]]. I swear... that's all I know!}}
:{{text|yell|Mor'norokk the Hateful|Happy now? Pull me up, you vicious little [[dwarf]]!}}
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|You were never in any danger, sweetheart. My friends down below would've caught you. You're worth far too much to us alive!}}
:''Five [[Wind Servant]]s appear between Mor'norokk and the whirling blades.  Mor'norokk reacts with growing panic.''
:{{text|yell|Mor'norokk the Hateful|What? What have you done? No! Do you have any idea what the [[Twilight Council]] will do to me when they find out I've talked? I would sooner die!}}
:''Mor'norokk [[Chain Lightning]]s the wind servants and cuts the chain, killing himself in the rotors.''
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|Interesting. I'd never heard of the Twilight Council before now.}}
:''Stormbeak flies back to the poopdeck.''
