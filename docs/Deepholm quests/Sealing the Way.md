==Objectives==
Help the [[Earthen Geomancer]]s to get out of combat and then give them the Rockslide Reagents so that they can seal the Armory, Inn, Barracks, and Shrine.
*Armory sealed
*Inn sealed
*Barracks sealed
*Shrine sealed
*[[Rockslide Reagent]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[stone trogg]]s have found a way to burrow up from underneath our homes!

I've sent geomancers to seal all of the buildings, but they need these reagents and enough time out of battle to properly cast their Rockslide rituals.

When you're done, report to the general, [[Gravel Longslab]], just north on the [[Fractured Front]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Rockslide Treads|Earthswell Belt|Geomancer's Mace}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|20}}

==Progress==
I know that the commander sent you, <race>. Are all of the entrances sealed in Stonehearth behind us?

==Completion==
This is good. We no longer need to worry about stone trogg attacks from the rear.

Let's see what you can do for us on the battlefront.

==Notes==
Finish up [[We're Surrounded]] and pick up [[Thunder Stones]] before heading out. The four buildings are located clockwise around a large pillar in the middle of [[Stonehearth]], with the quest giver at 3:00 or so. Kill the attacking diggers to get the geomancers out of combat, then use the reagents with the geomancer targeted to have him call down a rockslide on the building. After all four are sealed, head north-northwest along the path to find the next front.
