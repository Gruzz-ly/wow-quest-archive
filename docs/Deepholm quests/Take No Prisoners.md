== Objectives ==
Slay 6 Twilight Saboteurs.
*[[Twilight Saboteur]] slain x6

== Description ==
It looks like the [[Twilight's Hammer]]'s still on the ship. Go below decks and take them out.

Be careful, <name>. I've a feeling they're not here for a spiritual retreat, if you know what I mean.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
Is it done, <name>?

== Completion ==
Well done, <name>. The Twilight's Hammer is an evil that we must fight anywhere we find them.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[On Second Thought, Take One Prisoner]] before heading below decks. Plenty of cultists on the mid deck and the low deck.

==Progression==
