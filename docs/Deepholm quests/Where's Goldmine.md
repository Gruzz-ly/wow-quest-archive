== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Initiate Goldmine}} at [[Quartzite Basin]] in [[Deepholm]].

== Description ==
My [[goblin]] initiate has been gone for quite some time. His name is Goldmine.

I sent him out to observe the local [[rock flayer]]s southwest at the Quartite Basin. Perhaps you would be willing to find him? When you do, please ask him to come back to the temple.

== Completion ==
Hiya! Lend a hand, would ya, bub?

== Notes ==
Head southwest. Just outside the temple is Goldmine, standing over a very wounded {{NPC||Flint Oremantle}}, the earthen prince.
