==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Aeosera.jpg||Aesera, Broodmother of the Stone Drakes.}}
Defeat Aeosera.
*Pale Resonating Crystal struck
*[[Aeosera]] defeated
*[[Stonework Mallet]] (provided)

==Description==
On the western edge of the [[Pale Roost]], you will find a resonating crystal. Strike it with the mallet and the broodmother will come.

Be ready for battle. I will be there to aid you, but she will not be easily overcome.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Stonescale Robes|Terrath's Rocky Spaulders|Dragonsaw Boneblade}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|60}}

==Progress==
This broodmother has taken wing for over these stone drakes for nearly 300 years. She is quite strong, even for a stone dragon.

==Completion==
Impressive, fleshling. You are far more capable than I initially assumed.

I will send that sentiment to the [[Therazane|Stonemother]] as well.

==Notes==
Fly west to find the resonating crystal. Bang on it and Terrath will come and throw the player up to some floating rocks! (If he does not show up, look up and jump on the lowest rock.  You should see a green mount arrow for that rock.)
:{{text|yell|Terrath the Steady|You've strayed too far from the Stonemother's gaze, dragon. It is time that you be put in your place.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Jump from rock to rock to attract the attention of the Broodmother!}}
Jump up the stairway of rocks by right-clicking on them to reach a "plateau" of rocks all floating at the same height. Keep jumping about until...
:{{text|emote|The Stone Dragon Broodmother approaches.}}
Aeosera has one ability:
*{{abilities|Searing Breath|range=55|Sears the target rock with flame, causing Fire damage to any enemy nearby.|notes=0.875 sec cast. 10 sec channel}}
Aeosera will target the rock the player is standing on, then cast searing breath at it. At the end of the cast, the rock is destroyed!
*{{text|bossemote|This rock is about to fall! Jump to another!}}
So... attack quickly and keep moving. Every now and then, selected boulders gain one of two abilities:
*{{abilities|Crystalline Surge|A pocket of earth energy envelops nearby units, increasing damage by 50%. Lasts 20 sec.|notes=Green glow.}}
*{{abilities|Crystalline Barrier|A crystalline barrier forms around the resonating stone, causing nearby allies to take 50% less damage and regenerate 5% of their maximum health every second. Lasts 20 sec.|notes=Gold glow. Also regenerates mana for mana-using classes.}}
She has 347,000 health and will submit after getting knocked down to 40,000 health or so.
:{{text|bossemote|The Stone Dragon Broodmother bows her head in surrender.}}
:{{text|yell|Terrath the Steady|She submits. Well done, fleshling.}}
This concludes Terrath's chain. Head all the way to the east to complete [[Rocky Upheaval]].
