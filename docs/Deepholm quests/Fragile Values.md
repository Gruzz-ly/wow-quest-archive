== Objectives ==
Retrieve a Stonework Mallet.
*[[Stonework Mallet (quest item)]]

== Description ==
It is now time to draw the Broodmother's attention. To do so, we will need a mallet that the [[stone trogg|trogg]]s will use when making offerings to her.

See out the {{NPC||Stone Trogg Beast Tamer}}s that are attempting to tame [[basilisk]]s in the sothern portions of the [[Pale Roost]]. You will find a mallet on one of their corpses.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Did you find a mallet?

== Completion ==
Glorious.

Now we will deal a blow to the [[stone dragon]]s that they will remember for the next hundred years.

== Notes ==
Head southeast to find a beast tamer trying to tame a basilisk. Aggro the beast tamer, then pull away from the basilisk to keep it from joining the fight.
