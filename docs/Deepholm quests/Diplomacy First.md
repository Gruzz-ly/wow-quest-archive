== Objectives ==
Meet {{NPC||Stormcaller Mylra}} aboard the Alliance Gunship.

== Description ==
The [[Earthen Ring]] is a neutral organization, <name>. We cannot pick sides between the [[Horde]] and the [[Alliance]].

Look all around you—our members come from all backgrounds. Our mission would be compromised should racial tensions be put above our goal. Let's try to keep this under wraps until we have more information.

We must not jump to conclusions just yet. I'll send you and one of our newer members to look for the Alliance gunship.

Find out what you can without dragging us into the conflict.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|10}}

== Completion ==
Oi, <name>! I was told I'd have company soon.

== Notes ==
The ship is circling east of the temple. Mylra is astern on the poop deck. The Alliance crew appears to have been slain, but by whom?

If you aren't offered this quest, you must complete the pre-requisite quest [[Captain's Log (quest)]]. This situation may arise if you are in a group when inspecting the Storm's Fury Wreckage for [[Gunship Down]] if you don't enter that section of the airship, as the quest marker doesn't appear on the minimap.
