==Objectives==
Place the trapped meat in the western end of the [[Alabaster Shelf]].
*[[Stonescale Matriarch]] slain
*[[Trapped Basilisk Meat]] (provided)

==Description==
You must set the trap for the matriarch now.

Go to the western end of the Alabaster Shelf and place the trapped basilisk meat in the center of the feeding ground.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Trapspring Leggings|Bait-Stained Drape|Soulbind Choker}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|20}}

==Progress==
It seems like the trap will work on Abyssion.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Here's to hoping the trap performs as well when we try it on Abyssion.

==Notes==
Quote literally the southwestern end of the shelf . There's a big blood-stained area at {{co|50.8|85.2|Deepholm}} behind a crystal formation with lots of carcasses and such. Use the Trapped Basilisk Meat there. The Matriarch will fly in and get trapped. She is an 82 elite with 134,037 health.
:{{text|bossemote|You hear rustling of heavy wings in the distance. The matriarch approaches!}}
:{{text|bossemote|The Stonescale Matriarch is snared! Avoid her attacks by staying on the move!}}
She has two attacks:
*{{abilities|Sand Breath|range=Melee|Inflicts Arcane damage to enemies in a cone in front of the caster, reducing their movement and increasing their time between attacks for 10 sec.|notes=3.5 sec cast}}
*{{abilities|Stone Spike|range=60|Launches a spike at the target, causing physical damage.|notes=1.75 sec cast}}
**{{abilities|Stone Spike Explosion|notes=Hits for 5200-6600 Shadow against players within a few yards of the spike when it lands}}

This is going to be a very hit-and-run fight. Try to attack from range with quick abilities, but keep moving! The matriarch does take 3000 damage every few seconds just by virtue of being snared, but she must have someone on her aggro table or she will dsappear.
