== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Maruut Stonebinder}} at the [[Temple of Earth]] in [[Deepholm]].

== Description ==
You must get word back to the others at the temple. Chances are, the fragment is already getting moved to a more secure location.

Tell Maruut what you know. I'm going to do a little investigating about this [[Twilight Council]] in the meantime.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

== Completion ==
We must investigate your findings further, but we must not lose track of the fragment.
