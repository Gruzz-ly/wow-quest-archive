== Objectives ==
Speak to the "fleshling" intruders in the [[Crimson Expanse]].

== Description ==
Fleshling. Some of your kind skitter among the rocks. Too cowardly to approach, too swift to be crushed.

If you wish my favor, deal with them. I tire of these games.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|2|15}}

== Completion ==
It is good to see you again, <brother/sister>. I see that your efforts go well. The [[Stone Lords]] appear to be showing you some degree of trust.

We've come to help. We might be of some aid in tracking down the source of this sudden growth. I highly suspect your {{NPC||Gorsik the Tumultuous||giant friend's}} aggressions are focused in the wrong direction.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Doomshrooms]] and [[Gone Soft]] before heading out.

Out in the field are {{NPC||Windspeaker Lorvarius}} and {{NPC||Earthmender Norsala}} by the corpse of a {{NPC||Fungal Behemoth}}! Lovarius should have seen Gorsik's reaction coming...
:We've come to try to help, but it seems that their favor for you does not yet extend to us.
