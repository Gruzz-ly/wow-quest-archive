== Objectives ==
Obtain a Dragon Snare from the {{NPC||Twilight Dragonstalker}}s.
*[[Twilight Snare]]

== Description ==
Having a dragon guard the fragment was a smart move on the enemy's part. They can keep moving its location any time we get close to it.

Catching {{NPC||Abyssion}} will be extremely difficult, but I have a plan that might help.

The [[Twilight's Hammer]] uses magical traps to bind [[stone drake]]s to the ground while they drain their energy.

If we can get our hands on one of these, we might just be able to ground the [[twilight dragon|Twilight Dragon]] for just long enough.

Go west of here, to the [[Alabaster Shelf]], and obtain a trap.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

== Progress ==
If the snares are good enough for stone drakes, they might work on Abyssion.

== Completion ==
Let's see if that snare can ground something larger than a drake.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Big Game, Big Bait]] before heading out. Head west to the shelf and look for a group of four dragonstalkers around a dragon corpse. They can be picked off individually, so do so.
