== Objectives ==
Reactivate 5 Deactivated War Constructs.
*{{NPC||Deactivated War Construct}}s reactivated x5

== Description ==
We sent a number of our war constructs into [[Needlerock Slag]], but none of them ever returned. We know that the [[stone trogg]] {{NPC||Needlerock Mystic||mystics}} have done something to them.

What we're concerned about is that the mystics will control them and turn them against us, like they have with the [[fungal giant]]s.

<Name>, go into the stone trogg town and reactivate the constructs.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
We'll need a few more reactivated. The last thing we want is to have to face our own constructs on top of all of this!

== Completion ==
That was a nice bit of work, <name>.

With our constructs back up and running behind their main lines, it's only a matter of time now before we make the big push through and rescue the king.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Mystic Masters]] before heading out. Fly over the front line, then land when safely past the spawning troggs and fungal giants. Run in and activate a construct, then use it to help kill a trogg. Then repeat.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Pyrium Lodestone|<Name>, you're going to want to fly over these giants and stone troggs. Don't try to ride through them.}}
