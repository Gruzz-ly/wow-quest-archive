== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Irestone Cores.
*[[Irestone Core]] x6

== Description ==
Elementals are chaotic by nature, but dis kind of organized aggression is out of character. More so down here where dere deaths be a bit more permanent. I suspect dis is {{NPC||Therazane||Therazane the Stonemother's}} doin', but I have to be sure.

Destroy da {{NPC||Irestone Rumbler}}s and bring me their cores. We'll be settlin' here and now if dis is da Stonemother's hatred brought down on us. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
We've never been claimin' a great friendship with da [[Elemental Lord]]s, but we still be trustin' in a bit of security in da chaos. As long as dey be remainin' unorganized, we've been havin' little to fear.

If the Stonemother is truly rallyin' da earth against us, we be havin' a great deal more to be fearin'. 

== Completion ==
Dese are in surprisingly good condition - good work, mon. 

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Crumbling Defenses]] and [[On Even Ground]] before heading out. Don't focus on killing elementals. Focus on saving the shaman. Then go kill elementals once the three shaman are saved.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Earthmender Norsala|So it is certain, den. Dese elementals were bound from dormant stone only recently.}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Norsala|Only an elemental lord could bind so many elementals so quickly. It seems we are at war with da Stonemother herself...}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Norsala|May da elements protect us.}}
