==Objectives==
Speak with [[Crag Rockcrusher]] at [[Stonehearth]] in [[Deepholm]]. 

== Description ==
The [[earthen]] and the [[stone trogg]]s somehow found their way to Deepholm through [[Uldum]] more than fifteen thousand years ago. They've been warring ever since.

If we're to recover the middle fragment of the [[World Pillar]], the Stonefather must be rescued.

Please go to Stonehearth and do everything that you can to aid the Earthen in their war against the stone troggs.

You're our best hope, <name>.

== Completion ==
The Stonefather's son, Flint, sent you? No time to talk.

We must prevent a second front from opening up on the war! 

== Notes ==
Fly all the way to the southwest corner of the zone. Up on a high ridge is Stone Hearth, littered with fighting between Earthen and stone trogg. On the west side of a small building is Crag Rockcrusher.
