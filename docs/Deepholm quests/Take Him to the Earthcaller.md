== Objectives ==
Introduce {{NPC||Flint Oremantle}} to {{NPC||Earthcaller Yevaa}} at the [[Temple of Earth]].
*Flint Oremantle introduced to Earthcaller Yevaa

== Description ==
He still looks a little loopy.

Best get him inside the temple and see what the Eartcaller wants to do with him.

I think I'm going to stay out here a little while longer and "observe" these [[rock flayer]]s.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Legs of Ringing Echoes
|Flayer-Crush Boots
|Bell-Ringer's Skullcap}}

== Completion ==
We are honored by Flint Oremantle's presence. I am given to understand that {{NPC||Stonefather Oremantle||the Stonefather}} is in possession of a fragment of the [[World Pillar]].

It is imperative that we recover all of the fragments. The instability between worlds is increasing. Soon it may become too great even for mighty {{NPC||Thrall}} to hold at bay.

== Notes ==
On accept, Flint wakes up and follows the player around:
:{{text|say|Flint Oremantle|I am ready to meet with your so-called Earthcaller.}}
Then, as the player takes him to the temple:
*{{text|say|Flint Oremantle|Take me to this [[Earthen Ring]] friend of yours. I have important news for the two of you.}}
*{{text|say|Flint Oremantle|We are going to the Temple of Earth, yes?}}
*{{text|say|Flint Oremantle|You would be wise not to waste time. If my father dies, he takes with him the knowledge of where the second World Pillar Fragment is hidden. I know that you people want it.}}
*{{text|say|Flint Oremantle|You must drop everything that you're doing to help me free my father, the Earthen king.}}
*{{text|say|Flint Oremantle|The only thing that matters is that we rescue my father.}}
*{{text|say|Flint Oremantle|The war between the Earthen and the stone troggs has raged for time beyond measure. But now in the chaos, they have taken my father, the Stonefather, prisoner. They are threatening to kill him if we do not surrender.}}
*{{text|say|Flint Oremantle|I was on my way to the temple when I was jumped. My father must be rescued before the stone troggs kill him.}}
*{{text|say|Flint Oremantle|We must hurry and speak with your Earthen Ring friend.}}
Getting in range of Yevaa:
:{{text|say|Earthcaller Yevaa|What have we here, <name>?}}
:{{text|say|Flint Oremantle|Earthcaller, my father, Stonefather Oremantle, has been taken prisoner by the stone troggs of [[Needlerock Spire]].}}
:{{text|say|Flint Oremantle|I demand that you send aid to Stonehearth. Help us with our war and to free Stonefather Oremantle.}}
:{{text|say|Flint Oremantle|This one that assisted me here should be adequate. Have them report to our force commander, {{NPC||Crag Rockcrusher}} at [[Stonehearth]].}}
