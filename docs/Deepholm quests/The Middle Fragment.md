== Description ==
I present you with the key to [[Stonehearth]]. With it you may unlock the vault to my home and recover the middle fragment of the World Pillar.

Know that you are always welcome here.

== Progress ==
You've returned. Did you recover the middle fragment?

== Completion ==
The Middle Fragment of the World Pillar!

Thank you, <name>! I can only imagine what you had to go through to get this to us. I'll see to it that it's placed within the center of the chamber.

== Notes ==
Interact with the door behind the Oremantles to collect the fragment. Then, back to the temple!
