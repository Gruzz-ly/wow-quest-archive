==Objectives==
Use [[Stormbeak]] to fly into the [[Maelstrom]] with [[Thrall]] and [[Mylra]].
* Use Stormbeak to Fly Into the Maelstrom

==Description==
You saved us all, [[shaman]]! Thank you!

Thrall wants to dive right into the Maelstrom and retrieve the [[Doomhammer]], but I worry - he was badly wounded in that last fight, and that [[demon]] [[Geth'xun]] may still be alive down there. We should go with him.

Hop on Stormbeak when you're ready and we'll track down that artifact!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,480 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Quickly. Into the Maelstrom!

==Completion==
The Doomhammer could be anywhere here. And that demon is still alive.

==Notes==
;Upon Chosen Artifact (first only)
:{{text|say|Thrall|We must move quickly. Speak with Mylra and follow me into the Maelstrom.}}

;Hop on Stormbeak
:''Thrall hops on an [[Armored Wyvern (Maelstrom)|Armored Wyvern]].''
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|The Doomhammer fell somewhere below. Hold on! This part always gives me tummy the wubblies!}}
:''Stormbeak heads into the center of the Maelstrom.''
In Deepholm:
:''A cutscene plays out.''
:{{text|say|Thrall|The Doomhammer could be anywhere. We'll have to split up.}}
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|I'll see if the [[Earthen]] at [[Stonehearth]] saw anything.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I will speak with the shaman at the [[Temple of Earth]].}}

On the other end of the cutscene:
:{{text|say|Thrall|Shaman, you must seek out the [[Therazane|Stonemother]]. But be cautious - she is quick to anger.}}

==Progression==
{{Shaman artifact and class hall}}
