== Objectives ==
Find the [[Forgemaster's Log]] at [[Deathwing's Fall]] in [[Deepholm]].

== Description ==
Go to the tower the slave spoke of. You should find it on the northeastern end of the camp.

If we can act fast enough we might be able to eavesdrop on the forgemaster's meeting.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Completion ==
There is an entry for an upcoming meeting at the [[Upper Silvermarsh]].

This must be where the Forgemaster is.

== Notes ==
To the northeast of the lava pit! The log is at {{co|63.7|55.4|Deepholm}} guarded by a {{NPC||Twilight Bloodsmith}} atop the tower.
