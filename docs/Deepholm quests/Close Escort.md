==Objectives==
Escort the Earthen Catapult safely to [[Needlerock Slag]].
*[[Earthen Catapult]] safely escorted

==Description==
Alright, I think I've got it working again. You've got to get the catapult to the [[stone trogg]] town, Needlerock Slag, just to the north of the [[Fractured Front|front]].

The [[Catapult Driver|driver]] will go with you. I'll head back and let [[Gravel Longslab|Gravel]] know.

There's no doubt that the stone troggs will try to stop you. You just keep them off of the catapult. It packs a big punch.

Let me know when you're ready, <name>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Earthen Embrace

}}
You will also receive: {{cost|17|20}}

==Progress==
Where's the catapult? You have to go back and get it.

==Completion==
<The catapult chief gives you an appraising look.>

Word of your prowess has spread ahead of you, <race>. Let's see if you can help us keep these [[Fungal Horror|fungal horrors]] off of the front.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Peak Grindstone|Let me know when you're ready, <name>.}}

Talk to Peak:
:We've got to get out of here!

:{{gossip|Peak, I'm ready to escort the catapult.}}
:{{text|yell|Catapult Driver|Alright, here we go!}}

There are three scripted spawn events. The catapult driver will do his best to avoid non-scripted troggs. When the catapult is ambushed, try to keep the troggs in one spot ~10 yards away from the catapult. The driver will then take them out with a geode round.
:{{text|bossemote|Stone troggs are attacking!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Here come more stone troggs. Defend the catapult!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Looks like a last ditch effort by the stone troggs. Your destination is just around the corner!}}
*{{text|yell|Catapult Driver|Alright, let's get going.}}
*{{text|yell|Catapult Driver|How'd that feel, you stone trogg scum?!}}
*{{text|yell|Catapult Driver|The faster we can get to the other side of the battlefront, the faster we can reduce Needlerock Slag to rubble.}}
*{{text|yell|Catapult Driver|We need to keep moving!}}
*{{text|yell|Catapult Driver|You stone troggs have no idea of what's coming!}}
*{{text|yell|Catapult Driver|Moving out!}}
*{{text|yell|Catapult Driver|Let's head out. Just keep those stone troggs off of us.}}
*{{text|yell|Catapult Driver|Oh yeah! Tremble at the might of our catapults!}}

After clearing the third ambush, keep heading to the east to reach [[Pyrium Lodestone]] and [[Flint Oremantle]]:
:{{text|say|Flint Oremantle|<Name>? It's about time you got here. What kept you? My father's life is in jeopardy!}}
