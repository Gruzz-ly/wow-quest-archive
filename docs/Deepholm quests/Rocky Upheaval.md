== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Gorsik the Tumultuous}} upon the [[Crimson Expanse]].

== Description ==
To the east, on the Crimson Expanse, you will find Gorsik. He embodies the more unstable and violent nature of [[stone giant|our kind]]. He is neither friendly, nor trusting, but his word carries weight.

Proving yourself to Gorsik will go a long way towards proving yourself to the {{NPC||Therazane||Stonemother}}.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|2|15}}

== Completion ==
You are {{NPC||Diamant the Patient||Diamant's}} chosen.

So small.

So fragile.

Do you realize that your actions shall be the basis which your entire "[[Earthen Ring]]" is judged? You truly think you can stand for so many?

You are a fool. A confident fool. We shall see if you are a capable fool as well.

== Notes ==
Head back to the temple, then due east to the [[Crimson Expanse]], which is north of the [[Upper Silvermarsh]]. Gorsik is standing at the southern end of the area, near a ring of earth elementals.
