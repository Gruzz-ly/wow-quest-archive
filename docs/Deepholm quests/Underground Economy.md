==Objectives==
Use Ricket's Tickers to gather 3 Deep Alabaster Crystals, 3 Deep Celestite Crystals, 3 Deep Amethyst Crystals, and 3 Deep Garget Crystals.
* [[Deep Alabaster Crystal]] x3
* [[Deep Celestite Crystal]] x3
* [[Deep Amethyst Crystal]] x3
* [[Deep Garnet Crystal]] x3
* [[Ricket's Tickers]] (provided)

==Description==
Hey! I need some help gatherin' crystals. The [[elemental]]s trade top dollar for these things... if you help me gather all the different kinds, I'll cut you in on the profits.

Use these bombs to blow out chunks from the bigger formations.

I've got a nasty habit of packin' the explosives a bit thick. Mind the kick.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|50|}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Therazane]]

==Progress==
Boom? 

==Completion==
Well played!

I've got this pretty sweet deal going. A bunch of shmucks go up there to [[Therazane's Throne]] and give all kinds of gold to [[D'lom the Collector|D'lom]] for who-knows-what kinda crap. He forks all that cash over to me for these crystals. I go home freakin' rich for a couple chunks of rock.

Don't tell no one though. I don't want no competition springin' up.

Think you can come back later to help me get another load of crystals out?

==Notes==
The four types of crystals can be found in each of the rooms (not the connecting tunnels) of the [[Crumbling Depths]].
