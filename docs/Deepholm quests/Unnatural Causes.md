== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Gorsik the Tumultuous}} in the [[Crimson Expanse]].

== Description ==
This is most definitely magic in origin. Not even [[druid]]ic. I suspect one among the [[stone trogg]]s to the north.

Go to Gorsik and point him in their direction. Hopefully this will help earn his favor.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|2|15}}

== Completion ==
The stone troggs? And I am to trust you at your word?

I have no love for the [[Verlok]] anyway. Suspicion is more than enough reason to lay waste to them. We shall see if your word is true.

== Notes ==
Back to the south... Yay racial isssues-inspired genocide!
