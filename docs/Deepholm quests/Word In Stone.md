== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Maruut Stonebinder}} in the [[Temple of Earth]].

== Description ==
You have done as I've asked of you, <race>. I shall honor my word. {{NPC||Gorsik the Tumultuous||Gorsik}} will meet you at the temple with our piece of the [[World Pillar]].

Finish your ritual and bind the rift. After you have done such, tell your [[Earthen Ring]] to leave this place.

You, however... you can stay for a time if you want. You've earned at least that.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Completion ==
Gorsik has arrived. All of the pieces of the World Pillar are here, thanks to you.

What you have done for us is immeasurable. These final moments shall be most crucial. I hesitate to ask more of you, but I'd like you to stay with us and see this through.

The [[Twilight's Hammer]] was devastated by your attacks, but not destroyed. It's no stretch to assume they will try to stop us from completing our ritual.

== Notes ==
Back to the temple for the last time. All of the Earthen Ring in Deepholm are there.
