==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ma'haat the Indomitable]] in [[Deepholm]] to acquire a Fossilized Egg. He will require 5{{sic}} [[:Blood of Sargeras]] in trade.

==Description==
In order to imbue the [[Maelstrom Pillar]] with the essence of earth, we will need one of the rarest fossils found on [[Azeroth]] - an egg.

The [[:Egg of Gaiath]] is no ordinary egg; it contains the remnants of an unborn [[earthen]] [[Primal (occupation)|primal]], perfectly preserved in stone. There may be a means by which to revive it, but more on that later.

First, we must find that egg!

The [[Earthen Ring]] has heard of an ancient being who possesses such an item, but he will require payment in blood!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Ma'haat the Indomitable speaks with a low, rumbling voice>

What... do you ask... of the earth?

==Progression==
{{Shaman artifact and class hall}}
