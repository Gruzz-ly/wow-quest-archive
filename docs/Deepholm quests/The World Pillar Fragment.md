==Objectives==
Place the Earthen Ring Banner in the center of [[Abyssion's Lair]], slay him and obtain the Upper World Pillar Fragment.
*[[The Upper World Pillar Fragment]]
*[[Earthen Ring Banner]] (provided)

==Description==
It's time, <name>. We have spotted [[Abyssion]] making his way to the lair.

The [[Twilight's Hammer]] might've though the fragment would be safe if a dragon guarded it, but I've met enough dragons to know their one weakness. Pride.

Abyssion's not going to run from a fight with us puny [[mortal]]s.

Place the banner of the [[Earthen Ring]] in the middle of his lair. Once we defeat him, bring the fragment to [[Maruut Stonebinder|Maruut]]. We need to repair the [[World Pillar]] as soon as possible.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Worldbinder Signet|Stonebinder's Cloak|Amulet of Reconstruction}}
You will also receive: {{cost|17|20}}

==Progress==
<Name>! You've returned!

==Completion==
Your efforts in repairing the World Pillar are invaluable, <name>. Once the [[Temple of Earth]]'s structure is stable again, the rift between the worlds will begin to stabilize.

==Notes==
The hero must kill Abyssion in a very similar fight to the one with the matriarch earlier: Abyssion is rooted but casts spells constantly, most of which can be dodged by staying in motion.

The Shadow Nova, however, hits in an area centered on Abyssion. Despite a raid alert saying to "take cover", this spell can still hit through obstacles around Abyssion, so the very long casting time could be used to run completely out of range. On the other hand, the rest of Abyssion's spells can be dodged easily, so taking the hit may be acceptable - there should be plenty of time to either kill him or heal after a Shadow Nova.

===Full encounter transcript===
Fly east back to the lair. In the very center of the lair is an egg area. Plant the banner there:
:{{text|bossemote|Abyssion is approaching. Get ready!}}
Mylra and a few shaman come to help, but players are mostly on their own.
:{{text|yell|Stormcaller Mylra|he's coming. Get ready, lads!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Abyssion is snared! Stay on the move to avoid his attacks.}}
