*Upper Silvermarsh reached

== Description ==
{{questportrait|Maruut Stonebinder.jpg|Maruut Stonebinder|We're familiar with the meeting location.}}
Excellent work, <name>. We know exactly where the meeting location is.

The Upper Silvermarsh is a mercury swamp to the east of here. It's normally only inhabited by [[elemental]]s and occasional [[stone trogg]]s, but our scouts have seen some [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight]] activity in the region.

Make your way there and let's find a way to eavesdrop on the Forgemaster's meeting.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|4|10}}

== Progress ==
We'll get that fragment back, <name>. We have no choice.

== Completion ==
{{questportrait|Maruut Stonebinder.jpg|Maruut Stonebinder|We've arrived.}}
This is the place. Our scouts confirmed the presence of high-ranking Twilight officers nearby as well as potential [[trogg]] hunting parties.

Be on the lookout, <name>.

== Notes ==
Fly to the east-southeast, up past the quarry to reach the Upper Silvermarsh.
