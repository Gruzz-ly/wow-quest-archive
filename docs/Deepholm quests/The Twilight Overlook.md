== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Stormcaller Mylra.jpg|Stormcaller Mylra|Mylra has taken the Twilight Overlook. Meet with her.}}
Speak to {{NPC||Stormcaller Mylra}} at the [[Twilight Overlook]] in [[Deepholm]].

== Description ==
The dragon they're speaking of is {{NPC||Abyssion}}, <name>. It's not going to be easy to get the fragment off of him.

Meet with Mylra again. She is operating nearby at the [[Twilight Overlook]].

She will tell you what our next move will be.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|2|5}}

== Completion ==
So we're going to have to take on Abyssion to get the fragment? This operation just got a whole lot more difficult all of a sudden.

== Notes ==
Head southwest past [[Abyssion's Lair]] to the [[Twilight Overlook]], which has been taken over by the Earthen Ring! Mylra is on her gryphon in the center of camp.
