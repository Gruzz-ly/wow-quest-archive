== Objectives ==
Obtain a [[Trogg Crate]] and use it to submerge yourself and eavesdrop on the [[Twilight's Hammer]] camp to the east.
*World Pillar Fragment Clue uncovered

== Description ==
The [[stone trogg|troggs]] in [[Deepholm]] have proven to be every bit as hostile as the ones in [[Azeroth]]. Yet perhaps their presence will prove useful to our efforts.

The crates they use for trawling through the mercury will conceal you perfectly if you submerge yourself beneath the marsh.

Use it to approach the Twilight's Hammer camp in the eastern end of the [[Upper Silvermarsh]] undetected.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Box-Frame Paulders|Ballast-Laden Footpads|Breathpipe}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
Yes, <name>?

== Completion ==
We have the information we need. Let's not tip our hand by engaging the enemy too soon.

== Notes ==
The crates are not dropped by the troggs... One can be found at {{co|71.7|64.3|Deepholm}} by the mercury pools! However, it's guarded by a trogg. Kill it to collect [[Maziel's Research]], which starts [[Twilight Research]]. Loot one:
:{{text|yell|Murkstone Trogg|You no take crate!}}
Get relatively close to the camp (say the island at {{co|75|64|Deepholm}} just to the north of where the Forgemaster and his three bodyguards are standing) and use the crate to buff with Trogg Crate: "You have a Trogg Crate on your head. This should fool the enemy if you can submerge the rest of your body." Take the hint and get in the mercury. If swimming, players will also be buffed with Submerged: "You are submerged", which provides waterbreathing. Swim closer to the camp until one of the Ogre Bodyguards yells:
:{{text|yell|Ogre Bodyguard|Here she comes, boss!}}
:{{text|yell|High Priestess Azil|Forgemaster! I've been informed the enemy has disrupted your operations. Where is the fragment?}}
:{{text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|The fragment is now in the dragon's custody, ma'am.}}
:{{text|say|High Priestess Azil|Well done. Meet me inside the [[Stonecore]] for further instructions.}}
:{{text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|Of course, ma'am. At once!}}
:{{text|say|Millhouse Manastorm|If you don't mind me asking. How did we manage to recover the fragment? How did we infiltrate our enemies' forces without their knowledge?}}
: ''Azil chuckles.''
:{{text|say|High Priestess Azil|Let's just say we have friends in high places, forgemaster.}}
