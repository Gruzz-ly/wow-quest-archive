==Objectives==
Speak with [[Aggra]] on the [[Staidridge]] in [[Deepholm]] to secure passage to the [[Firelands]].
*Teleport into the Firelands

==Description==
We must travel now to the Firelands. Within that realm, Go'el's burning spirit could become as terrible as [[Ragnaros]] himself! Prepare yourself, for we will be alone in a hostile world.

Speak with me when you are ready... and may the ancestors protect us!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*34700 XP (or {{coppercost|82700}} at max level)
*+75 [[reputation]] with the [[Earthen Ring]]

==Completion==
Be ready, <name>.

==Notes==
Speak to Aggra again:
{{Dialogue|
Brace yourself. The Firelands are a dangerous place... even for a formidable <race> such as yourself.

Let me know when you are ready.

{{gossip|I am prepared. Let us go to the Firelands and finish this.}}
}}

Aggra will teleport herself and the player to [[Ragnaros' Reach]] on the [[Molten Front]]. 

On complete: 
<poem>
{{Text|Say|Aggra|This realm is more terrible than I'd imagined. Even now, I can feel the rage of this place pressing down on me.}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|We won't have time before they're onto us. Let's begin.}}
</poem>

Follow Aggra to get the next quest in the questline. She will run to where Thrall is:
<poem>
{{Text|Say|Aggra|There! I see him, wreathed in flame! I can feel waves of fury radiating from his core. Such rage... his anger alone can burn us all to cinders!}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|Protect me and I'll place guardian totems all around us.}}
</poem>
After she places the totems, pick up the next quest.
