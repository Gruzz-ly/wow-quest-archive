== Objectives ==
Kill 6 Stone Drakes.
*[[Stone Drake]] slain x6

== Description ==
[[Stone dragon]]s bow only to strength. When we have punished them enough, they will bend back to our will.

I have sent many of my strongest giants onto the fields in the west. They will bring the drakes to the ground. You will see to it that they do not take wing again after they fall.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Look to the dragons that have been knocked out of the sky by boulders. They will be easier targets.

== Completion ==
Not just fast it seems. You have some bite in you.

Well done, <class>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Fragile Values]] before heading out. Go east. Lots of opal stonethrowers knocking dragons out of the sky.
