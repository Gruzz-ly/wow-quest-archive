==Objectives==
Speak with [[Muln Earthfury]] in [[Deepholm]].

==Description==
The [[Twilight's Hammer]] has reemerged and they are building an army to overthrow my kingdom. A ludicrous fantasy on their part, but one that I cannot take lightly.

I cannot offer the mortal races my aid until the threat to [[Deepholm]] has been dealt with. If you truly wish to unite the [[Elemental Lord]]s to your cause, I would see you prove it.

Go. Uncover the plot that the Twilight's Hammer is hatching and put an end to their scheme!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
*1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is good that you have arrived, Farseer <name>. The Twilight's Hammer has built a formidable stronghold here in Deepholm.
