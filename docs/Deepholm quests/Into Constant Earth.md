==Objectives==
Speak with [[Therazane]] at [[Therazane's Throne]] in [[Deepholm]].

[[Aggra]] can teleport you to Therazane's Throne from the [[Abyssal Breach]].

==Description==
Time is short! My love lies in Deepholm. I will take us there when you are ready, and we will speak with Therazane the Stonemother.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*34700 XP (or {{cost|8|27}} at max level)
*+75 [[reputation]] with the [[Earthen Ring]]

==Completion==
I already know what it is you seek, fleshlings. And I have chosen to aid you.

==Notes==
Speak to Aggra again:
:The cycle begins again! Go'el has become living stone! We must pursue him within the caverns of [[Deepholm]].
:Seeing as how the Earthen Ring just saved her kingdom, [[Therazane]] should be more than willing to help us in saving him. If not, the Stonemother will answer to me!
:{{gossip|''Aggra, I'm ready to travel to Deepholm.''}}

Speak with Therazane to complete the quest. Completing the quest will give the player the [[Blessing of the Stonemother]] buff if they are not already friendly with the [[Therazane (faction)|Therazane faction]] and start the following conversation:
<poem>
{{Text|Say|Therazane|Yes, mortals, your Thrall is here. He has fused with the stone of this place - heart and soul.}}
{{Text|Say|Therazane|His spirit is strong for a creature of mortal flesh. He fascinates me... and I am loathe to give him up.}}
{{Text|Say|Therazane|Still, I can hear the sound of a distant heart, echoing through labyrinths between worlds. It's the cry of a lover's heart, I hear... and Great Therazane has not forgotten what it was to love...}}
{{Text|Say|Therazane|Your world-shaman stands in the basalt-groves below. But take heed - he has become one with these Unending Halls of Stone.}}
{{Text|Say|Therazane|He may not wish to leave, regardless of whose hear beckons him home.}}
{{Text|Say|Therazane|You may seek him... with my blessing.}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|Thank you, Stonemother.}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|Quickly, friend. Go'el should be just below.}}
</poem>

Speak with Aggra again to continue.
