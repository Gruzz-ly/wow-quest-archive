'''[[Deepholm]]''' is the level 82-83 level-up zone of ''[[Cataclysm]]''. Breadcrumbs to Deepholm first send players to the new [[Earthen Ring]] earthshrines just outside [[Stormwind City]] and [[Orgrimmar]]. During [[The Maelstrom (quest)]], players take a portal to see {{NPC||Thrall}} in the [[Maelstrom]]. Players are then dropped off at the [[Temple of Earth]] in Deepholm to start the long process of recovering the three [[World Pillar]] fragments.

Deepholm is a lightly-phased directed questing experience. The zone plays out as one very, very long quest chain circling around the zone and winding up with a climax back at the Temple of Earth. At that point, optional [[daily quest]]s open up with the [[Therazane (faction)|Therazane]] faction.

The progression of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Deep into Deepholm]].

After Deepholm comes [[Uldum]], starting in the Temple of Earth at level 83 involving some foreshadowing quests at the [[Twilight Terrace]].

==Into Deepholm==
This short introductory chain is optional, if the portal to enter Deepholm directly from the capital cities is used instead.

After arriving in the Temple of Earth, the searches for the [[#Upper World Pillar Fragment|Upper]] and/or [[#Middle World Pillar Fragment|Middle]] World Pillar fragments can begin. The lead-in sequence [[#To Uldum!|to Uldum]] is available right away as well, although in [[Classic]] mode this has a higher level requirement.

==Upper World Pillar Fragment==
This is the first third of the major Deepholm quests, and sends heroes around the southeast quadrant of the zone.

Once both this and the upper fragments are retrieved, the lower fragment questline becomes available starting with [[The Very Earth Beneath Our Feet]].

As soon as players hit level 83, the [[Uldum quests|Uldum storyline]] opens up inside the faction rooms of the temple.
