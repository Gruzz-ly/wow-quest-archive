==Objectives==
Bring {{NPC||Windspeaker Lorvarius||Lorvarius'}} wind-devil to the clouds of red mist in the [[Crimson Expanse]], near the water, and then return with a sample.
*Gather a sample of the red mist

==Description==
I'm no [[druid]], but some of these mushrooms do not look to be naturally occuring. I know that our [[Stone Lord]] friend {{NPC||Gorsik the Tumultuous||over there}} is eager to blame this on exposure to [[Azeroth]], but I suspect [[Deepholm|more domestic]] causes.

I saw some clouds of red mist to the northeast, near the water's edge. They seemed to be spurring new growth in their wake. Take one of my wind-devils with you and get a sample from those clouds. You may have to stay close to the ground to spot them.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

==Progress==
The fighting at the [[Temple of Earth|temple]] has quieted since you left. Whatever impression you're making, it seems to have helped at least that much.

==Completion==
You let the mist touch your skin? I hope there weren't any adverse side efects.

==Notes==
Fly north close to the ground and look for some red mist, then fly into it. The Red Mist "coats organic creatures in a film that makes them sprout into plant-like creatures over time." It also ticks for 450 to 550 Nature damage every 3 seconds for 30 seconds, increases damage dealt by 50%, and is "quite smelly".
