== Objectives ==
Use the [[Waygate Controller]] to punch in the wrong activation sequence, thereby destroying the Waygate.
*Waygate destroyed

== Description ==
The [[Twilight's Hammer]] must be stopped from using the Waygate. There's only one thing to do.

Punch in the wrong activation sequence and destroy it.

Hmm, let's see. Yes, here's one that opens the explosive depths of the [[Firelands]], the [[elemental plane]] of fire. That should do nicely.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Gateshattering Hauberk|Starscraper Signet}}
You will also receive: {{cost|17|20}}

== Progress ==
Is the Waygate still operational, <name>?

== Completion ==
You did it! You found out what the Twilight's Hammer were up to and you stopped them dead in their tracks!

<Mowi gets up on her tippy toes and gives you a kiss on the cheek.>

Now I'm certain that I have something around here for you.

<She begins rummaging around for your reward.>

== Notes ==
After decrypting the sixth time, this quest is offered automatically. Head back to the southwest and interact with the controls at {{co|39.1|73.9|Deepholm}} to destroy the waygate.

==Progression==
{{To Uldum!}}
