== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Twilight Bloodshaper.png|Twilight Bloodshaper|One of them might lead us to the Forgemaster.}}
Obtain the Twilight Orders from one of the {{NPC||Twilight Bloodshaper}}s at [[Deathwing's Fall]].
*[[Twilight Orders]]

== Description ==
The [[Twilight's Hammer]] are wielding foul magic here, <name>. They animate and energize the remains of {{NPC||Deathwing}}'s blood, so that instead of drying out and disappearing it thrives and becomes more abundant.

Take out one of the bloodshapers, see if they have any clues as to where we can find this "forgemaster".

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

== Progress ==
We must make haste if we're to rebuild the [[World Pillar]], <name>.

== Completion ==
{{questportrait|Maruut Stonebinder.jpg|Maruut Stonebinder|They're keeping slaves here?}}
They're keeping slaves here? We ought to free them regardless, but perhaps they might also aid us in finding the forgemaster.

== Notes ==
Take out a {{NPC||Twilight Bloodshaper}} to loot the Twilight Orders and complete the quest. One can be found on the bridge in the middle of the lava field.

==Progression==
