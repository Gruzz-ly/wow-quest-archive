== Objectives ==
Collect 5 Quartzite Resin.
*[[Quartzite Resin]] x5

== Description ==
This guy's the son of the [[Earthen]] leader! He almost made it to [[Temple of Earth|the temple]] when he got ambushed by more [[rock flayer]]s than I can count!

We know that the {{NPC||Stonefather Oremantle||Earthen Stonefather}} has the middle fragment of the [[World Pillar]]. Maybe if we were to heal his son, the Stonefather would give us the fragment?

My heals won't work on {{NPC||Flint Oremantle||Flint}} here. But if we were to get some of the quartzite resin off of these monsters, I think I can make an explosive compound that will bond and cauterize his wounds. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
It won't take much resin. Those rock flayers are pretty dangerous, though.

== Completion ==
Good thing that I just happen to be a grand master of all things explosively alchemical.

This won't ignite on its own, though.

==Progression==
{{Middle World Pillar Fragment quests}}

== Gain ==
* 34,900 XP
* +250 The [[Earthen Ring]]

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
