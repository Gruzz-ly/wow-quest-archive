:{{text|say|Therazane|And so the "champion" arrives.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|So small. So soft. It's a wonder you've even lasted this long down here, fleshling.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|Or perhaps a testament to your abilities.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|All of this for a piece of the [[World Pillar]]? What exactly do you [[shaman]] intend to do with it?}}
:{{text|say|Earthcaller Torunscar|We came here seal da rift {{NPC||Deathwing}} tore into [[Azeroth]]. We need the World Pillar to repair da hole on dis side.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|And what then? Will you leave [[Deepholm]] to its denizens?}}

:{{text|say|Therazane|I'm glad you're at least that perceptive.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|I propose this: We will march on the [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight cult]] and extinguish any utterings of Deathwing's name from this realm. Your [[Earthen Ring]] will march with us.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|You do this, and I will send {{NPC||Gorsik the Tumultuous||Gorsik}} to the [[Temple of Earth|temple]] with our piece of the World Pillar.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|Seal the rift and leave this place.}}
:{{text|say|Earthcaller Torunscar|We'll be doin' exactly that, then. Ya have our tanks, Stonemother.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|Save your thanks. We march upon the [[Twilight Precipice]] as soon as our forces are gathered. I expect to see you on the battlefield.}}
