Speak to Earthmender Norsala, then kill Fungalmancer Glop.
*Speak to {{NPC||Earthmender Norsala}}
*[[Fungalmancer Glop]] slain

==Description==
Glop had a son. In his grave hubris, he named it Glop. And so the line of [[fungalmancer]]s continues.

I require you to slay this new fungalmancer. Your shaman ally has already returned, and awaits you at his cave in the southwest of [[Verlok Stand]].

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|17|20|}}

==Progress==
To this day, I do not understand how the filthy stone troggs breed so quickly. Perhaps it is better that it is left that way.

==Completion==
Perhaps one day, we shall slay these stone troggs more swiftly than they can breed, and in so doing, end the line of fungalmancers forever.

In time.

==Notes==
