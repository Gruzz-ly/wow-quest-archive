==Objectives==
Go to the [[Jagged Wastes]] and look for signs of worms. They usually kick up lots of dirt as they move around.

* [[Endurite]] (30)
* [[Earthen Thumper]] (provided)

==Description==
The next reagent ya need comes from the bellies of worms that burrow through this realm.

While ya can find plenty o' worms all over, there's a certain type you'll need ta find. They're rarely seen above ground, but there are ways of coaxing 'em out.

Namely making enough racket to piss 'em off! Ha ha! When ya see 'em rumblin' around beneath ya, use this thumper to draw 'em out.

Deliver a killin' blow and get that metal from their wee bellies!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's been a while since I went worm huntin'.

We used ta jump up and down ta rile them up before we made tha thumpers.

==Completion==
Now ya can't say ya didn't have fun throwin' those thumpers around, am I right?! Ha ha!

Good haul you brought in, too. Should be plenty ta work with.

==Notes==
Look for clouds of disturbed rock and dirt and use the provided thumper on those spots to summon [[Endurite Gyreworm]]s and [[Massive Endurite Gyreworm]]s.

==Progression==
{{A Recipe For the Ages}}
