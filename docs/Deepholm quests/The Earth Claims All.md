== Objectives ==
Destroy 5 Deepstone Elementals.
*[[Deepstone Elemental]] slain x5

== Description ==
We're in the [[Deepholm|plane of earth]], <name>. Everything is absorbed by the land eventually.

The [[Storm's Fury Wreckage|Storm's Fury]] will soon be turned to dust and we won't be able to gain any insight from its remains.

Go and destroy the elementals that are dismantling the ship. We're only delaying the inevitable, but we need to buy ourselves time if we're to track down all the pieces of the [[World Pillar]].

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Furyquench Bracers|Stoneshatter Hauberk|Deepstone Treads}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
You've returned, <name>.

== Completion ==
You did what was necessary, <name>. I can tell you're the sort of <class> I'll get along with well.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Gunship Down]] and [[Elemental Energy]] before heading out. The shipwreck is southeast of the temple.
