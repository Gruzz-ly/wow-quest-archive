==Objectives==
Listen to [[Therazane]]'s proposition.

* Hear Therazane's proposal
* Make your choice

==Description==
<You explain that you meant no disrespect to Therazane or to steal their secrets.>

Interesting...

I have a wonderful idea on how to solve this issue. Would you like to hear it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34|}}
*1,790 [[XP]]

==Progress==
To think a creature such as yourself would be freely given our secrets.

I suppose I'll have to keep a closer eye on the goings on within my realm.

==Completion==
Your choice has been made. And an interesting one at that.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Therazane|Typical surface dweller. Only thinking of yourself and how to further your own power.}}

;Ormhun chosen
