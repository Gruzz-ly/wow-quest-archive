==Objectives==
Use the Stormstone at the Twilight Gate and Elemental gate in [[Abyssion's Lair]].
*Twilight Gate disrupted
*Elemental Gate disrupted
*[[Stormstone]] (provided)

==Description==
If we're to have a shot against [[Abyssion]], we must make sure he receives no aid from reinforcements.

You will find two gateways in his lair to the east. Use this stormstone to disrupt their operation.

If everything goes as planned, we'll be able to tackle Abyssion without him being able to receive much assistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

==Progress==
You've returned, <name>. Are the gates closed?

==Completion==
Excellent. When we make our move against Abyssion, we should be able to do so without reinforcements coming to his aid.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Abyssion's Minions]] before heading out. Fly east and start killing to clear paths to the gates on opposite ends of the camp.
