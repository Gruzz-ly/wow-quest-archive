==Objectives==
Speak with [[Examiner Rowe]] at the [[Temple of Earth]] in [[Deepholm]].

==Description==
We have a contingent of the [[Reliquary]] in the chamber just to the northeast inside the temple.

They've been making increasing noises about something that the [[Twilight's Hammer]] is up to.

<name>, would you be a dear and see what they need?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4390 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|10450}} at max level)

==Completion==
Ah, it's about time someone came to speak with us on matters most urgent.

==Notes==
This is an optional breadcrumb to start the [[Uldum quests|Uldum storyline]] as soon as players reach level 83 from inside Deepholm.

==Progression==
{{To Uldum!}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
