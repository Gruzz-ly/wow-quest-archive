==Objectives==
Travel to [[Therazane's Throne]] and speak with [[Therazane the Stonemother]].

==Description==
We must split up. I am still badly wounded from my encounter with [[Geth'xun]], and I don't want to appear weak before the Stonemother. This task falls to you.

Travel to Therazane's Throne and speak to Therazane herself. Find out if she has seen the [[Doomhammer]].

Help her if she asks. She is dangerous and mercurial, but [[Deepholm|this is her realm]], and without her aid we will find nothing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You there! What is this nonsense falling into my domain? Green fire raining from the [[Maelstrom]]! Are you surface dwellers behind this?

<You explain everything to the Stonemother.>

A missing artifact, hm? I have not seen it, but I know where to start. You help the Stonemother, yes, and she will help you.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Thrall|We should meet back up at Therazane's Throne once we know more. Good luck to both of you!}}

Low-level characters have the Summon Air Elemental extra action button available.

;Upon approach
:{{text|say|Therazane|You overreact, [[Terrath]]. Answers will come. Ah, a mortal approaches. Whenever there is trouble, the flesh is not far away, hm?}}

==Progression==
{{Shaman artifact and class hall}}
