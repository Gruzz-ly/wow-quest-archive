==Objectives==
Retrieve a Bag of Verlok Miracle-Grow from the Verloks upon the Crimson Expanse.
* [[Bag of Verlok Miracle-Grow]]

==Description==
The troggs did not disperse after you killed Glop. His servants recovered the growth agent that was left behind and continue to sew the seeds of corruption across the Crimson Expanse.

Hunt them down and recover any of the remaining Verlock Miracle-Grow that you find. It must be disposed of. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60|}} (or {{cost|10|46|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have you done as I've asked of you? We must weed out the whatever growth agent remains within their possession.

==Completion==
Thank you, <race>. We will weed the rest out of their possession in time. 

==Notes==
Pick up [[Soft Rock]] and [[Fungal Fury]] before heading out.

Prior to [[Patch 4.0.6]], the bag was a world object that could be found in the Crimson Expanse rarely but was more commonly found as loot from [[Verlok Shroomtender]]s, [[Verlok Basilisk Rider]]s, or [[Verlok Grubthumper]]s while on the quest. After the patch, these mobs always drop a [[Sprinkle of Verlok Miracle-Grow]] unless they drop the bag itself. Five of these sprinkles can be combined to form a full bag.
