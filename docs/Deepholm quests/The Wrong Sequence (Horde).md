==Objectives==
Use the Waygate Controller to punch in the wrong activation sequence, thereby destroying the Waygate.
* Waygate destroyed

==Description==
The [[Twilight's Hammer]] must be stopped from using the Waygate. There's only one thing to do.

Punch in the wrong activation sequence and destroy it.

Hmm, let's see. Yes, here's one that opens upon the explosive depths of the [[Firelands]], the [[elemental plane]] of fire. That should do nicely.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Gateshattering Hauberk|Starscraper Signet}}
You will also receive: {{cost|17|20}} (or {{cost|20|67}} at max level)

==Progress==
Is the Waygate still operational, <name>?

==Completion==
You did it! Excellent work, <my boy/young lady>. You found out what the Twilight's Hammer were up to and you stopped them dead in their tracks!

<Examiner Rowe pats you on the back with his bony hand.>

Now I'm certain that I have something around here for you.

<He begins rummaging around for your reward.>

{{To Uldum!}}
