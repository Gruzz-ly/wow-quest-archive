== Objectives ==
Rush at least 5 Opalescent Guardians east, out of the [[Pale Roost]].
*{{NPC||Opalescent Guardian}}s Escorted to safety x5

== Description ==
When {{NPC||Deathwing}} came, the [[stone dragon]]s flocked to him. In his absence, they are again without purpose. They swarm and feed upon our kin.

I have bound dozens of Opalescent Guardians, but I am unable to lend them the safety of cover. I need someone more swift, as I suspect you might be.

Lead them by ground towards [[Therazane's Throne]] to the east. Surely, some will not make it, but as long as you keep moving, you should be able to bring several to join our forces there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Did they make it, <class>?

== Completion ==
Well done. Of my main strengths, speed is not one.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|bossemote|Speak to Terrath the Steady when you are ready to begin.}}
The target is a circle of stones guarded by three Opal Stonethrowers east-northeast of the quest giver. Take this opportunity to scout a path, then return to Terrath:

{{gossip|''I am ready to escort a group of elementals across the open.''}}

:{{text|say|Terrath the Steady|Be swift. The stone dragon will not give up easily.}}

At least a dozen elementals spawn and follow the player. Fly. Fly fast. Fly harder than ever before to the circle of stones. The trigger is the big circular stone on the ground. Stand on it and the quest will complete if at least 5 made it. If not, go back and repeat the process.
