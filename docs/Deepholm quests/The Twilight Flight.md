==Objectives==
Defeat Zoltrik Drakebane.
*[[Zoltrik Drakebane]] defeated

==Description==
{{NPC||Terrath the Steady||Terrath}} wants you at the opposite end of the [[Twilight Precipice|precipice]]. He is bringing down the [[twilight dragonflight|twilight flight]] from the skies, and he thinks you will be of aid in killing their leader.

Quite an impression you seem to have made, little one. Have you ever mused that none of this would have happened if I had just stepped on you during [[Imposing Confrontation|our first meeting]]? Fate is a strange thing.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
It is good to see you on the battlefield again.

== Completion ==
It is good that you were here. I find my size to be inhibiting when it comes to dragon riding, strangely.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Stone March]] and [[Therazane's Mercy]] before heading out. Terrath is standing watch at the southeast corner of the precipice. Drakebane is inside the stone building Terrath is looking at. An 83 elite with 244k health. He cannot be pulled to Terrath for his assistance, as Zoltrik will evade before getting to him.

Knock off about 70k health and he'll stun/silence the player, then hop on his drake.
:{{text|say|Zoltrik Drakebane|Ya handle yaself on da ground. How about in da skies?}}
:{{text|yell|Terrath the Steady|The Stone Dragons are here, fleshling. Take wing!}}
:{{text|yell|Zoltrik Drakebane|Ya need ta be more swift den that!}}
:''The stone dragon will take flight following Terrath's dragon at distance. Melee players can leap off their dragon onto his to get in range. Otherwise, nuke him from range. Attack quickly, as Zoltrik takes a trek to the floating rocks near the temple and lands. He will resume attacking the player at that point.''
