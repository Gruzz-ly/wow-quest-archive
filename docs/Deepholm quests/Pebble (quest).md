== Objectives ==
Speak to Pebble in the Shuddering Spires. If you stay on the ground long enough, he should come out of hiding to find you. 

== Description ==
If you hadn't noticed, there's a very small elemental that has taken a liking to you. If you stay on the ground for even a few moments, I'm sure you'll spot him.

You seem to be quite adept at making friends down here. A good talent to have. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||86}}

== Completion ==
<Pebble seems quite happy to meet you.> 

==Notes==
This is a breadcrumb quest that isn't needed to continue the quest chain. Unlike most breadcrumbs, it does not lead to a new location, as Pebble should come straight to the player even before this quest is accepted.
