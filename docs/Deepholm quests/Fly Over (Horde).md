== Objectives ==
Investigate the central area in the back of the [[Twilight Terrace]].
*Masters' Gate Investigated

== Description ==
I'm quite adept at riding my flying carpet. Unfortunately, when I tried to investigate what the cultists had uncovered up at the Masters' Gate, they nearly shot me down.

You look as if you might be skilled with the flying reins as well. Would you mind flying up there to the southwest to see what they've unearthed?

==Progress==
What did you see? What are the Twilight's Hammer doing at the Masters' Gate?

==Completion==
A waygate?! They unearthed a Titan waygate.

This is very interesting and potentially very bad.

== Notes ==
'''Fly Over''' begins the [[Uldum quests|Uldum storyline]] along with [[The Twilight Plot]], available in the [[Temple of Earth]] in [[Deepholm]] as soon as players reach level 83.

Pick up [[The Twilight Plot]] before heading out. Head southwest to the central part of the Twilight Terrace. At {{co|39.0|74.0|Deepholm}} the Twilight's Hammer has unearthed a Waygate!
