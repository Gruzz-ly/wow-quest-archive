==Objectives==
Kill 8 Fungal Behemoths.

==Description==
The corruption of the Crimson Expanse has not subsided. Destroy the Fungal Behemoths that shower their filth upon our realm. If they continue to rise, we will continue to destroy them.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}} (or {{cost|10|46}} at max level)

==Progress==
If they continue to rise, we will continue to destroy them.

==Completion==
Once the growth starts, it is near impossible to stomp back into submission. Through persistence our realm will one day be cleansed. 

==Notes==
Pick up [[Fungal Fury]] and [[Through Persistence]] before heading out as their objectives are all in the same area.
