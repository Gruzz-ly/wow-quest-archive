Use the Explosive Bonding Compound on {{NPC||Flint Oremantle}}.
*[[Explosive Bonding Compound]] applied

==Description==
Alright, take this and apply it to his wounds. If the cauterizing effect of the flash dry explosion doesn't crack him wide open, it should completely heal him.

I think.

==Progress==
Don't yap at me. Use the explosive bonding compound on Flint.

==Completion==
Looks like that did it. He should come to any moment now.

I told you I was a [[grand master]] of [[alchemy]]!

I've got some extra resin leftover. I can make it into all kinds of explosively wonderful stuff. What do you want?
