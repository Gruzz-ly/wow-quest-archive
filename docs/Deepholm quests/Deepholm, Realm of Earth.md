== Objectives ==
Jump on {{NPC||Aggra}}'s [[Wyvern]] and fly into the breach at the [[Maelstrom]]. Once you're on the other side, speak to {{NPC||Maruut Stonebinder}}.

== Description ==
I knew you'd heed our call, <name>. When {{NPC||Deathwing}} was first defeated by the other [[dragon aspect]]s, he retreated to [[Deepholm]], the realm of earth.

Deathwing's return to our world left a rift open between [[Azeroth]] and Deepholm.

If we don't mend the breach, this land will be torn asunder.

We're doing our best to contain the damage on this side of the rift. Aggra will take you through the rift so you can help repair the damage from the other side.

Get on her wyvern when you're ready.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Completion ==
You've arrived just in time, <name>. All our resources are tied up keeping the rift stable.

We need someone like you to help us recover the fragments of the [[World Pillar]].

== Notes ==
After hopping on:
:{{text|say|Aggra|I hope you have a strong stomach. Traveling through the breach is not for the weak.}}
:{{text|say|Aggra|We're at the center of the Maelstrom, the rift between Deepholm and Azeroth. Watch as it threatens to tear our world apart!}}
:{{text|say|Aggra|Let us hope Thrall and the others can contain it while you're inside.}}
:{{text|yell|Aggra|This it it! Brace yourself!}}
:''The wyvern dives through the breach!''
:{{text|say|Aggra|You made it! Good!}}
:{{text|say|Aggra|This is the [[Temple of Earth]]. It's the most important structure in Deepholm.}}
:{{text|say|Aggra|There was once a [[Titan]]-made stone inside. It was known as the [[World Pillar]]. The name was literal. It bore the weight of all the elemental and magnetic forces in Deepholm.}}
:{{text|say|Aggra|It was shattered when Deathwing broke through the dome above and created the rift between the two worlds. All of Deepholm is going to collapse into Azeroth if we do not put the World Pillar back together.}}
:{{text|say|Aggra|The first fragment was going to be delivered to us by a Horde gunship known as the ''[[Storm's Fury Wreckage|Storm's Fury]].'' It never made it here.}}
:{{text|say|Aggra|We've taken control of the temple and we're containing as much of the damage as we can. Go inside and speak to Maruut; he's in charge.}}
: ''Aggra drops the player off at the temple entrance and flies off.''
:{{text|say|Aggra|We are all counting on you.}}
