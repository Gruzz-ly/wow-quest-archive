==Objectives==
Speak with [[Therazane]] in [[Deepholm]].
* Deepholm portal taken

==Description==
In order to unite the four [[Elemental Lord]]s of [[Azeroth]], you will need to seek out Therazane and convince her to join the cause of Azeroth.

However, the Stonemother currently has her hands full battling a [[Twilight's Hammer]] resurgence in Deepholm.

If we lend Therazane our aid she may agree to unite with the [[Earthen Ring]] against the [[Burning Legion]].

Journey to [[Therazane's Throne]] in the heart of Deepholm. Aid her in defeating the Twilight's Hammer and convince her to join the defense of Azeroth!

==Completion==
The Earthen Ring has come to offer help? This is unexpected... but welcome, nonetheless.

==Notes==
Take the [[Deepholm Portal]] by the puzzle area. In [[Therazane's Throne]], [[Farseer Nobundo]], accompanied by [[Stormcaller Mylra]] and two [[Earthen Ring Shaman]], is speaking Therazane.
