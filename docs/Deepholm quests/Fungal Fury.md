==Objectives==
Destroy 10 of the newly sprouted mushrooms in the [[Crimson Expanse]].

==Description==
Something upon the Crimson Expanse continues to spur disgusting growths upon the rock. New fungi are rising, and they need to be crushed before they can spread.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}} (or {{cost|10|46}} at max level)

==Progress==
See to it that no further corruption spreads.

==Completion==
You are proficient at stepping on things. You would make an excellent giant. 

==Notes==
Make sure to pick up [[Soft Rock]] and [[Through Persistence]] before heading out as they all have objectives in the same area.

The achievement [[Fungal Frenzy]] can be obtained during the process of completing this daily quest. Suffer the effects of a Poolstool, Shuffletruffle, Shrinkshroom and Trapcap simultaneously. See that article for more information and strategy.
