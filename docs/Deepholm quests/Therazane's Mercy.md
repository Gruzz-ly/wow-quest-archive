== Objectives ==
Defeat Boldrich Stonerender and High Priestess Lorthuna.
*[[Boldrich Stonerender]] defeated
*[[High Priestess Lorthuna]] defeated

== Description ==
There are two leaders among the [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight]] that need to be killed.

One is a [[human]] by the name of Boldrich. Small, as you are. But still dangerous, as you also are.

The other is a priestess by the name of Lorthuna. She is wily and hard to corner. Strike swiftly and do not let her escape, or I promise you, you will regret it later.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Lorthuna's Broken Shackles|Rune-Scribed Gauntlets|Stonerender Drape}}
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
You have not yet completed the task that I set upon you - I have no further words to offer you.

== Completion ==
You let Lorthuna escape? I warned you of this.

Still, their forces are shattered and their resources cut of. There is little they can do to me or my allies.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Stone March]] and [[The Twilight Flight]] before heading out. Boldrich is at the southwest corner of the precipice, in front of a large stone building.

:{{text|say|Boldrich Stormrender|Twilight shall fall upon you! Even in this deep dark hole.}}
:{{text|say|Boldrich Stonerender|Agh...}}

The high priestess is on the second floor of the large building near the center of camp. She is an 83 elite with 161k HP. She melees for upwards of 2000 damage on cloth, has the Shadow Fissure ability, and a [[Shadowstep]]-like, called Shadowstride. It is necessary to get the tap on her to get credit for her defeat.

:{{text|say|High Priestess Lorthuna|Therazane's finally gathered the nerve to challenge us, has she?}}
:{{text|say|High Pirestess Lorthuna|You do realize there's no hope, don't you? Deathwing has already risen. Your world is doomed.}}

At 33%:
:{{text|say|High Priestess Lorthuna|I'm not that easy, hon. Perhaps another time.}}
:''Lorthuna returns to her spawn location and teleports away.''

Complete [[The Twilight Flight]] before Therazane will offer the conclusion.
