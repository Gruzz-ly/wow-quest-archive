==Objectives==
Recover 10 Motes of Painite.
* [[Painite Mote]] x10

==Description==
Some of the rarest crystals form in the most dangerous places. In the Crumbling Depths, you will find painite formations - much better than the gold that your races cherish so much.

As a being of flesh and a being of small stature, you can enter the Crumbling Depths to retrieve motes of painite for me. Would you undergo that danger on my behalf?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60|}} (or {{cost|10|46|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Painite is one of the most valuable materials to us, particularly due to our inability to reach most of the deposits on our own. 

==Completion==
Well done, <race>. These will do well. 

==Notes==
Do this quest with [[Beneath the Surface]], [[Fear of Boring]] and [[Lost In The Deeps]].
