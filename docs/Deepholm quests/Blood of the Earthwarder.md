== Objectives ==
Gather 5 samples of Blood of Neltharion from {{NPC||Living Blood}} at [[Deathwing's Fall]].
*[[Blood of Neltharion]] x5

== Description ==
When {{NPC||Deathwing}} escaped to [[Deepholm]], his corruption was extreme, but perhaps not absolute.

The [[Twilight's Hammer|cultists]] at Deathwing's Fall harvest and shape the corrupted blood he left behind into living organisms to draw from their power.

What if a trace of the Earthwarder's essence remains? After all, Neltharion was the [[dragon aspect|aspect]] of earth before he was the aspect of death.

Gather samples from the living blood the cultists have created and we'll see if any traces of the Earthwarder remain.

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Blood-Collector Helm|Redblood Belt|Sanguinary Bracers}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
You return, <name>. Did you obtain the blood?

== Completion ==
There is still great power present in this blood, <name>. I can sense it even now.

Yet there is also much corruption. I am not sure we can salvage the Earthwarder's essence from this.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Deathwing's Fall]] before heading out. There are plenty of Living Blood along the [[Blood Trail]] between the Temple of Earth and Deathwing's Fall. Collect 5 and quickly circle back to turn in before heading all the way out to Deathwing's Fall.
