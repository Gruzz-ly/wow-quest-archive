Go to [[Deathwing's Fall]] in [[Deepholm]].
*Deathwing's Fall reached

== Description ==
The [[Twilight's Hammer]] involvement in the disappearance of the [[World Pillar]] fragment makes complete sense. Let us hope that we can act swiftly enough to recover it.

<{{NPC||Maruut Stonebinder||Maruut}} places his hand on your shoulder.>

I've established a spiritual bond with you. We should be able to communicate while you remain in Deepholm.

Go to Deathwing's Fall to the southeast and investigate the Twilight's Hammer operation there.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|6|20}}

== Progress ==
Yes, <name>?

== Completion ==
{{questportrait|Maruut Stonebinder.jpg|Maruut Stonebinder|They must've brought the fragment here!}}
This must be where the world pillar fragment was brought. Let's have a closer look.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Blood of the Earthwarder]] before heading out. This is the first remote turn-in quest in [[Deepholm]]. An additional pane appears off to the right of the quest pane with an image of whoever is talking to the player or the target of the quest and some bonus text beneath it. The bonus text is listed here inside both parentheses and quote marks.

Deathwing's Fall is to the northeast of the [[Storm's Fury Wreckage]]. Fly into the Deathwing's Fall subzone to complete the quest.
