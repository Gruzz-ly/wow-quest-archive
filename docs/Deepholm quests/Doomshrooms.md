== Objectives ==
Destroy 10 Doomshrooms.
*[[Doomshroom]]s destroyed x10

== Description ==
The rift to [[Azeroth|your world]] has poisoned [[Deepholm|our home]]. Corrupted it. Polluted it.

This expanse festers and grows. It becomes difficult to even see the purity of the rock beneath this filth.

If you are here to lend your aid, then go about cleansing this overgrowth. Look for the brightly glowing mushrooms that are growing faster than the others. They are the worst of the offenders.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
I am not yet convinced that you have more value than the filth I have sent you to cleanse.

== Completion ==
You have appealed to {{NPC||Diamant the Patient||Diamant}}. He is patient. Trusting. Perhaps too much so. You have much to prove if you wish my favor, <race>.

Still, this is a start.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Gone Soft]] and [[Familiar Intruders]] before heading out. Go north, killing. Complete the Familiar Intruders chain (all of three quests) to resume with [[Shaken and Stirred]] and [[Corruption Destruction]].

==Progression==
