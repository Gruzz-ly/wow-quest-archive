'''The Twilight Plot''' begins the [[Uldum quests|Uldum storyline]] along with [[Fly Over (Alliance)|Fly Over]], available in the [[Temple of Earth]] in [[Deepholm]] as soon as players reach level 83.

== Objectives ==
Collect the Masters' Gate Plans.
*[[Masters' Gate Plans]]

== Description ==
We came here to investigate rumors of a [[Titan]] artifact on the [[Masters' Gate]] to the southwest.

One of those [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists must have the plans for what they're doing up there. You're going to have to get them for us, <name>.

Keep searching the cultists until you find them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Those plans are the key to everything.

== Completion ==
<Mowi takes a look at the plans that you hand to her.>

But... but, this is just gibberish!

What does this even say? What language is that?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Fly Over]] before heading out. Kill twilights and find the twilight plans.

==Progression==
{{To Uldum!}}
