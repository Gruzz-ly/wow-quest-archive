==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Boden the Imposing.jpg||Sometimes it's hard to not be looked down upon.}}
Read the Earthen Ring Proclamation to Boden the Imposing.
*Seak Peace with [[Boden the Imposing]]
*[[Earthen Ring Proclamation]] (provided)

==Description==
Have ya seen the looming giant in the distance to the northeast? Dat is Boden the Imposing, one of [[Therazane]] the Stonemother's [[Stone Lords]].

We be knowin' little of da Stone Lords, but Boden is not known ta be very level-headed. Sadly, he seems to be da one leadin' dis assault, so he's the one we must be confrontin'.

Take dis proclamation to him and read it aloud on behalf of da [[Earthen Ring]]. I know it be a bit of a stretch to think words will settle dis, but we have to try. Be cautious. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Trustworthy Cowl|Firm Grips|Insignia of Diplomacy}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|60}}

==Progress==
Did ya confront Boden yet?

==Completion==
Yeah, mon... dat's about the reaction we were expectin'.

He mentioned [[Diamant the Patient|Diamant]] though? If da two don't get along, perhaps this Diamant be a bit less brash den Boden. At least it's somethin'.

Let me see if I can get da earth to tell me where we might be findin' dis Diamant. 

==Notes==
Fly northwest. One would think a huge stone giant would be hard to miss in a mostly open-space field, but... Once in range of him, land, then use the proclamation:
:{{text|say|<Player>|Boden the Imposing. I come on behalf of the Earthen Ring. We wish your kind no harm. We seek to repair the rift between our worlds. Why do you attack us?}}
:{{text|yell|Boden the Imposing|Hah! Did you mistake me for [[Diamant the Patient|Diamant]], <race>? Or perhaps some whimpering, complaint [[stone trogg]] who cares?}}
:{{text|yell|Boden the Imposing|If you seek peace, relinquish the [[World Pillar]] and leave [[Deepholm]]. This is our realm. Your only welcome here shall be found underneath my stone foot.}}
:''Boden stomps, knocking the player back halfway across the map.''
