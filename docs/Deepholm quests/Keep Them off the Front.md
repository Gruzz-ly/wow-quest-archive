== Objectives ==
Bombard 30 {{NPC||Fungal Terror}}s and/or {{NPC||Stone Trogg Reinforcement||Trogg Reinforcements}}.
*Reinforcements bombarded x30

== Description ==
Oh good, you brought another catapult with you. {{NPC||Clay Mudaxle||Clay}} might be older than dirt, but he makes a mean war machine.

Well, you didn't bring it all the way out here for your health, flesh bag. Get in one of those things and bombard the fungal terrors and reinforcements steaming out of [[Needlerock Slag]].

We have to keep them off the front!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
Get back in a catapult and put those things back in the ground. The line's barely holding!

== Completion ==
That's a great start, <name>, but we're going to need you to fly over into the town and stir up some trouble.

== Notes ==
Hop in. The catapult has one ability, seen earlier in [[Close Escort]]:
*{{abilities|Fire Catapult|range=100|Fires an exploding geode round at the Stone Trogg Reinforcements and Fungal Terrors out to 100 yards.|notes=Instant}}
The shells hit for upward of 43,000 damage, so unload. Killing 30 will automatically drop the player out of the catapult.
