==Objectives==
Use the Delicate Chain Smasher to release 6 Quartz Rocklings.
*[[Quartz Rockling]] released x6
*[[Delicate Chain Smasher]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight Cultists]] are taking my rocklings among them. They drain and torture them. Strip them of the very essence that animates them from the stone.

Please, <race>, free my rocklings. Neither [[Diamant the Patient|Diamant]] nor [[Quartz Stonetender|I]] have the delicacy to smash their chains without hurting them as well. But we do have  a tool you might use.

Use this. Break their chains and set them free.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

==Progress==
It's unberable to watch. They know no mercy. They should be offered none.

==Completion==
You are a generous <race>. You give back to the earth that offers you so much. You have my respect. You shall surely have the respect of the Stone Lords with time.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Hatred Runs Deep]] and [[Unsolid Ground]] before heading out. While killing cultists, there are neutral mini-giants all over the camp. Use the Delicate Chain Smasher on them to free them.
