== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Diamant the Patient.jpg||Diamant the Patient. The Timeless. The Long-Winded.}}
Return to {{NPC||Diamant the Patient||Diamant}} at [[Lorthuna's Gate]] with the Painite Chunk.
*[[Painite Chunk]] (provided)

== Description ==
<The ground trembles slightly, and the low, familiar voice of {{NPC||Diamant the Patient||Diamant}} speaks as if from the stone itself.>

You've done as I asked.

Turn back and escape the cave in one piece.

Don't forget the gemstone.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Helm of the Wormslayer|Gyreworm Waistguard|Insignia of the Earthen Lord}}

== Progress ==
You're alive. This is good.

Is the gemstone with you?

== Completion ==
Well done, fleshling!

The [[gyreworm]]s are among our most dangerous enemies.

The other [[Stone Lords]] shall have trouble not turning their head to this accomplishment.

== Notes ==
Get out and run. After clearing the [[Scoured Reach]], swap to a flying mount and return to Diamant.

Completing this quest bumps players up to {{reputation|Friendly}} with the [[Therazane (faction)|Therazane]] faction. {{NPC||Therazane}} herself comes by to check in!
:{{text|say|Therazane|Is this the one you're wasting your time with, Diamant?}}
:{{text|say|Diamant the Patient|Not wasted, Stonemother. It has been very useful.}}
:{{text|say|Diamant the Patient|It stands to reason that it may be here for exactly the reasons it says it is.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|Then you take responsibility for its actions, Stone Lord. You will be the one answering to me when it shows its true intent.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|And you, fleshling, consider for a moment that you are entirely surrounded by rock in this place. The very earth you walk on bends to my will.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|If you betray us, there will be no escape for you. I will crush your body so slowly that you shall hear every single one of your bones break.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|I'm glad we had this talk.}}
:{{text|say|Diamant the Patient|You still have much to prove. But you've brought the stone. That is an excellent start.}}
:{{text|say|Diamant the Patient|The other Stone Lords have already heard my words.}}
:{{text|say|Diamant the Patient|They should show you a degree of trust.}}
:{{text|say|Diamant the Patient|At least enough so that you can prove yourself.}}
:{{text|say|Diamant the Patient|Take this signet as a testament of my good will. I pray that my trust is not misplaced.}}
Additionally, the siege upon the [[Temple of Earth]] has ceased. Huzzah!
