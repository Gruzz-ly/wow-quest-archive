*{{NPC||Agitated Tunneler}} lured

== Description ==
The [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight Cult]] are mining [[jade]] crystals near their camp.

Foolish...

Reckless...

Gather the mined crystals. Take them to the center of their camp. Shatter them against the ground.

The reverberations and the powered crystal will bring the tunnelers upon them.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

== Progress ==
They will learn respect for the earth...

Piece by piece.

Rock by rock...

...with time.

== Completion ==
Time brings respect to all.

The smallest pebble.

The largest mountain.

The most stubborn cultist.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Hatred Runs Deep]] and [[Loose Stones]] before heading out. While killing cultists, there are jade crystal fragments everywhere. Collect six, then combine them. Use it to summon a rockworm. Then run like hell.
