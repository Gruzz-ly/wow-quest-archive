==Objectives==
Speak with [[Aggra]] when you are ready to help [[Thrall]]. Then defeat the [[Element of Patience|Elements of Patience]] and [[Corestone of Patience|Corestones of Patience]] that are holding him captive.
*Help Thrall break out of his stone prison

==Description==
[[File:Thrall's Patience TCG.jpg|thumb|Thrall's Patience.]]
With the [[Therazane|Stonemother's]] Blessing, I can take us to where Go'el is being held.

We must be careful. The [[Twilight's Hammer]] has agents all around. You help me hold them off while I attempt to get through to Go'el!

Speak with me when you are ready, and I will take you to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*86750 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|206700}} at max level)
*+350 [[reputation]] with the [[Earthen Ring]]

==Progress==
We are nearly there, <name>. Stay by my side a bit longer. We will get through to him yet.

==Completion==
<Aggra clenches her fists, and stares at the spot where Thrall stood moments ago.>

==Notes==
Speak to Aggra again:
:The sooner we can get away from the Stonemother, the better. I do not trust her.
:{{gossip|''Aggra, I am ready. Let us go to Thrall.''}}

Aggra and the player will then travel southeast through the [[Twilight Precipice]] to reach the [[Staidridge]], just to the northeast of [[Deathwing's Fall]] via the [[Path of Earth (buff)|Path of Earth]]. On the way there, Aggra says the following:
<poem>
{{Text|Say|Aggra|Know this, friend: you have my deepest thanks. Your courage, your strength... you...

You remind me of him.}}
</poem>

On the Twilight Precipice overlooking the Staidridge:
<poem>
{{Text|Say|Aggra|There! Look at him - frozen in stone, unmoving. Unfeeling. That look on his face... the resolve, the stubbornness. He gets it when he digs his heels in.}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|I've seen it before - in Nagrand when he refused to lay down his mantle of Warchief, and again during his training.}}
</poem>

Upon reaching Thrall's location:
<poem>
{{Text|Say|Aggra|I should have known! The Twilight's Hammer knew we'd be here! Defend yourself!}}
</poem>

As before, a progress bar appears. Kill elementals to free Thrall.
