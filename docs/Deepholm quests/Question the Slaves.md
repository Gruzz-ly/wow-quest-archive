== Objectives ==
Obtain the [[Twilight Slaver's Key]] and free 6 {{NPC||Enslaved Miner}}s.
* Enslaved miner freed x6

According to the orders you found, there is a key inside the tent in the southeastern end of [[Deathwing's Fall]].

Obtain it and free the slaves in the quarry to the south.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Bondbreaker Gauntlets|Rough Stone Carapace|Lockbreaker Shank}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
What have we discovered?

== Completion ==
Let us find this journal. We're getting close to the World Pillar fragment, I can sense it.

== Notes ==
Southeast corner of the area, on the north side of the lava pit is a tent. Just inside at {{co|62.8|59.5|Deepholm}} is the Slavemaster's Coffer, which has the Twilight Slaver's key. From there, keep heading southwest to reach the quarry. Interact with the Ball and Chain to free the slave. Free six to automatically complete the quest.

#{{text|say|Enslaved Miner|Ah, yes... I know about the forgemaster! I just overheard that he's not in the camp right now.}}
#{{text|say|Enslaved Miner|The forgemaster is meeting with the Twilight leadership. Trust me, I traded some gossip for a loaf of stale bread!}}
#{{text|say|Enslaved Miner|I don't know nothin' bout no forgemaster. Now tell me where this safe place you came from is!}}
#{{text|say|Enslaved Miner|I heard the forgemaster keeps notes about his meetings in a book at the tower overlooking the camp.}}
