==Objectives==
Use the Elementium Grapple Line to pull 3 Servants of Therazane off of their feet.
*[[Servant of Therazane]] brought down (3)
*[[Elementium Grapple Line]] (provided)

==Description==
We're fortunate dat those giants be havin' such bad aim. Luck is sure to be favorin' dem eventually though.

We need to get dem off da battlefield, but I don't tink takin' dem head on would be very smart.

Take dis grapplin' line, get a good hold on one of their ankles and pull their legs out from under dem. Once dey are on da ground, dey should be easy ta be finishin' off.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|60}}

==Progress==
Did it work, mon?

==Completion==
Dat will slow their assault a bit while [[Earthmender Norsala|Norsala]] be findin' a way to calm'm. We've no desire ta be remainin' enemies of [[Therazane]] the Stonemother.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Crumbling Defenses]] and [[Core of Our Troubles]] before heading out. Don't focus on killing giants. Focus on saving the shaman. Then kill giants once the shaman are saved.

Get within 10-15 yards of a servant then toss the grapple, which can be used while mounted:
:{{text|bossemote|The line is secured to his ankle. Pull away to trip him!}}
Do so. It won't interrupt the channel. Getting dropped will knock off a good half of the giant's health. Then, an Earthguard Sentinel will spawn to help finish the servant off:
*{{text|say|Earthguard Sentinel|Need a hand?}}
*{{text|say|Earthguard Sentinel|That's more like it.}}
The Sentinels often cast their own quite effective version of [[Bloodlust]], benefiting allies around them including the player.

The quest does not actually require killing the giants, only bringing them down.
