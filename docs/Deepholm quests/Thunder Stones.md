==Objectives==
Collect 12 Thunder Stones.
*[[Thunder Stone]] (12)

==Description==
To the north lies the [[Fractured Front]]. That is where most of the heavy fighting is happening.

Go into Stonehearth proper and grab all of the thunder stones that you can. Our engineers need them for the catapults.

When you have enough, take them to [[Clay Mudaxle]]. Don't mind his tongue. He's old and cranky, and should have gone back into the earth thousands of years ago.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

==Progress==
<The older Earthen has cracks where the others do not and dust occasionally falls off him.>

What are you supposed to be? Some kind of fleshy mistake? [[Curse of Flesh|Cursed]] is what you are!

<Clay spits dust.>

Make yourself useful or get off of my front!

==Completion==
<Clay grumbles to himself.>

Those'll do. Just put them down over there.

<The Earthen looks you up and down with one eye then spits dust onto the ground.>

I'm going to have something you can do in just a moment. Maybe.

==Notes==
Finish up [[Stonefather's Boon]] and pick up [[Sealing the Way]] before heading out. Plenty of geodes in the town. Collect 12 while sealing the four buildings, then head north-northwest along the path to the fractured battlefront.
