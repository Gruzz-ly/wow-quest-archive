== Objectives ==
Slay 12 Stone Trogg Ambushers.
*[[Stone Trogg Ambusher]] slain x12

== Description ==
Our war has been waged for longer than your kind counts time. Let us see if you can make a difference, <race>.

The [[stone trogg]]s are a mistake of the [[titan]]s. On [[Azeroth|your world]], they have succumbed to the [[Curse of Flesh]]. But here, in [[Deepholm]], you see them in their true form.

We're surrounded here. Maybe you could go out there and break a few troggs down for us. See what they're really made of?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
Are you going to pull your fleshy weight, <race>?

== Completion ==
Not a bad start, though you'll have to destroy more of them than that if you're going to rescue the Stonefather.

A lot more.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Stonefather's Boon]] before heading out.
