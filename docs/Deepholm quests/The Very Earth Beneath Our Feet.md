== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Earthcaller Torunscar}} just nothwest of the [[Temple of Earth]], in the Jagged Wastes.

== Description ==
Only one piece of the [[World Pillar]] remains, and it is in the hands of the {{NPC||Therazane||Stonemother}} herself. Worse, the temple has come under siege by [[elemental]]s and [[giant]]s. It's not a terrible leap of logic to assume they're acting by her will.

Go out and meet the elements in battle to the northwest. With with Torunscar and {{NPC||Earthmender Norsala||Norsala}} to find a way to communicate with their leaders and seek out the World Pillar. We would prefer such be done peacefully, but we will do whatever we must to seal the rift.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||86}}

== Completion ==
Hey, mon! Thank ya for comin'

We weren't ready for dis kind of attack. We been expectin' da [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight Cult]], but not elementals... we've no idea what upset dem so much that dey would turn on us like this.

You haven't been out dere killin' them, have you?

== Notes ==
Exit the temple and circle up to the northwest of it. Torunscar and Norsala are there, fighting off elementals of Therazane's forces.
