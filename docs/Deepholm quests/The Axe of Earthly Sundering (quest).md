==Objectives==
Slay 5 Sundered Emerald Colossi.
*[[Sundered Emerald Colossus]] slain (5)
*[[The Axe of Earthly Sundering]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Emerald Colossus|emerald colossi]] are the greatest of the [[Therazane|Stone Mother]]'s creatures. They must be the first to be removed from [[Quaking Fields|the field]].

I brought Stonefather Oremantle's axe for just this task. Use it to sunder the giants.

That should bring them down to a more manageable size so that you can finish them off.

==Rewards==
{{itembox
|You will receive: 
|Size-Cutting Bracers}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|20}}

==Progress==
We need more of those giants destroyed, <name>.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Without their giants, Therazane's forces will have a harder time taking Stonehearth.

Now, if you please, hand back the axe. I'll keep it safe until you can rescue the Stonefather.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Elemental Ore]] before heading out.
