==Objectives==
Use the Spirit Totem on the corpses of 6 Slain Crew Members.
*[[Slain Crew Member]] information x6
*[[Spirit Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
Something's wrong here, <name>.

The ship's crew has been slain. Yet there is no bloodshed or damage to the ship's structure.

This was not the [[Horde]]'s doing.

We will find the answers we seek by speaking to the spirits of the dead. They have not yet left this world.

Take this totem and place it near the corpses of the fallen. You will have a few seconds to listen to their last few thoughts.

Beware, however! There is no telling how the spirits of the dead will react to our prodding.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Incorporeal Sandals|Skyrend Bracers|Totem-Caller Hood}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|20}}

==Progress==
The spirits always have something to say to those who will listen.

==Completion==
We were bound to run into the [[Twilight's Hammer]] sooner or later, <name>. If they're behind this, it's quite likely that the [[World Pillar]] fragment is in their possession.

==Notes==
This quest name could be a reference the the song "All My Friends Are Dead" by Turbonegro.
