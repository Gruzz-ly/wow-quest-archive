==Objectives==
Recover an Enormous Ruby Crystal Cluster.
*[[Ruby Crystal Cluster]]

==Description==
Among the other precious gemstones hidden deep out of our reach in the Crumbling Depths, there are enormous ruby crystal clusters. They are infused with terrible energy.

It will not be easy to obtain such a thing, for they are well guarded. But you, you are stubborn and brave. I think this is something you can do.

Within the Crumbling Depths, look to where the tunnels end abruptly in stone. The clusters are found in those passages when they are to be found at all. Should you find one, return to me.

==Rewards==

You will receive: {{cost|8|60|}} (or {{cost|10|46|}} at max level)

==Progress==
These crystals are of great value, particularly to Gorsik. I shall have a heavy sway over him if I come into possession of one. I wish this to be so. 

==Completion==
This is exactly what I was seeking. Thank you, <race>. 

==Notes==
*Despite dismounting you from your flying mount on entering the tunnels, you can still use your ground mount.
*The ruby crystal clusters are found at the end of dead end tunnels.  You can find them easily by checking your minimap, they appear as a skull on the map.  Clicking the ruby crystal clusters will spawn a level 83 Enormous Gyreworm with 107k HP that will drop the quest item when killed.
