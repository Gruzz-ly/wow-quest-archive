==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Magmatooth.jpg|Magmatooth|Goldmine said it was okay to get his Burning Heart, so I guess it's okay....}}
Obtain The Burning Heart.
*[[The Burning Heart]]
*[[Goldmine's Fire Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
Alright, we need something that's going to make the compound go, "Boom"!

I'm all out of gun powder, but I think I know what we can use instead... the heart of my [[fire elemental]]!

Here, take my fire totem east to the [[Blood Trail]]. Just flip the switch on it near any of the lava pools over there and [[Magmatooth]] should be summoned. Bring back his heart and we'll be in business.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

==Progress==
You have the heart yet?

==Completion==
Uh oh. Sounds like he wasn't very happy about the situation. How was I to know? I'm just an initiate after all.

Anyway, I'll worry about Magmatooth later.

''On complete:''
:{{text|say|Initiate Goldmine|Eureka!}}

==Notes==
Head east, just past the temple and stand in one of the glowing red pools, then use the fire totem.
:{{text|yell|Magmatooth|Deepholm? I hate this plane. Wait... you're not {{NPC||Initiate Goldmine}}!}}
:{{text|yell|Magmatooth|I know what you're after. I can sense it!}}
:{{text|yell|Magmatooth|This is not in my contract! Die, <race>!}}
On death:
:{{text|yell|Magmatooth|NOOOOOO! You tell Goldmine he's a dead goblin! Our contract is over!}}
