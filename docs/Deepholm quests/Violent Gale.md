== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Felsen the Enduring}} and follow his instruction towards the entrance to the [[Crumbling Depths]].

== Description ==
There is a task that I can set before you.

It is a dangerous task. Completing it will help impress the more stubborn [[Stone Lord]]s.

To the west is the [[Scoured Reach]]. Severe winds batter the rock. It will be difficult to fly there.

Within the Scoured Reach are [[Gyreworm]]s. They devour rock and move through it as if it were water. They could do the same thing to our rocky skin.

Find Felsen the Enduring. Have him direct you to the Crumbling Depths. {{NPC||Diamant the Patient||I}} will speak to you once you get that far.

== Completion ==
<The ground rumbles slightly as you approach the cave. This looks to be the entrance that Diamant and Felsen spoke of.>

== Notes ==
Fly northeast. Felsen is a level 83 elite stone giant attached to the [[Therazane (faction)|Therazane]] faction. Fly close to him:
:{{text|say|Felsen the Enduring|You've come to prove yourself, fleshling? The Crumbling Depths lie northeast. The stone you seek is within.}}
Keep clear of the moving dust clouds&mdash;they're submurged Gyreworms! Also keep clear of the Gorged Gyreworms up on the surface too...

Head toward the Colossal Gyreworm's hole. There, at {{co|58.2|25.7|Deepholm}} the quest automatically completes.
