== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Terrath the Steady}} at the [[Pale Roost]].

== Description ==
Nearby to the north, you will find Terrath the Steady. He has taken upon the task of pulling the [[stone dragon]]s back into the fold. We find ourselves repeating this trial every few hundred years... the stone dragons are fickle, and bend only to strength.

Terrath is balanced and reasonable, but his goals may not be easily accomplished. Go to him. Appeal to the more balanced side of the {{NPC||Therazane||Stonemother}}.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|2|15}}

== Completion ==
Greetings, <race>. I have been told of your coming. If you wish to aid me, then perhaps I can be of aid to you as well.

== Notes ==
Fly to the north-northeast. Dodge the big, hostile dragons. Terrath's gossip:
:When the {{NPC||Deathwing||Earthwarder}} began to recover, he became ill content with the quiet. It was not long before he turned the [[stone dragon]]s upon us.
:With Deathwing gone, they are without purpose again. We can remind them of our strength. Bring them back to the {{NPC||Therazane||Earthmother}}.
