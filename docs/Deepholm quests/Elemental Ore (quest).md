== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Elemental Ore.
*[[Elemental Ore]] x6

== Description ==
You're going to have to deal with the leader of [[Therazane]]'s forces here. However, to get you to him quickly and safely, I'm going to need to perform a ritual.

Go out into [[Quaking Fields|the field]] and collect elemental ore from the {{NPC||Jade Rager||ragers}}. With enough of it, I should be able to make you one with the ground to learn what we need.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
Have you all that is required?

== Completion ==
This should do. I'll just need a moment to prepare the ritual.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Axe of Earthly Sundering]] before heading out. Then go kill {{NPC||Jade Rager}}s.

==Progression==
