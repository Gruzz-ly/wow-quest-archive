==Objectives==
Rescue 6 Stone Drakes in the [[Pale Roost]] by defeating the [[trogg]]s that torment them.
* [[Stone Drake]]s Rescued (6)

==Description==
When [[Geth'xun|that demon of yours]] fell into [[Deepholm|my realm]] he must have done something to the [[trogg]]s. They were never a threat to my beloved [[stone drake]]s before.

Now they're loose all over the Pale Roost, subduing drakes on the ground. Put a stop to this insult at once, and free those drakes! They may be of use to us later.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What of my precious little drakes, hm?

==Completion==
Very very good, shaman. The cavern is once more filled with their delightful wails.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Therazane|Oh how lovely, lovely! The clutch is safe. Join me back at my throne. I know where to find your hammer - and the stone dragons are now free to help.}}

To free the drakes, simply kill the troggs that are channeling magic into them.
