== Objectives ==
Slay any 12 [[stone trogg]]s on the [[Fractured Battlefront]].
*Fractured Battlefront stone troggs slain x12

== Description ==
I want you to go out there and I want you to finish them.

{{NPC||Stone Trogg Berserker||Berserkers}}, {{NPC||Stone Trogg Earthrender||Earthrenders}}, {{NPC||Needlerock Deathrider||Deathriders}}... I don't care. I want those stone troggs shattered!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
I need you to shatter a few more, <name>

== Completion ==
That's a good dent, but it's clear to me that we're going to have to handle this a slightly different way.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Battlefront Triage]] and [[Fixer Upper]] before heading out. Deathriders are [[death knight]]s, who open with [[Death Grip]]!

==Progression==
{{Middle World Pillar Fragment quests}}
