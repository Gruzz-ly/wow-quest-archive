==Objectives==
Slay 25 Felrock Troggs in the [[Pale Roost]].
* [[Felrock]] [[Stone trogg|Trogg]]s Slain (25)

==Description==
"[[Demon]]s" you say? A "[[Burning Legion]]?" Hrmph! Nothing burns here but for my ire, [[shaman]], and if these monsters think to corrupt [[Deepholm|my domain]], they will be crushed beneath my dainty beautiful feet!

I have not seen [[Doomhammer|this hammer of yours]], but the stone troggs witnessed everything that fell from the sky. Moreover, they've been running amok in the [[Pale Roost]] ever since the [[Fel|green fire]] landed near their home.

Be a dear and lay waste to the Felrock Troggs west of here. Perhaps you can get one of them to talk.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well? Have you given them a solid thrashing?

==Completion==
Troggs. So tiresome. Pebbles for brains. Easily swayed by any cult, demon, or [[dragon]] that tries to interfere with my rule. Thank you for giving them a solid whomping.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Felrock Mystic]]s, [[Felrock Rager]]s, and [[Felrock Beast Tamer]]s.

==Progression==
{{Shaman artifact and class hall}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
