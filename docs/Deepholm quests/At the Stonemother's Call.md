==Objectives==
Speak to [[Therazane]], the Stonemother.

==Description==
It is time. The Stonemother will speak with you. You can find her throne in northern [[Deepholm]], above the [[Scoured Reach]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|15}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Therazane (faction)|Therazane]]

==Completion==
So you've come.

[[Curse of Flesh|Fleshlings]] just like you killed [[Theradras|my daughter...]] my only daughter. [[Princess Theradras (quest)|With no provocation]].

Not sated at stripping me of my family, more of you flocked to [[Deathwing]] to serve him in ravaging my home.

You're quite arrogant to come before me asking for MY help. I'm tempted to crush you where you stand.

==Notes==
To the northwest corner of the zone! All of the [[Stone Lords]] are there as well.

;Her gossip text
:<The Stonemother stares down at you. Through you. As if she's peering at your soul.>
:My daughter, [[Theradras]], sequestered herself deep within the Crystal Caves of [[Terramok]] to grieve for her lost love, [[Zaetar]]. There, heartless, stoneless beings invaded and slaughtered her amidst her mourning.
:If I had any reason to trust a creature afflicted by the [[curse of flesh]], it was stripped from me that day. And yet in your arrogance, you persist.
:One day, you will outlive your usefulness.

:{{text|say|Therazane|You stand here trying to convince me that these beings of flesh should be trusted.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|They are the literal incarnation of corruption. Their very skin screams it.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|They seek only power, as the Twilight do. Yet you are confident that they will not turn on us. Did I raise you to be fools?}}
:{{text|say|Gorsik the Tumultuous|I have no love for the intruders, Stonemother, but these fleshlings went well out of their way to cleanse the filth from the Crimson Expanse.}}
:{{text|say|Gorsik the Tumultuous|They are not the Twilight. I see no reason to oppose their goals.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|They slaughtered stone troggs, Gorik [sic]? This is supposed to sway me? It is not much of a feat.}}
:{{text|say|Felsen the Enduring|I've not spoken with the strangers, but I bore witness to their champion treading deep into the Crumbling Depths and returning unscathed. It is clearly capable.}}
:{{text|say|Terrath the Steady|This champion also faced the Stone Dragons and their Broodmother with no glimpse of fear or hesitation. I've seen the most hardy of giants falter where the fleshling did not.}}
:{{text|say|Diamant the Patient|You know where I stand, Stonemother.}}
:{{text|say|Diamant the Patient|This champion has proved intent and capable.}}
:{{text|say|Diamant the Patient|I see no reason to deny our trust.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|What of you Boden? What do you see in this "champion"?}}
:{{text|say|Boden the Imposing|It's not bravery that drives it. It strode before me like it thought this place its home. It is a fool. It will surely get itself killed soon enough.}}
:{{text|say|Therazane|That very well may be. Even fools have uses though. I keep you around after all.}}
