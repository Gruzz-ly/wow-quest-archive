== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Diamant the Patient}} at the northeast edge of the [[Jagged Wastes]].

== Description ==
<{{NPC||Earthmender Norsala||Norsala}} reaches to the ground in an attempt to discern Diamant's location, but jumps back in shock after a moment's contact.>

My! Dat was unexpected. Diamant ain't far at all. When I reached out ta him, he spoke back wit me and told me where we could be finin' him. Head towards tha northeastern edge of the Jagged Wastes - Diamant will be expectin' ya.

<name>, be careful. It may be unlike an [[earth elemental|earth bein']] to lay an ambush, but it was unlike dem to siege the [[Temple of Earth|temple]] in da first place. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|2|15}}

== Completion ==
Ah... you are the <race> that I was expecting.

You have come on behalf of the [[Earthen Ring]], then?

== Notes ==
Fly to the north''east'', past {{NPC||Boden the Imposing}}, toward {{NPC||Lorthuna's Gate}}, a [[Twilight's Hammer]] camp. Diamant is on the ridge overlooking the camp. Diamant's gossip text:
:Among the Twilight cult are magics that threaten us greatly.
:We have every desire to wipe their existence from our home.
:We are divided, and so we cannot.
:And so I watch...
:And wait...

This begins the journey to gain [[reputation]] with [[Therazane (faction)|Therazane]]...starting at 0/36000 {{reputation|Hated}}. Ack.

At least now it's 500, or 550 with [[Mr. Popularity]].
