==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Avalanchion Elemental Lord.jpg|Avalanchion|Slay him to prevent the impending attack upon Stonehearth.}}
Slay Avalanchion.
*[[Avalanchion]] slain

==Description==
;Automatic
:Avalanchion stands before you. Slay him to keep [[Therazane]]'s forces from attacking [[Stonehearth]].

;Slate Quicksand
:You have to go back and slay Avalanchion to keep Therazane's forces from attacking Stonehearth! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|16|40}} (or {{cost|20|67}} at max level)

==Completion==
You've done what few others could have. Defeating Avalanchion was no small feat.

I'm impressed, <name>. Will you help us with our war against the stone troggs so that we can rescue the Stonefather?

==Notes==
Go take him out.

The hard part is getting out of the cave and back to Stonehearth. Thankfully the mobs are all too busy fighting each other to notice adventurers getting out of the cave. Avoid unnecessary fighting, get to the surface and fly back to Stonehearth.
