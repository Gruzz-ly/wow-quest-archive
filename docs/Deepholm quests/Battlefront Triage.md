==Objectives==
Patch up 10 Injured Earthen.
*[[Injured Earthen (Deepholm)|Injured Earthen]] patched up x10
*[[Deepvein's Patch Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
You seem quick on your feet, <race>. I need someone to go out into the chaos of the battlefront and patch up our injured.

Take my kit. It's simple enough to use.

Heal them before the [[stone trogg]]s finish them off for good.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

==Progress==
There are more injured Earthen on the battlefront.

==Completion==
If you ever get tired of being a <class>, come look me up. You seem very good with those flesh hands of yours.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Shatter Them!]] and [[Fixer Upper]] before heading out. Look for units called "Injured Earthen".
