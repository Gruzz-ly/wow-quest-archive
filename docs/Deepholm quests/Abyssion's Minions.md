== Objectives ==
Defeat 8 Twilight or Dragonkin units at [[Abyssion's Lair]].
*Abyssion's underlings defeated x8

== Description ==
If it's {{NPC||Abyssion||the dragon}} that's got the fragment, we're going to need to draw his attention back to his lair.

Go there and defeat his underlings. That should get him to show up with the [[World Pillar]] fragment sooner or later.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
Did you succeed, <name>?

== Completion ==
That ought to get the dragon's attention, <name>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Block the Gates]] before heading out. Fly east and start killing. Anything that moves counts.
