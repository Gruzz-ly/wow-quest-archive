==Objectives==
Kill High Priestess Lorthuna.
*[[High Priestess Lorthuna]] slain

==Description==
A noise in the main chamber of the [[Temple of Earth|temple]] draws your attention. You hear a familiar laugh... Lorthuna. She's returned to interrupt the ritual - you must stop her!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Dimension Spike|Blacksoul Polearm|Spire of Defiance|Riftrent Waraxe}}
You will also receive: {{cost|25|80}}

==Progress==
Stop Lorthuna! Don't let her interrupt the ritual!

==Completion==
[[Maruut Stonebinder|Maruut]] said when this all started that he would gladly give his life to see our task done. He would be proud of this success... of this death.

The rift is now closed on this side. [[Deepholm]] should stabilize. It will take time for {{NPC||Thrall}} to mend the wound in [[Azeroth]], and we'll likely need to remain until he finishes doing so.

Thank you for all you've done. I doubt we could have accomplished this so soon without you.

==Notes==
All hell has broken loose in the center room. Get close to Maruut so as to stay in range of Stormcaller Jalara. Jalara will chain heal as necessary. Focus on Lorthuna, who retains her abilities from earlier and gains Shadow Bolt and Shadow Bolt Volley. At 66% health, she will ascend! Keep focusing on her and eventually the cavalry will arrive in the form of Therazane's forces! Kill Lorthuna to end the siege, saving the World Pillar!

This concludes the [[Deepholm quests|Deepholm storyline]]. Therazane offers [[The Stone Throne]], which unlocks [[Therazane (faction)|her faction's]] daily quests.
