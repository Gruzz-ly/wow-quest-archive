==Objectives==
Use Therazane's Portal to travel to the [[Crumbling Depths]]. Accompany [[Stormcaller Mylra]] and [[Thrall]] to recover the [[Doomhammer]].
* Enter the Crumbling Depths
* Return to the [[Maelstrom]]

==Description==
<Thrall listens intently.>

You found it! The Doomhammer fell to the Crumbling Depths... But the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] remains a step ahead of us. If we hurry, we can follow the [[demon]] [[Geth'xun]] and retrieve the hammer before any more of [[Deepholm|this realm]] is corrupted.

[[Therazane]] will open a portal directly there. Let's go!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|58|20|}}
* 22,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What of the Doomhammer?

==Completion==
The [[orc]]s had a [[prophecy]] about the Doomhammer. It was said that a stranger will raise the hammer high, and with it, justice shall reign. Maybe... maybe YOU were meant to be that stranger all along.

Come, <name>. The [[Earthen Ring]] needs you. And [[Azeroth]] needs us.

Up ahead are [[Corrupted Shale Spider]]s.

:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|Look out! They're hidin' in the dust!}}
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|Keep your eyes on Thrall. He's wounded. He's likely to kill himself down here, and I don't wanna be the one who has to tell [[Aggralan|his wife]]!}}

:{{text|say|Geth'xun|I will corrupt your sorry world from within.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|The whole of Azeroth will rise against you, demon.}}

:''Shaman player heals Mylra.''
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|Thank ye...}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|The Doomhammer chose you, shaman. Already you wield it with a power that I never tapped into.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I must go my own way. I have a lot of thinking to do. [[Aggra]] will be at the Maelstrom shortly. Listen to her counsel... she has taught me so much.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Go back to the Earthen Ring. Bring them together. Turn their might against the Legion. This is your time.}}
:''Shaman player then mounts [[Stormbeak]].''
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|Come, let's go. With heroes like you, we just might have a prayer of saving the world. To the Maelstrom!}}
