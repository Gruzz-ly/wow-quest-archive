==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Maziel.jpg|Maziel|End his madness.}}
Slay Maziel inside the [[Silverlight Cave]] in [[Deepholm]].
*[[Maziel]] slain

==Description==
[[Maziel's Journal|Maziel's journal]] chronicles a ritual of ascendancy that would transfigure his body to one of pure quicksilver.

The ritual would talke place in the cave near the [[Lower Silvermarsh]], where Maziel would feed upon the {{NPC||Mercurial Ooze||mercurial oozes}} until achieving full strength.

Perhaps it is not too late to put an end to his madness.

==Completion==
You've disposed of an enemy before he could grow more powerful. By eliminating Maziel you've also ensured that his powers will not be used against the [[Earthen Ring]].
