== Objectives ==
Bring {{NPC||First Mate Moody}} a Bottle of Whiskey and a Spool of Rope.
*[[Bottle of Whiskey]]
*[[Spool of Rope]]

== Description ==
Not sure who you're with, but you don't look like one of... [[Twilight's Hammer|them]].

I'm not sure what happened. I slept through supper and woke up to a ship full of dead people and murderers.

Not sure if you want to kill me or not, but I'll spare you the trouble.

<Moody points to a wound in his stomach. His insides are not where they should be.>

I can keep steering the ship for a while longer. You don't die from a gut wound immediately.

Just bring me some rope and some rum... no, whiskey.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Gloves of Idle Hands|Press Gang Girdle|Midnight Service Treads}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|20}}

== Progress ==
You have what I asked for?

== Completion ==
All right, help me get tied to the wheel.

<Moody sips from the bottle.>

== Notes ==
Just off the starboard side of the main deck is a small lifeboat with the Bottle of Whiskey sitting on it. At the bow is the Spool of Rope. Looting it spawns a {{NPC||Twilight Saboteur}}:
:{{text|say|Twilight Saboteur|I thought we'd killed everybody... {{NPC||Mor'norokk the Hateful||Mor'norokk}} should be pleased with this!}}

Head back to the poopdeck upstairs after finishing up [[All Our Friends Are Dead]] to continue the chain.

''On complete:''
:{{text|say|First Mate Moody|Thanks... this'll give us a couple of more hours of not running into the rocks. No guarantees after that.}}
