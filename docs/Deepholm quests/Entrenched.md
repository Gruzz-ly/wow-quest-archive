== Objectives ==
Seek out {{NPC||Kor the Immovable}} among the [[Shuddering Spires]].

== Description ==
Your intentions appear true.

I will impress upon the other [[Stone Lords]] my wary trust.

With this, they should speak to you.

More importantly, they should listen.

Earning their favor may take time. Earning the {{NPC||Therazane||Stonemother's}} may take more time. This is a potent offering, so be generous with it.

Among the Shuddering Spires, you shall find Kor the Immovable. He is evenly tempered. His situation lends itself well to seeking outside aid.

Go to him.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|2|15}}

== Completion ==
{{NPC||Diamant the Patient||Diamant}} says you are to be trusted. Diamant is patient and wise, so I shall allow you to prove yourself.

As it happens. I could use hands that are more... mobile.

== Notes ==
Fly to the northwest, past the temple. Before reaching the trogg camp, find Kor the Immovable, entrenched. His gossip text:
:[[Deepholm]] was a slow, quiet place. Always alive. Steadily moving. Never rushed. In this time, I strived to become one with the earth, and to a large degree, I succeeded.
:Later, the {{NPC||Deathwing||Earthwarder}} returned, injured. He did not upset the balance at first. He'd stayed here before, and we knew of him. The shift did not truly begin until the [[Twilight's Hammer|Twilight cult]] joined him.
