== Objectives ==
Complete the One With the Ground ritual.
*One With the Ground ritual complete

== Description ==
The leader of the [[Therazane|Stone Mother]]'s forces here is the great earth elemental lord, [[Avalanchion]]. Luckily for us, the [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists have decided to invade his lair. They're seeking to bind his elementals to their will.

We will take advantage of the chaos. The earth ritual that I invoke will make you one with the ground. It will take you near to Avalanchion without alerting him to your presence.

It's up to you to finish him.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Completion ==
Now that the ritual is complete and you are near Avalanchion, there's only one thing left to do.

("Avalanchion is just ahead. You know what to do.")

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Slate Quicksand|Just let me know when you're ready for the ritual, <name>.}}
:We must keep Therazane's forces from attacking Stonehearth.
:If they do, they will steal the middle fragment of the [[World Pillar]].
{{gossip|''Arch Geomancer, I am ready for the ritual.''}}

The ritual will take players through the Shattered Field to the southeast to the back of [[Avalanchion's Vault]], where the quest automatically completes.
