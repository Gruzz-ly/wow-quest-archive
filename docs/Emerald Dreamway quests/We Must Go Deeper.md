==Objectives==
Speak to Merithra to travel deeper into the Emerald Dream.
* Speak to [[Merithra]] to travel deeper into the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]]

==Description==
[[Emerald Shard|These shards]] can only do so much in their current state. They are broken and scattered... not unlike my kin.

We must bring them together.

Let us go deeper into the Emerald Dream. I know of a place where we can reforge the shards into a [[dragonscale]]. With it, you can empower the [[:Heart of Azeroth]] with the essence of [[Green dragonflight|my dragonflight]]. We must go to the ancient heart of the Dream, where [[Ysera|my mother]] once rested.

Speak with me when you are ready to delve deeper.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}

==Completion==
The extent of the corruption is more dire than I thought. My mother used to love this place... and now it withers within the [[Void]]'s grasp.

==Notes==
Speak with Merithra:

{{Gossip|(Quest) I'm ready to go deeper into the Emerald Dream.}}

==Progression==
{{The Long Awake}}
