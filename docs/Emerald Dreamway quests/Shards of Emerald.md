==Objectives==
Collect Emerald Shards in the [[Emerald Dreamway|Dreamway]].
* [[Emerald Shard]] (7)

==Description==
[[Kalecgos]] tells me that you seek the power of the [[dragonflight]]s in its most essential form. There may be something here that can help you.

Fragments of our latent power have coalesced here in the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]].

They are scattered about the Dreamway, where my kin have fallen. Within the Dream, you should be able to wield those fragments in their raw state.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* +250 reputation with [[Champions of Azeroth]]
*[[Glowing Azerite]] (300x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Have you collected the shards?

==Completion==
This power once belonged to my flight, passed down through [[Ysera|my mother]] when she was empowered by the [[Titan]], [[Eonar]].

<[[Merithra]] lowers her head for a moment.>

If you are to use it to help save [[Azeroth|our world]], then we must first bind these fragments together.

==Notes==
