[[File:Karkarius - Overwhelming Emptiness.jpg|thumb|Karkarius, ensnared by the Void.]]

==Objectives==
Wake Thessera, Verdisa and Karkarius from [[Void]] dreams.
* [[Thessera]] woken
* [[Verdisa]] woken
* [[Karkarius]] woken

==Description==
The Void assaults us as we sleep! Those who it ensnares may never wake again.

They can only be roused by powerful [[magic]] native to [[Green dragonflight|our dragonflight]]. The shards that have formed near our fallen kin may be exactly what is needed.

If we succumb to slumber in the Void, we will be lost forever. Please, aid us!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* +250 reputation with [[Champions of Azeroth]]
*[[Glowing Azerite]] (300x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Please, hurry and save my kin before they are lost forever to the Void.

==Completion==
Karkarius... and Thessera, too? I never thought...

It saddens me terribly that some would choose to die instead of fight. This life may be fraught with hardship, but it is the only one we have.

I am grateful that you tried to save them, even if they were not willing to be saved.

==Notes==
You need to have an [[Emerald Shard]] that grants Emerald Empowerement to wake the dragons who have the Overwhelming Emptiness buff.
