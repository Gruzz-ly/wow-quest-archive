==Objectives==
Speak with Merithra to enter the Emerald Dreamway.
* Speak with [[Merithra]] to Enter the [[Emerald Dreamway|Dreamway]]

==Description==
We have little time, so I will be brief.

The [[Emerald Dream]] is under attack. The shadows of the [[Void]] are on the rise, and not even the Dream is beyond their reach. Many of my kin have already been slain, and still more are at risk.

We must enter the Dreamway and save what remains of [[Green dragonflight|my dragonflight]] before it is too late.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}

==Completion==
Now you see how dire our situation is. The Void is consuming us!

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Merithra of the Dream|We must enter the Dreamway before the rest of my flight is lost. Speak to me when you are ready.}}

Speak with Merithra:
:I fear that even if [[Azeroth]] is saved, my brothers and sisters of the green dragonflight are doomed.

:Still, we will do everything in our power to help save our world.

:{{Gossip|quest=|I'm ready.}}
:{{Gossip|quest=|I need to return to the Emerald Dreamway.}} (''replaces the above option if you've previously entered the Dreamway.)
:{{Gossip|Who are you?}}

::I am Merithra, daughter of [[Ysera]], the Dreamer.

::I had thought that she would be here forever. Until she wasn't.

::For eons my flight has watched over the Dream and the realms of nature. I cannot hide from this duty. Even if I fail, I must try.

::There is too much at stake to do nothing.

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}

Once you are teleported to the Dreamway, Merithra has new options.

:{{Gossip|Send me back to [[Val'sharah]].}}
:{{Gossip|Where is Ysera?}}

::Ysera, the Dreamer, lost her life in Val'sharah after she was corrupted by the [[Emerald Nightmare|Nightmare]].

::In the end, it seemed as if [[Elune]] welcomed her [[Ghost|spirit]] with open arms. I pray she is at peace.

::{{Gossip|Let's talk about something else.}}
