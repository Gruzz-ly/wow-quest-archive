==Objectives==
Slay Void invaders in the [[Emerald Dreamway]].
* [[Void]] invaders slain  (20)

==Description==
The [[green dragonflight]] cannot stop this tide of Void creatures on our own. Not with our reduced strength.

Please, lend us your might and drive them from the Dreamway before they can enter the waking realm.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* +250 reputation with [[Champions of Azeroth]]
*[[Glowing Azerite]] (300x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
If we cannot drive the Void out of the Dreamway, it could spread across all of [[Azeroth]].

==Completion==
Thank you. With fewer of those Void creatures about, we can attempt to secure the Dreamway.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Voidswarm]]s, [[Void Haunt]]s, and [[Shadehound (skeletal hound)|Shadehounds]].
**[[Terror Beast]]s are also listed as counting towards the objective but are unreleased.

==Progression==
{{The Long Awake}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.2.0|note=Added.}}
