{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Gnomeregan Mindslicer|Gilnean Slicer|Draenic Shacklebreaker}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Completion ==
A job well done. Now you don't need to worry about what would have happened to them if you hadn't been around.

The last one was even appreciative enough to give you a reward they'd kept on their person.

== Notes ==
While on the quests [[Runestones of Binding]] and [[Ascend No More!]] inside of [[L'ghorek]], a Twilight's Hammer cultist will drop the Twilight Cage Key, which starts this quest. Free prisoners in cages in the Twilight camp in the southwestern portion of L'ghorek's main chamber.
