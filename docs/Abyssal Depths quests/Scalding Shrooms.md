==Objectives==
Collect 5 Scalding Shrooms.
*[[Scalding Shroom]] x5

==Description==
We think that we have a use for the [[Merciless One|merciless one]]s that your friend from the cave delivered to us. But I need a preservative for it.

Down below in the [[Scalding Chasm]] are some mushrooms with the properties that I need. Bring some back up to me and I'll see what I can do.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

==Progress==
I heard that you had an unpleasant encounter with putting one of the demons on your head. I can assure you that they are all now quite dead.

==Completion==
I will use the mushrooms as a reagent to treat the corpses. We will have one ready for you soon.

==Notes and trivia==
*Pick up [[Clearing the Defiled]] and [[Into the Totem]] before heading out. Yay mindless fetch-questing!
*During development this quest was named '''Fireplume Shrooms'''.
