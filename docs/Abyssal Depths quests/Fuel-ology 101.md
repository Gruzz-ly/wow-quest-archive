== Objectives ==
Use the Fuel Sampling Station in [[Darkbreak Cove]] to create the perfect biofuel.
*Create the perfect bio-fuel

== Description ==
How much do you know about fuel, <name>? Constructing the perfect fuel is a tricky job, as there's plenty of factors to balance: chrono-pyroxidation parameters, tempero-incendiary variables, conflagrational stiltification criteria... and that's only naming a few.

Hopefully the samples you brought me can be combined in the right proportions to create... the perfect biofuel. Use that table over there and try combining some samples! Bring the result to me when you're done.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Gloves of Delicate Mixture|Vapor-Proof Headcover|Chemical-Stained Shoulderplates}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
We haven't found the right combination yet, <name>. Keep at it! I'm sure you can figure it out!

== Completion ==
Have you considered a career in science, <name>? If you ever get tired of this <class> nonsense, come see me! I could use an assistant with your devotion to experimentation and the scientific method.

== Notes ==
The sampling station will let players pick out any combination of five total Terrapin, Remora and Hammerhead samples, then mix them together. The correct mix is two Remora and three Hammerhead samples.
