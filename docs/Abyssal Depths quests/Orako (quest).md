==Objectives==
Report to [[Orako]] at [[Coldlight Chasm]] in [[Vashj'ir]].

==Description==
<[[Captain "Jewels" Verne|Captain Verne]] looks down at his watch.>

Where is that [[hunter]]? I sent Orako to Coldlight Chasm to prepare a recon report a week ago! Sure, he's a handful, and I didn't mind getting him out of my hair, but I need his report.

Say, what's your name? <Name>? Would you be wililng to go track him down? It seems strange to send a <class> to find a hunter, but I'm running out of options.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||78}}

==Completion==
Gah! These fish are impossible to hit!

<Orako looks at you.>

My wolf got eaten by a fish, and I'm not going back until I find her.

==Notes==
Exit the cave and turn west-northwest. Head west toward [[L'ghorek]]'s head. Orako is at the same height as L'ghorek, and not down in the chasm itself on the western ridge. He appears to be busy taking pot-shots with a double-barreled shotgun that has quite a kick at the fish swarming him...
*AHA! A FISH!
*Oh, Captain Jewels is going to be angry...
*Here, fishie fishie...
*You hold still, fish!
*Why must you taunt me so?
*Get... back... over... here...
