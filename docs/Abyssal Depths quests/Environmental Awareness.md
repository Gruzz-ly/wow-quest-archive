==Objectives==
Use the Oil Extrusion Pump on the corpses of [[Seabrush Terrapin]]s, [[Scourgut Remora]]s, and [[Spinescale Hammerhead]]s in [[Seabrush]] to obtain 5 Terrapin Oil, 5 Remora Oil, and 5 Hammerhead Oil.
*[[Terrapin Oil]] (5)
*[[Remora Oil]] (5)
*[[Hammerhead Oil]] (5)
*[[Oil Extrusion Pump]] (provided)

==Description==
Have you ever smelled submarine fuel, <name>? It's nasty stuff. Unfortunately, we need to burn huge amounts of it to get the ''[[Verne]]'' to move, and it's both bad-smelling AND deadly to the local wildlife. We need to be more environmentally conscious.

The sea creatures nearby have particularly oily flesh. Take this device up to Seabrush - just above [[Tenebrous Cavern|this cave]] - and use it on the corpses of [[Seabrush Terrapin|terrapin]]s, [[remora]]s, and [[hammerhead shark]]s. Their oil might save the lives of hundreds of other sea creatures.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|80}}
*27700 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
Please... don't tell the other [[goblin]]s that I'm an environmentalist! I don't think I can take the mocking!

==Completion==
<Fiasco sticks a finger into each sample and sniffs it.>

Yes, I think this will do.

==Notes==
Exit the cave, then turn around to the northwest. On the "seafloor" of the ridge are terrapin and hammerheads, while hanging out underneath overhangs are remora. Also keep an eye out for [[Alliance Sea-Scout]]s. Killing one starts [[Secure Seabrush]] automatically.
