== Description ==
A fish ate my wolf, and [[deep sea murloc|murloc]]s look like fish. I'm going to make those murlocs pay!

Head back down to the chasm and kill the fishmen! My wolf will be avenged!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

I know, murlocs aren't fish. I thought that killing them would make me feel better, but I still feel sad about my wolf.

<Orako sighs.>

Pick up [[Here Fishie Fishie]] before heading out. While killing deep sea murlocs, one of them will drop the [[Enormous Eel Egg (Horde)]], which starts the quest [[I Brought You This Egg]].
