== Objectives ==
Deliver the Brain of the Unfathomable to {{NPC||L'ghorek}} in the [[Cerebrillum]] inside of L'ghorek in [[Vashj'ir]].
*[[The Brain of the Unfathomable]] (provided)

== Description ==
Place the dead {{NPC||Merciless One||merciless demon}} upon your head to pose as one of their slaves.

Enter L'ghorek. Commune with the ancient.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
I SENSE... SOMETHING. COME CLOSER...

== Completion ==
WISE OF... YOUR {{NPC||Erunak Stonespeaker||ERUNAK}} TO... HAVE... YOU USE... THE FACELESS' BRAIN. I SEE... YOU NOW.

I WILL DIE. THERE IS NO... STOPPING... THE INEVITABLE.

BUT... YOU WILL HELP... ME DEAL WITH... THESE PARASITES FIRST.

== Notes ==
Much like Nespirah, swim into one of the orifices near L'ghorek's head, then turn toward the center and enter the brain room. Here, players act with L'ghorek's brain itself, rather than through the crab intermediary in Nespirah! Its gossip text:
:<L'ghorek's voice booms inside your mind.>
:I AM ALMOST... DEAD. YOU MUST HELP... STOP... THE [[Twilight's Hammer|TWILIGHT'S HAMMER]].
:THEY DRAIN... MY ENERGY TO... CREATE... THEIR ASCENDANTS. THEY ARE A... GRAVE THREAT IN... THE IMMINENT WAR... VERSUS... {{NPC||Neptulon||NEPTULON}}.

  |bluenote=Players will now be in the correct phase with Wavespeaker Valoren after completing the quest "Communing with the Ancient". Seeing ghost question marks on the mini-map is no fun for anyone.
