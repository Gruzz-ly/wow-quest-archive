==Objectives==
Slay 8 Corrupting Faceless while they are within range of the Confinement Totem.
*[[Corrupting Faceless]] energies confined x8
*[[Erunak's Confinement Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
Down into the [[Fireplume Trench]] you must take my totem. Use it to capture the energies of the [[faceless one|faceless]] as they die. The totem will keep them from returning whence they came.

When the totem is full, bring it back to me and we will use it to lure their leader up from deep down below.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

==Progress==
Is the totem full?

==Completion==
Yes, <race>, can you feel them seething with a desire to break free and destroy us?

This is good! They will be the perfect lure for their leader.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Clearing the Defiled]] and [[Scalding Shrooms]] before heading out. Yay slightly-less mindless killing!
