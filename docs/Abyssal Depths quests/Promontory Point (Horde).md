==Objectives==
Speak with [[Legionnaire Nazgrim]] on [[Promontory Point]] in [[Vashj'ir]].

==Description==
<Name>, I need you to get this information to Legionnaire Nazgrim on Promontory Point. He's up there to the northwest with [[Erunak Stonespeaker]] and those [[Earthen Ring]] people.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3490 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|8300}} at max level)

==Completion==
If it weren't you saying it, I wouldn't believe what that [[Fiasco Sizzlegrin|troublesome goblin]] has to say. This is troubling indeed, but I think our Earthen Ring friends have a few ideas.

And now that you're here....
