==Objectives==
Use the [[Fuel Sampling Station]] in [[Tenebrous Cavern]] to create the perfect bio-fuel.
*Create the perfect bio-fuel

==Description==
How much do you know about fuel, <name>? Constructing the perfect fuel is a tricky job, as there's plenty of factors to balance: chrono-pyroxidation parameters, tempero-incendiary variables, conflagrational siltification criteria... and that's only naming a few.

Hopefully the samples you brought me can be combined in the right proportions to create... the perfect bio-fuel. Use that table over there to try combining these samples! Bring the result to me when you're done.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Gloves of Delicate Mixture|Vapor-Proof Headcover|Chemical-Stained Shoulderplates}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|7|80}}
*27700 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Progress==
We haven't found the right combination yet, <name>. Keep at it! I'm sure you can figure it out.

==Completion==
That's it. Starting today, I'm shifting the ''[[Verne]]'' over to bio-fuel. I'll send some men up to harvest more oil.

Think of all the creatures that we've saved today, <name>!

==Notes==
{{Stub-section|Proper walkthrough and transcript.}}
Head northeast in the cave to the Fuel Sampling Station. Players can mix together five samples of the three types of oil in any concentration they wish. Good luck!
