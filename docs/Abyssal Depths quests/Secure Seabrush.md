== Objectives ==
Kill 7 Alliance Sea-Scouts in [[Seabrush]].
*[[Alliance Sea-Scout]] slain x7

== Description ==
The [[Alliance]] has spies in this area? [[Tenebrous Cavern]] is nearby, and inside lies the [[Horde]]'s new submarine, the ''[[Verne]]''! The Alliance must not be allowed anywhere nearby!

Someone in the cavern will want to hear of this incursion... after you finish slaying some more of these scheming Alliance spies.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
You saw Alliance spies up above? Destroy them!

== Completion ==
You did well, <name>. We need to be especially wary of Alliance attacks right now. The Verne's got plenty of firepower out at sea, but in the back of this cave, she's far too vulnerable.

== Notes ==
While out and about in Seabrush for [[Environmental Awareness]] and [[When in Vashj'ir...]], players are likely to come across Alliance Sea-Scouts. Kill one to automatically be offered this quest. Then kill six more. They are easiest to find on the seafloor to the left as you exit [[Tenebrous Cavern]].
