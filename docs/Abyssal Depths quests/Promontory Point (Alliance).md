==Objectives==
Speak with [[Taylor|Captain Taylor]] on [[Promontory Point]] in [[Vashj'ir]].

==Description==
We need to get this information up to Captain Taylor on Promontory Point! He's out there to the northwest with [[Erunak Stonespeaker]] and the [[Earthen Ring]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3490 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|8300}} at max level)

==Completion==
That's very disturbing news, but I believe our Earthen Ring friends here have a plan.

And now that you're here....
