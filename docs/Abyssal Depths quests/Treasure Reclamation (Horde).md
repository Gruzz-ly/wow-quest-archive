== Objectives ==
Collect 12 Deepfin Plunder.
*[[Deepfin Plunder]] x12

== Description ==
Blood and thunder! We have our reinforcements, but they still need to be paid. They won't be cheap.

Up on Deepfin Ridge to the northwest, the slimy gilblin have stolen all sorts of treasure. It's time to reclaim some of it for the Horde.

Hellscream's eyes are upon you, <name>!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
How much plunder did you get, <name>?

== Completion ==
That's a lot! And we know where there's more should the need arise.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Sira'kess Slaying (Horde)|Sira'kess Slaying]], [[A Standard Day for Azrajar (Horde)|A Standard Day for Azrajar]] and [[Those Aren't Masks (Horde)|Those Aren't Masks]] before heading out. Target location is way, way to the northwest, north of [[Promontory Point]] and to the west of the [[Abyssal Breach]]. On gilgoblin columns, last seen in the [[Kelp'thar Forest]], look for chests with plunder in them. Or just kill {{NPC||Deepfin Scrounger}}s.
