== Objectives ==
Slay 15 Sira'kess Naga.
*Sira'kess naga slain x15

== Description ==
You're the infamous <name>? Good to meet ya, love. Let's have a butcher's hook.

Well, enough rabbit, right? Let's get down to it. I need you to swim out northwest to the [[Sira'kess Front]] and read and write them snakes something quick.

Nothing fancy. They're looking for a bother, and we'll give 'em a right good one in the ol' boat race.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
This one's not bright and breezy, love, but when they're brown bread, we'll have ourselves a good tumble down the sink, you and I.

Right?

== Completion ==
Chicken and rice, <name>! That will show those sorry and sad snakes who's the ol' pitch and toss!

Now it's bird lime for that tiddlywink. Finger and thumb or plink plonk?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Standard Day for Azrajar (Alliance)|A Standard Day for Azrajar]], [[Those Aren't Masks (Alliance)|Those Aren't Masks]] and [[Treasure Reclamation (Alliance)|Treasure Reclamation]] before heading out. Target location is way, way to the northwest, north of [[Promontory Point]] and to the west of the [[Abyssal Breach]]. Naga are everywhere on the ridge, both at the Sira'kess Front on the east end, or the gilgoblin territory on the west.
