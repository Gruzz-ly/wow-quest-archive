==Objectives==
Slay any 8 [[Crushing Eel]]s, [[Deep Remora]]s or [[Chasm Stalker]]s.
*Corrupted Fireplume Trench wildlife slain (8)

==Description==
Our [[Earthen Ring]] friends here are wondering if we can lend them a hand. It seems that there are some [[faceless one|faceless]] demons down below in the [[Fireplume Trench]] that are corrupting all of the wildlife.

Can you take care of that for me?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Eel-Slayer Legguards|Remora-Crusher Staff|Trench-Stalker Shotgun}}
You will also receive: {{cost|8|20}}

==Progress==
I'm going to need you to kill a few more of those things. The [[shaman]] here are very particular about it. You'd think they were [[druid]]s.

==Completion==
Good enough for me. Here's your share, as promised.

Don't get too complacent, <name>. The hard part's about to come.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Scalding Shrooms]] and [[Into the Totem]] before heading out. Yay mindless killing!
