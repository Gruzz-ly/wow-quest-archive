== Objectives ==
Slay 12 Nether Fiends.
*[[Nether Fiend]] slain x12

== Description ==
The [[ogre mage|ogre magi]] within the [[Undershell]] have summoned protectors for themselves: [[fleshbeast|fleshling]] fiends from the netherworld.

We cannot risk these aberrations from being later used against our forces. While you are in there, I want you to destroy as many of those things as you can.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
There are still more fiends to be destroyed.

== Completion ==
The last thing we needed was a bunch of summoned creatures swarming our forces during the final assault.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Unplug L'ghorek]] before heading out. Swim underneath L'ghorek to reach the Undershell. Then it's crazy-go-nuts time on the fleshbeasts.

==Progression==
