== Objectives ==
Slay Ur'Goz, Sku'Bu, and Neph'Lahim.
*[[Ur'Goz]] slain
*[[Sku'Bu]] slain
*[[Neph'Lahim]] slain

== Description ==
{{NPC||L'ghorek}} is the ancient that rests upon the shelf across from us. It is being controlled and its life energies slowly being consumed by something immense beneath us.

There is a cave known as the [[Undershell]] down below L'ghorek. In that cave are three powerful [[ogre mage|ogre magi]] that are maintaining a ritual connecting the thing below with the ancient. You must kill these three to disconnect L'ghorek.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
You must slay each of those ogre magi to stop their rituals and disconnect L'ghorek from the one below.

== Completion ==
Now that you have unplugged L'ghorek, we must attempt to make contact with it. I can sense that the ancient yet lives, but only barely.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Fiends from the Netherworld]] before heading out. Swim underneath L'ghorek to reach the Undershell. Look for three giant tentacles being channeled by ogre magi. Kill them and the tentacles will disconnect.
