*[[Enormous Eel Egg]] (provided)

==Description==
<This appears to be an egg from one of the [[Devious Great-Eel|devious great-eels]] that float up above the chasm. You wonder whether or not Humphrey might be interested in something like this.>

==Progress==
What've ya got there, <name>?

==Completion==
