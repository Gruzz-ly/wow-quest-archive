==Objectives==
Put on the Phosphora Fedora, then swim through the coral in [[Underlight Canyon]] to attract 30 Underlight Nibblers.
*[[Underlight Nibbler]] x30
*[[Phosphora Fedora]] (provided)

==Description==
Stick this device on your head, then swim through the kelp and coral along the canyon's edge. There should be all kinds of little fish in there that find your new antenna irresistible.

When we return to [[Darkbreak Cove]], we'll have armfuls of fish for everyone!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
How many did ya catch?

==Completion==
Ya did good, <name>! Ya did real good!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Coldlights Out]] before heading out. Put on the Fedora, then go swimming along the edge of the chasm. While killing deep sea murlocs, one of them will drop the [[Enormous Eel Egg (Alliance)]], which starts the quest [[Enormous Eel Egg]].
