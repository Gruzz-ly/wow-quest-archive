==Objectives==
Slay all of the [[Tentacle Horror]]s to free Wil'hai.
*Free [[Wil'hai]]
*[[Valoren's Shrinkage Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
Those tentacle horrors rising from the depths have trapped that poor beast. Please, <name>, can you save it by destroying those thigns?

Will you free Wil'hai?

Here, take my totem and plant it near the tentacles. The cold it emanates will cause major shrinkage on those monsters and then you'll be able to destroy them.

("Free Wil'hai")

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Hood of Teeming Horror|Tentacle-Slayer Bracers}}
You will also receive: {{cost|16|40}}

==Progress==
Wil'hai is still trapped.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

Those nightmarish creatures that rise from below give me pause. I fear that our efforts will be for nothing.

==Notes==
While in the [[Nightmare Depths]] on [[More Blood for the Depths]], players come across the wavespeaker at the border of the depths and the [[Fireplume Trench]] overlooking Wil'hai snared by three Tentacle Horrors.

Get within 50 yards of a Tentacle Horror and drop the totem. Before the shrinkage, Tentacle Horrors are boss-level tentacles with 309k health and melee for around 5,000 on cloth. Shrunk, they are merely level 82 tentacles with 46,246 health meleeing for around 500 on cloth.

Kill all three and Wil'hai will swim away to freedom. Hooray!
