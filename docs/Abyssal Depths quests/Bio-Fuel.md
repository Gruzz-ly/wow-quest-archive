==Objectives==
Use the Oil Extrusion Pump on the corpses of [[Seabrush Terrapin]]s, [[Scourgut Remora]]s and [[Spinescale Hammerhead]]s in [[Korthun's End]] to obtain 4 Terrapin Oil, 4 Remora Oil, and 4 Hammerhead Oil.
*[[Terrapin Oil]] (4)
*[[Remora Oil]] (4)
*[[Hammerhead Oil]] (4)
*[[Oil Extrusion Pump]] (provided)

==Description==
Submarine fuel is expensive!

The powers-that-be in [[Gnomeregan]] were generous enough to deliver several fuel barrels, but we're burning through it faster than expected. That means we're going to need to improvise.

It's a well-known fact that sea creatures are full of all kinds of interesting chemicals... like oil. Take this device up to Kothrun's End and stick it in the corpses of [[sea turtle|terrapin]]s, [[remora]]s, and [[hammerhead shark]]s. If we don't get more submarine fuel, their oil might be our only hope.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
How did the device work, <name>?

==Completion==
<Engineer Hexascrub sticks a finger into each sample and sniffs it.>

Yes, I think this will do.

==Notes==
Swim out of the cave, then straight up, then turn around back to the southwest to reach Korthrun's End. While in the area, keep an eye out for [[Hellscream Seadog]]s. Kill one to automatically start the quest [[Claim Korthun's End]]. Sharks and terrapin are both on the seafloor, while terrapin are hiding underneath ledges (so look up at the overhangs!)
