==Objectives==
Speak with [[Hydrius]] at the [[Abyssal Breach]] in the [[Abyssal Depths]] of [[Vashj'ir]].

==Description==
Go'el must be in the plane of water... the [[Abyssal Maw]] itself! I shudder to imagine what fate awaits him there.

Find the elemental, Hydrius, near the Abyssal Breach. He knows of Go'el and is sympathetic to our fight against [[Ragnaros]]. If anyone can help you there, it's him.

I will meet you beneath the tides of Vashj'ir, <race>...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*34700 XP (or {{coppercost|82700}} at max level)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Earthen Ring]]

==Completion==
I will do what I can to aid you, <class>.

==Notes==
Speak to Aggra again:
:I can only teleport us once. Make sure you are ready. Go'el waits for us at the bottom of the ocean...
:{{gossip|''Aggra, I'm ready to travel to the Abyssal Maw.''}}

Aggra will teleport herself and players to the southern lip of the Abyssal Breach in the Abyssal Depths. Players, whether or not they completed enough of Vashj'ir to gain [[Sea Legs]], have it for the duration of their time in the depths during these quests.

A short dialogue immediately begins:
<poem>
{{Text|Say|Aggra|The water here is disturbed... what is happening here?}}
{{Text|Say|Hydrius|Greetings, travelers. The tides of destiny have brought you far from the bright world above. I know what it is you seek - and it lies there before you...}}
{{Text|Say|Hydrius|Your world-shaman has become a vortex of longing and desire. See how his heart devours everything within its proximity? Tread lightly, traveler. lest you too, be consumed.}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|We arrived just in time! Go'el's spirit has become so unstable, it could collapse upon itself if we don't act fast.}}
</poem>

On complete: 
<poem>
{{Text|Say|Hydrius|Your world-shaman is already lost to the dark fathoms. He exists now only to consume - tortured by the currents of life he longed for - but never knew.}}
''Hydrius swims off.''
