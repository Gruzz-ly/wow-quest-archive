<poem>
''A vision of Thrall and [[Varian Wrynn]] standing face to face appears over the breach.''
{{Text|Say|Aggra|Look there - a vision within the torrent! Is this what Go'el longed for most? Peace with his enemies - an end to the constant warring of his world?}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|He... wished to lay down his weapon... and the burdens of leadership...}}
</poem>

<poem>
''A vision of Thrall and Aggra standing face to face appears over the breach.''
{{Text|Say|Aggra|Another Vision! I see Go'el, but...it...it's me. Was I his deepest desire? A mate with which to share his life... his burdens and his joys?}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|Hear me, Go'el! You ARE NOT alone! I'm here with you - I will NOT let you go!}}
''The two turn and walk together away as the vision fades.''
</poem>

At 65%:
<poem>
''A vision of Thrall, Aggra, and two orc children appears over the breach.''
{{Text|Say|Aggra|A final vision! Ancestors... could those be... our children? This was his deepest desire... to be a father?}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|... to have a family of his own... with me? Go'el never knew his parents... It was only a few years ago that he even found his people... I should have known this was what he wanted most.}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|Oh, Go'el, hold on!, I WILL free you! And you'll HAVE this life, I swear it!}}
</poem>

Upon reaching 100%, Thrall's desire will pull her into the vortex. Catch up to her and interact with her to free her.
<poem>
{{Text|Say|Aggra|Ancestors, give me strength! The vortex's pull is increasing! It's pulling me in! The power of his longing... it's overwhelming!}}
{{text|bossemote|Find and release Aggra before she gets pulled into the whirpool!}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|Fight this, Go'el! You've got to snap out of it!}}
</poem>

Once freed, Aggra swims back to her location on the lip of the breach as Hydrius swims back.
<poem>
{{Text|Say|Hydrius|You've done the impossible, shaman. You have stilled the vortex within him without losing yourself, in turn. Your love for him... must be very great.}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|I need... the world... needs him whole once again. Bue he's always placed the needs of others before his own. How long has he surpressed these feelings - these desires?}}
{{Text|Say|Aggra|He must embrace them and find balance... or this curse will never end.}}
{{Text|Yell|Hydrius|His aspect shifts once again! You are losing him!}}
{{Text|Yell|Aggra|Go'el!}}
</poem>

As the conversation ends, speak to Aggra to complete the quest.
