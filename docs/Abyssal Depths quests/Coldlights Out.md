== Objectives ==
Kill 4 Coldlight Hunters and 4 Coldlight Oracles.
*[[Coldlight Hunter]] slain x4
*[[Coldlight Oracle]] slain x4

== Description ==
Oh yeah! I was supposed to put together a report! I'd almost forgotten!

Looks like mostly harmless wildlife around here... 'cept for those {{NPC||Devious Great-Eel||blasted eels}}... and a few [[deep sea murloc|murlocs]]. {{NPC||Captain Glovaal||Cap'n}} will be more interested in the murlocs, I think.

Go engage a few of 'em in combat and see what kinda moves they got. From what I've seen, the big ones hunt for fish in the kelp, and the little ones practice some kind o' magic or another... but that's all I know.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Ya gotta get back out there, <name>. Cap'n needs this recon, and he's counting on me!

== Completion ==
<Humphrey listens as you recount your fights with the Coldlight murlocs.>

Hmm... they sound like regular ol' murlocs... just underwater. That'll make Cap'n Glovaal happy.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Lure]] before heading out. Put on the Fedora, then go swimming along the edge of the chasm. While killing deep sea murlocs, one of them will drop the [[Enormous Eel Egg (Alliance)]], which starts the quest [[Enormous Eel Egg (quest)]]. Turn on friendly nameplates (shift+v by default) to make the task far easier.

==Progression==
{{Abyssal Depths quest chain}}
