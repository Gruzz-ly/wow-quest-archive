== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Deepfin Plunder.
*[[Deepfin Plunder]] x6

== Description ==
We've got our reinforcements, but we still need to find a way to pay them. That kind of action doesn't come cheap.

Up on [[Deepfin Ridge]] to the northwest, the slimy [[gilgoblin|gilblin]] have stolen all sorts of treasure. I think that it's time to reclaim some of it for the cause.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
How much plunder have you managed to reclaim, <name>?

== Completion ==
That should be enough for now. We know where there's more should the need arise.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Sira'kess Slaying (Alliance)|Sira'kess Slaying]], [[A Standard Day for Azrajar (Alliance)|A Standard Day for Azrajar]] and [[Those Aren't Masks (Alliance)|Those Aren't Masks]] before heading out. Target location is way, way to the northwest, north of [[Promontory Point]] and to the west of the [[Abyssal Breach]]. On gilgoblin columns, last seen in the [[Kelp'thar Forest]], look for chests with plunder in them. Or just kill {{NPC||Deepfin Scrounger}}s.

==Progression==
{{Abyssal Depths quest chain}}
