== Objectives ==
Kill any 15 [[naga]] in the [[Abyssal Breach]].
* Kill 15 naga in the Abyssal Breach  (15)

== Description ==
The whispers of the elements are crowding my thoughts, <name>...

The [[Throne of the Tides]] is under siege!

I cannot stand idly by while the naga threaten [[Neptulon]]'s realm. We must find a way to join forces with him.

[[Nazgrim]] will escort me to the depths where I can commune directly with Neptulon.

I must ask you to take a more violent path. Keep the enemy forces distracted until I arrive safely at entrance to the Throne of Tides.

May the spirits see us through, <name>. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Submariner's Weighted Treads|Signet of the Lookout|Drape of the Helmsman}}
You will also receive: {{cost|24|60}} and [[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]

== Completion ==
They may think they've won, but my axe and I have something to say about that!

== Notes ==
There is no direct followup. At this point, players should follow Nazgrim and discover the entrance to the [[Throne of the Tides]]. Down in the maw, {{NPC||Wavespeaker Valoren}} stands just to the west of the instance entrance and offers to teleport players back to the [[Abyssal Depths]]. Inside the dungeon, Nazgrim offers [[Rescue the Earthspeaker! (Horde)|Rescue the Earthspeaker!]] and [[Sins of the Sea Witch (Horde)|Sins of the Sea Witch]].

There is no quick teleport back to the capital city, but remember the flight paths on the surface of the [[Shimmering Expanse]] do connect to the mainland. Additionally, [[The War Has Many Fronts (Horde)|The War Has Many Fronts]], offered on the ships, but requires level 82, also directs players that way.

Talk to Erunak again to start the event.
:Make your preparations, <name>, but do it quickly!
{{gossip|''I am prepared, Erunak. Let's go!''}}
:''The camera cuts outside as the sub exits the cave heading toward the Abyssal Breach. Inside the sub, players are in the bridge along with the crew and Erunak.''


:{{text|yell|{{NPC||Verne Crewmember}}|I got a clear shot here. Get me more ammo!}}
:{{text|yell|{{NPC||Nazgrim}}|You heard him! Keep that gun stocked with ammo!}}
:{{text|say|{{NPC||Hellscream's Vanguard (NPC)||Hellscream's Vanguard}}|Aye Sir!}}


:{{text|yell|Verne Crewmember|Now this is what I call a target rich environment!}}
:{{text|say|{{npc||Erunak Stonespeaker}}|Use caution when firing those shells...}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|Neptulon's revenants must not consider us enemies!}}


:{{text|yell|Nazgrim|Keep those naga away from the crater!}}
:{{text|yell|Nazgrim|If they get a foothold in the plane of water, we'll never get them out!}}


:{{text|say|[[Fiasco Sizzlegrin]]|Calculating trajectory...}}
:{{text|say|Fiasco Sizzlegrin|Calibrating fuse...}}
:{{text|say|Fiasco Sizzlegrin|Munitions ready!}}
:{{text|yell|Verne Crewmember|Commence Fire!}}
:{{text|say|Fiasco Sizzlegrin|Wahoo!}}


:{{text|say|Nazgrim|Where's the mighty Neptulon, shaman?!}}
:{{text|say|Nazgrim|Why are we stuck protecting his domain?}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|The lords of the elemental planes are beings of pure chaos, Nazgrim.}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|No one can discern their motives...}}
:{{text|say|Nazgrim|Bah! Unless he wants his home overrun by these serpents, he'd better show himself...}}


:{{text|say|Verne Crewmember|Look at the size of those things. What ARE they?}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|The naga have enlisted the aid of the Old God's minions.}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|Twisted creatures bent on the destruction of all living beings.}}
:{{text|say|Verne Crewmember|<Gulp>Sorry I asked...}}


:{{text|say|Nazgrim|The elementals are grossly outnumbered.}}
:{{text|say|Nazgrim|They don't stand a chance.}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|I sense desperation in them.}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|Without aid, they will fail.}}


:''The sub is circling the breach, taking pot shots, but there's not much the ship can do at distance against such numbers.''
:{{text|yell|Nazgrim|Enough of this!}}
:{{text|say|Nazgrim|We waste our time here just floating about...}}
:{{text|say|Nazgrim|If we are to defend the rift, we must do it directly!}}
:{{text|say|Nazgrim|Set us down next to the crater!}}
:{{text|say|Verne Crewmember|Th-there's no way, sir! The current... it's too strong!}}


:''The camera cuts outside as Lady Naz'jar tails the ship, ordering her naga to destroy it!''
:{{text|say|{{NPC||Lady Naz'jar}}|What hubrisss these fools possesssss!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Naz'jar|It ssshall profit them nothing, sssave it be a ssspeedy demise...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Naz'jar|Dessstroy them!}}
:''The ship catches fire, then crashes to the southwest of the breach. The crew escapes outside, barely.''


:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|Arise, friend. We have no time to lick our wounds!}}
:''Spotted, waves of naga start attacking!''
:{{text|yell|Nazgrim|On your feet! Naga attack!}}
:''The party fends off the wave, but doesn't make any progress. Realizing this, Nazgrim calls for help.''
:{{text|yell|Nazgrim|We must hurry! Do something, shaman!}}
:''Erunak blasts them to smithereens.''

:{{text|yell|Nazgrim|That sub's gunna blow! We have to move, now!}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|We must make our way to the crater!}}
:''The party moves closer, to the northeast.''


:{{text|yell|Nazgrim|More naga... make ready!}}
:''Another wave, but Erunak quickly tires of this.''
:{{text|yell|Erunak Stonespeaker|Enough!}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|We must make haste! The elementals cannot endure this siege.}}
:''Moving onward, the next wave is [[Lady Sira'kess]], who freezes the party in its tracks!''


:{{text|say|Nazgrim|Thrall's balls! I'm sick of fighting naga!}}
:{{text|say|{{NPC||Lady Sira'kess}}|Ahh, visitorsss!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sira'kess|What an unexpected sssurprise.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sira'kess|You mussst forgive me... I have no time to ssstay and play.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sira'kess|In my absssence, my sservantsss will... sssee to your needs.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Sira'kess|Do enjoy yourssselves!}}
:''{{NPC||Sira'kess}} summons in some tentacles, then turns and heads toward the breach, but Nazgrim charges her through and one-shots her!''
:{{text|yell|Nazgrim|I'll day someday, sea-witch...}}
:{{text|yell|Nazgrim|...but not today!}}


:{{text|yell|Erunak Stonespeaker|Neptulon's minions are growing desperate! We must hurry!}}
:''The party reaches the last ridge before the cliff of the Breach.''
:{{text|yell|Erunak Stonespeaker|This is it! The entrance to Neptulon's realm...}}
:{{text|yell|Nazgrim|Naz'jar and her honor guard... Fight for your lives!}}


:{{text|yell|Lady Naz'jar|Come, children of Azshara! At last, we lay claim to the Plane of Water!}}
:''The camera cuts away as Nazjar's forces attack. Finally, Neptulon himself appears out of the Breach!''
:{{text|yell|Lady Naz'jar|Go, my naga! Welcome the mighty Tidehunter to Azeroth!}}
:{{text|yell|{{NPC||Neptulon}}|You and your scaly worms are no match for me...}}
:{{text|yell|Neptulon|You've reached too far, serpent. You shall suffer greatly for your trespass!}}
:''Neptulon strikes, taking out a significant portion of Naz'jar's forces. The camera pulls back to show Neptulon and Naz'jar channeling beams of energy into each other, and more soldiers getting kidnapped again!''
:{{text|yell|Lady Naz'jar|To me, my minions! Strike now!}}
:''Naz'jar unleashes her trump, Ozumat!''
:{{text|yell|Lady Naz'jar|Now! Unleash the kraken!}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Naz'jar|You fool! This day shall be your last!}}
:''{{NPC||Ozumat}} attaches itself to Neptulon's "head" and Naz'jar celebrates her victory as the naga enter the breach.''
:{{text|yell|Lady Naz'jar|Follow me, my pets! The realm of the mighty Neptulon is ours at last!}}


:''Afterwards, Erunak and Nazgrim talk, floating at the edge of the breach.''
:{{text|say|Nazgrim|Well, shaman, what now?}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|We have suffered a tragic defeat.}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|Any hope for the future of our world has grown much bleaker.}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|{{NPC||Thrall}} must be told of this day's events.}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|He will guide our next steps...}}
:''A tentacle comes out of the breach and yanks Erunak down into it!''
:{{text|yell|Nazgrim|Erunak! Behind you!}}
Speak to Nazgrim to conclude the quest.


On complete:
:''Nazgrim swims down into the breach, which leads to the [[Abyssal Maw]].''
