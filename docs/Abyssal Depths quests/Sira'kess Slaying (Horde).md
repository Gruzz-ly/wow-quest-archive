== Objectives ==
Slay 15 Sira'kess Naga.
*Sira'kess naga slain x15

== Description ==
So, you're the infamous <name>? It's good to finally meet you.

Well, enough talk, right? Let's get down to it. I need you to swim out northwest to the [[Sira'kess Front]] and kill those naga real quick.

Nothing fancy. They're looking for a fight, and we'll give them one! Well, you will.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
This isn't going to be easy, but when they're dead, we'll have ourselves a strong drink.

Right?

== Completion ==
Nice, <name>! That will show those naga who's the boss!

Now it's time for that drink. You want rum or wine?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Standard Day for Azrajar]], [[Those Aren't Masks]] and [[Treasure Reclamation]] before heading out. Target location is way, way to the northwest, north of [[Promontory Point]] and to the west of the [[Abyssal Breach]]. Naga are everywhere on the ridge, both at the Sira'kess Front on the east end, or the gilgoblin territory on the west.
