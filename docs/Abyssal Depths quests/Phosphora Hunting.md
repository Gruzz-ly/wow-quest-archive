==Objectives==
Obtain 6 Underlight Phosphora from [[Pyreshell Crab]]s and [[Luxscale Grouper]]s in [[Underlight Canyon]].
*[[Underlight Phosphora]]

==Description==
[[Oskar Digsong|Oskar]]'s last wish, before he floated into that [[Devious Great Eel|great-eel's]] gullet, was to bring back food for the [[Captain Glovaal|captain]], so that's what we'll do.

My brother had a genius plan. He saw those [[deep sea murloc|murlocs]] luring fish out of the reeds with a phosphorescent antenna, and devised a way to make one of his own. All ya need is something that glows.

Kill the [[crab]]s and [[grouper]] that roam the canyon's floor. They aren't edible themselves, but their phosphora is far more valuable than their meat.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
We need enough phosphora to make a really bright light, especially if you're going to be competing with those murlocs.

==Completion==
<Humphrey grabs the phosphora from you and attaches it to an unusual device.>

There ya go. It's beautiful! Oskar would be proud.

==Notes==
Turn around to the southwest and start killing.
