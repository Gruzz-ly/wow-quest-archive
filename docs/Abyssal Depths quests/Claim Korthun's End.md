== Objectives ==
Kill 7 Hellscream Seadogs in [[Korthun's End]].
*[[Hellscream Seadog]] slain x7

== Description ==
;1

The Horde has spies in this area? [[Darkbreak Cove]] is nearby, and inside lies the ''[[Pincer X2]]''! The Horde must not be allowed anywhere nearby!

Someone in Darkbreak Cove will want to hear of this... after you finish slaying some more of these dirty Horde spies.


;2
You are seeink spies up above? This is not good... not good at all, comrade.

Return to Korthun's End and destroy them, my friend. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
You saw Horde spies up above? We must be rid of them, <name>!

== Completion ==
You did well, <name>. We need to be especially wary of Horde attacks right now. The ''Pincer X2'' has plenty of firepower at sea, but in the back of this cave, she is exceptionally vulnerable.

== Notes ==
Kill a Hellscream Seadog to automatically be offered this quest. Then kill 6 more. Version '''2''' of the quest was offered by [[Captain Glovaal]].
