== Objectives ==
Collect 10 Merciless Heads.
*[[Merciless Head]] x10

== Description ==
<Name>, there are these demon squid-things out there that are eating [[gilgoblin|gilblins']] heads and then taking them over! That's one way to get slaves.

Think you could swim out northwest onto [[Deepfin Ridge]] or into the [[Sira'kess Front]] and bring me back some of those {{NPC||Merciless One||Merciless things}}?

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
How many you got?

== Completion ==
Ah, they're ugly, but they mostly look harmless. Smelly though.

Here, let me clean the gilblin stuff out of these. I've got an idea...

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Sira'kess Slaying (Alliance)|Sira'kess Slaying]], [[A Standard Day for Azrajar (Alliance)|A Standard Day for Azrajar]] and [[Treasure Reclamation (Alliance)|Treasure Reclamation]] before heading out. Target location is way, way to the northwest, north of [[Promontory Point]] and to the west of the [[Abyssal Breach]]. Look for and kill {{NPC||Taken Gilblin}}. Killing them will pop off the {{NPC||Merciless One}}, which got killed in the process. Loot it to get the head.

==Progression==
