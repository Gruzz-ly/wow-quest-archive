== Objectives ==
Witness what occurs when you place the {{NPC||Merciless One}} on your head.
*Mindless One worn

== Description ==
Hey, <name>. I've got an idea for a disguise. Take one of these merciless whatchamacallits and put it on your head.

What could possibly go wrong?

Ready to put it on?

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Riptide Legguards|Severed Visionary Tentacle}}
You will also receive: {{cost|16|40}}

== Completion ==
What happened? That thing wasn't completely dead! Maybe I should stick to mechanical stuff.

It gave you a vision? Of killing all of us?! That doesn't sound good.

Well, in any case, that [[Earthen Ring]] fellow, {{NPC||Erunak Stonespeaker}}, wants these specimens all taken out to him. I'll make sure he gets them. I don't want them anywhere near me.

== Notes ==
Accept the quest and the world goes mad. The "Merciless One in Control of You" goes on a rampage attacking the lieutenant and Hexascrub, then Trueblade eventually knocks it off.

:{{text|say|Lieutenant "Foxy" Topper|This is marbles and conkers!}}
:''Then, a few random yells, followed by Jorlan's first, then a few more random yells followed by Jorlan's second, a last set of random yells and then Jorlan knocks the thing off. The Merciless One really does "yell" in purple.
