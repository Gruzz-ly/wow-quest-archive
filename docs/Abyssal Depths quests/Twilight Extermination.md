THEIR DEVOTIONS ARE... SILENCED.

NOW THAT... YOU HAVE... THEIR POWER... YOU MUST DESTROY... THEIR LEADER.

==Notes==
The [[Twilight's Hammer]] cultists in front of the ascendant are hostile, but have no aggro radius. Just run by them. Get within 30 yards one of the elementals and possess it. It has four abilities:
#{{abilities|Watery Doom|Visit a watery death upon the Twilight Devotees and Faceless Overseers within 40 yards for 18000 to 22000 damage.|notes=Instant}}
#{{abilities|Vortex|Creates a whirling vortex which sucks in Twilight Devotees and Faceless Overseers within 40 yards of the target.|notes=Instant|cd=8 sec}}
#{{abilities|Aquatic Shield|Plaecs a shield upon the caster, absorbing up to 50% of his max health in danage.|notes=Instant|cd=10 sec}}
#{{abilities|Consume Essence|range=50|Consumes the nearest Faceless Overseer, killing it and transferring 200% of its health to the caster.|notes=Instant|cd=10 sec}}
The elemental will regenerate health very quickly if outside of combat. So keep moving. The cultists, once attacked, respond with Shadow Bolts that hit for 1500-2000 and Corruption, but they will leash outside their fortified area, so get away from the temple once completing the quest.
