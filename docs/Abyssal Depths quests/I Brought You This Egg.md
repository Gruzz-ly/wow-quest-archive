==Objectives==
Deliver the Enormous Eel Egg to [[Orako]] at [[Coldlight Chasm]] in [[Vashj'ir]].
*[[Enormous Eel Egg]] (provided)

==Description==
<This appears to be an egg from one of the [[Devious Great-Eel|devious great-eels]] that float up above the chasm. You wonder whether or not Orako might be interested in something like this.>

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|90}}

==Progress==
<Blam!>

You brought me something?

==Completion==
That is a big egg.

<Orako sniffs it.>

It is big, and it smells like fish. Maybe the big fish that made this egg is the big fish that ate my wolf!

==Notes==
While killing [[deep sea murloc]]s for [[Here Fishie Fishie]] and [[Die Fishman Die]], one of them has the Enormous Eel Egg on its corpse. "You didn't know that fish eggs came in this size."
