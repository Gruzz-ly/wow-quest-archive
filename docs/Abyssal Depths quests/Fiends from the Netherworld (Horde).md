== Objectives ==
Slay 12 Nether Fiends.
*[[Nether Fiend]] slain x12

== Description ==
Those ogre magi inside the Undershell have summoned defenders: fleshling fiends from the netherworld.

I do not want to see these aberrations used against our forces. While you are in there, destroy all of them!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
Not all of the fiends have been destroyed.

== Completion ==
That's one less thing we need to think about during the final assault.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Unplug L'ghorek]] before heading out. Swim underneath L'ghorek to reach the Undershell. Then it's crazy-go-nuts time on the fleshbeasts.
