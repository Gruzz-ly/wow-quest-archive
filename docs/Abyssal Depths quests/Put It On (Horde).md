== Objectives ==
Witness what occurs when you place the {{NPC||Merciless One}} on your head.
*Mindless One worn

== Description ==
I've got an idea for a sweet disguise, but I'm going to need your help, <name>! Take one of these merciless corpses and put it on your head.

I know, I know, but it's dead, so what could possibly go wrong other than you smelling bad for a day or two?

Ready to put it on?

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Riptide Legguards|Severed Visionary Tentacle}}
You will also receive: {{cost|16|40}}

== Completion ==
My bad. My name is Fiasco for a reason. I should have known that thing wasn't completely dead, when it wiggled a little.

You say it gave you a vision? Of killing all of us?! That doesn't sound good.

Hrm, well that [[Earthen Ring]] fellow, [[Erunak Stonespeaker]], wants these specimens all taken out to him. I'll make sure they get out there. It's not like I want them stinking up the place around here.

== Notes ==
Accept the quest and the world goes mad. The "Merciless One in Control of You" goes on a rampage attacking the sergeant and Fiasco, then Toldrek eventually knocks it off.

:{{text|say|Sergeant Gertrude|This is crazy you idiots!}}
:''Then, a few random yells, followed by Toldrek's first, then a few more random yells followed by Toldrek's second, a last set of random yells and then Toldrek knocks the thing off. The Merciless One really does "yell" in purple.
