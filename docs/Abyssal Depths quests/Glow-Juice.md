== Objectives ==
Collect 6 gobs of Glow-Juice from {{NPC||Pyreshell Crab}}s and {{NPC||Luxscale Grouper}}s in [[Coldlight Chasm]].
*[[Glow-Juice]] x6

== Description ==
Shooting fish in a barrel is easy. Shooting fish in an ocean is a little harder.

Have you seen the [[deep sea murloc|murlocs]] down in the chasm, <class>? They don't shoot at all. They have little balls full of glow-juice on their heads that make the fish come to THEM. Hey, we should try that.

Go south, and kill the [[crab]]s and [[grouper]] in the chasm. They have lots of glow-juice on their skin. I've seen it!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
We need lots and lots of glow-juice.

== Completion ==
Hey, look at how glowy it is!

<Orako looks wistfully off into the distance.>

My wolf loved things that were glowy...

== Notes ==
Down into the chasm. Go killing crabs and grouper. Save the deep sea murlocs for later.
