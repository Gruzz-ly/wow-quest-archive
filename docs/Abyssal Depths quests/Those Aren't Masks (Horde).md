== Objectives ==
Collect 10 Merciless Heads.
*[[Merciless Head]] x10

== Description ==
<Name>, there are these demon squids out there that are eating gilblins' heads and then taking them over! They better not come in here!

Think you could swim out tnorthwest onto [[Deepfin Ridge]] or the [[Sira'kess Front]] and bring me back some of those Merciless things? Preferably dead, I think.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|8|20}}

== Progress ==
What's that smell?

== Completion ==
Ah, they're ugly, but they mostly look harmless. Mostly. They're almost cute in a way.

Here, let me clean the gilblin stuff out of thse. I've got an idea...

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Sira'kess Slaying]], [[A Standard Day for Azrajar]] and [[Treasure Reclamation]] before heading out. Target location is way, way to the northwest, north of [[Promontory Point]] and to the west of the [[Abyssal Breach]]. Look for and kill {{NPC||Taken Gilblin}}. Killing them will pop off the {{NPC||Merciless One}}, which got killed in the process. Loot it to get the head.

==Progression==
