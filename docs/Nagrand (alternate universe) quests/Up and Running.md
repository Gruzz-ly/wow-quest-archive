Collect the Assorted Engineering Parts, Prop Rotor, and Transmission Flywheel.
*[[Assorted Engineering Parts]]
*[[Prop Rotor]]
*[[Transmission Flywheel]]

==Description==
The Warsong struck us hard. We lost Telaar, but we have a rare opportunity to strike at the heart of the Warsong.

We need your wisdom and leadership to pull it off, <name>.

First though, we're going to get our survivors out of Telaar. My rangari are ready to strike. We just need to get you to them.

Thaelin has a copter that can get you to them. Unfortunately, his hands are full just trying to keep the infernal thing running.

Help him get it up and running?

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<name>, I can't tell you how great it is to see you.

==Completion==
For me? Really you shouldn't have.

Okay, this should do it.
