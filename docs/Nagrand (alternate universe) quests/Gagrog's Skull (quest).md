==Progress==
Deep in the forest of northern Nagrand is a giant Gronn known as Gagrog the Brutal. In case you're wondering, he didn't get his name by giving out free hugs... this Gronn is as savage and murderous as they come!

Now look, I'm not telling you to go try and hunt this thing down... that would be suicide... but if by some miracle you fight Gagrog and live, make sure you bring back his skull!
