==Objectives==
Defeat Captain Boomspark in the Ring of Trials.
*Speak with Guzrug to begin the fight
*[[Captain Boomspark]] slain

==Description==
You've been making a name for yourself in the arena, <name>!

Don't get too excited though...fame has its consequences! You've been challenged by an up-and-coming gladiator who is looking to make a name for himself, sound familiar?

Your next fight is against Captain Boomspark, a [[mercenary]] who came here to fight for the Iron Horde.

The Iron Horde ain't exactly throwing piles of gold around, so now he's here!

He's got a shredder, so watch out for the blades... and the fire too... especially the fire!

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|29|20|}}
*18,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I ain't ever seen anybody dismantle a shredder quite like that before!

You've made me a lot of money, <name>! Only the best gladiators survive this long in the arena; and yet, even with that in mind, there's still something different about you...

It's your eyes...they look as if they've stared death in the face a thousand times and never even blinked.

Take your cut of the profit and rest up, the biggest fight is still ahead!
