Defeat Roakk in the Ring of Trials.

==Description==
The final match is at hand, <name>! You've decimated all of the best challengers! There's nowhere to go from here but the very top...the reigning champion of the Ring of Trials!

The current champ is an arakkoa named Roakk the Zealot. Roakk is a lunatic! He says he's on some divine crusade for the sun or something.

Crazy or not, he's one of the most dangerous fighters I've ever seen and has even fought in the Highmaul Coliseum!

I'm not going to lie, you're probably going to die in there...good luck!

==Progress==
What are you doing standing around? Don't you hear the crowd screaming?

There's a championship waiting on you!

==Completion==
Long live the champ! I knew you could do it!

Could you hear the roar of the crowd in there? It shook the arena like thunder!

This is only the beginning! The Highmaul Coliseum awaits, and as the champion of the Ring of Trials you'll be expected to make an appearance!
