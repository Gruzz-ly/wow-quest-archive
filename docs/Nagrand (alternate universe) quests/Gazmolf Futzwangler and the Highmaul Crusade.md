==Objectives==
Speak with [[Gazmolf Futzwangler]].

==Description==
I'm here in Nagrand recruiting for the Steamwheedle Preservation Society. We're the archaeological branch of the [[Steamwheedle Cartel]].

We're here to collect all of the artifacts, relics, antiquities and oddities that Nagrand has to offer! Currently, we're hiring surveyors, excavators, adventurers... you name it!

If you're interested in getting your hands dirty, talk to Gazmolf Futzwangler over at Stonecrag Gorge. He's the goblin in charge of this expedition!

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|46|}}
*1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It's good to see that there's still an interest out there in real archaeology!

There's a lot of misconceptions out there about how archaeology is really done, but have no fear! The great and famous Gazmolf Futzwangler is here to educate you.
