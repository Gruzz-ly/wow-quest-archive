==Objectives==
Place 10 Ancient Snarlpaw Skulls in the [[Boneseer's Cauldron]].
*[[Ancient Snarlpaw Skull]] (10)

==Description==
Many years ago my family and I were slain in this very spot.

The [[saberon]] you see around you are descended from the [[Snarlpaw tribe|tribe]] that murdered my village. Long have I waited, here in this forgotten place, to see justice brought to the saberon for their crimes.

The Snarlpaw chief is a boneseer, a saberon who divines the future using the remains of the dead.

Collect the ancient skulls of the Snarlpaw ancestors and place them in the boneseer's cauldron.

Let their own bones fill their cauldron for once!

==Progress==
<The cauldron bubbles and boils.>

==Completion==
<The boiling cauldron gasps and spurts boiling liquid with each skull that is plunged into the pot.>

<As the last of the skulls is submerged within the bubbling cauldron, you feel the sharp nip of a ghostly breeze upon your skin.>

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|15||}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|Say|Murgok|I have seen the saberon strip the bones of the innocent. I have seen the remains of my clansmen cooked in their wretched cauldron. Now... it shall be the saberon whose bones are desecrated and boiled!}}

;On completion
:{{Text|Say|Murgok|You have honored the memory of my kin, <class>. Take this blessing with you on your journey, so that it may it guide your arm and swiften your step.}}
