==Objectives==
Stop Grand Magister Reglakk.
*[[Grand Magister Reglakk|Reglakk]] stopped

==Description==
These ogres have been using ancient Titan artifacts to empower a small cadre of specialized units called the Breakers. This Magister Reglakk is here studying ways to improve the process.

Let's put a stop to whatever rituals he has going up on the bluff.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Mighty Gorian Cleaver|

You will also receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*18,840 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That Felbreaker sounded tough! Good thing there's only a small number of them.

Nice job stopping Reglakk, but I'm sure he's safely back in Highmaul. The ogre capital will have to be dealt with sooner rather than later.
