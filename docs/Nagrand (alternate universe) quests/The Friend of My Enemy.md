==Objectives==
Kill 15 Burning Blade forces at Hallvalor.
*[[Blademaster Trainee]]
*[[Burning Flameseer]]
*[[Hallvalor Villager]]
*[[Burning Flameseer]]

==Description==
Hallvalor is the ancestral home of the Burning Blade clan. Since they're such fast friends, the Warsong have allowed the blademasters to remain in Nagrand.

We are fierce, but we won't win if the Burning Blade attack us. It would be wise to strike first.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A great victory over the Burning Blade!

This new Warlord Azuka Bladefury sounds formidable. We will have to keep an eye on her and her blademasters.
