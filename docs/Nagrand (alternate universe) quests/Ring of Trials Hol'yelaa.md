==Objectives==
Defeat Hol'yelaa in the {{Au|Ring of Trials}}.
*Speak with [[Guzrug the Tiny|Guzrug]] to begin the fight
*[[Hol'yelaa]] slain

==Description==
You won your first two fights, but it's only going to get tougher from here!

Your next fight is against Hol'yelaa, a former {{Au|rangari}} who is as crazy as they come.

No, really... Hol'yelaa is bonkers!

Years ago, while on a scouting mission, he single handedly saved his entire rangari unit from a pack of [[Garn]]. But something inside of him snapped....

It wasn't long before Hol'yelaa went completely marbles and turned on his own unit!

Alright, the pep talk is over! Get in there and kick some ass!

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|29|20|}}
*18,500 [[XP]]

{{Rfb-section}}
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Steamwheedle Draenor Expedition]]

==Progress==
What are you doing standing around? Get in the arena and spill some blood!

==Completion==
Watching you fight in the arena is like witnessing an artist create a masterpiece!

Well, a masterpiece of blood and shattered bones... but hey, everyone's got to be good at something right?

Here's your cut of the profit! That fight was so good I actually thought about giving you a bonus!
