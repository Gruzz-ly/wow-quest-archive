==Objectives==
Defeat the Darkwing Roc while riding your Talbuk-In-Training.
*[[Darkwing Roc]] Killed
*[[Silverpelt-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
The windrocs of Nagrand are a smart predator, often swooping down on unwary prey in packs. If your beast doesn't keep an eye on the sky, it's likely to lose both of 'em.

Head on out to Nagrand and take on the fiercest windroc of the bunch, the Darkwing Roc. That'll be a good test for the both of ye.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (20)

==Completion==
From now on, I'm sure your mount will always remember to keep one eye on the skies. Great job!

==Patch changes==
