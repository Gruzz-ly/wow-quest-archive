==Objectives==
Collect 10 Raw Windroc from windroc in Nagrand.
*[[Raw Windroc]] (10)

==Description==
You got a moment, <bub/beautiful>? I've got an elekk-sized problem.

Someone, um, sold me... yeah, sold me these two, but they're sick. I've tried everything, but nothing I do makes any difference!

I think they must be starving. I heard that elekk like raw windroc. Gross if you ask me.

Anyway, while you're out doing your thing, you mind picking me up some bird meat?

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|15||}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Windrocs? Yeah, Nagrand's filthy with them.

They seem to like high places and rock outcroppings.

I don't know. What do I look like - a windroc whisperer? You're the <class>.

==Completion==
It sure doesn't smell like chicken!

Okay, okay, hand it over. I'll feed them and then everyone will be happy and I can turn a tidy - er, um... they'll feel better.
