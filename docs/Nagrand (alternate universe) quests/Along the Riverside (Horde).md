==Objectives==
Speak with {{Au|Durotan}} at [[Riverside Post]].

==Description==
Durotan has taken most of our forces west. He's establishing a forward base along the [[Skysong River]].

He'll want to know that we're almost ready to move against [[Grommashar]].

I'm sure he'll also appreciate your help dealing with the {{Au|Warsong clan|Warsong}} orcs at [[Lok-rath]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,490 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It's good to see you, commander. When I'd heard about your garrison caravan being destroyed....

Well, let's just say that I feared the worst.

What word from [[Wor'var]]?

==Notes==
;Accept
:{{text|say|Thrall|We must defeat the [[ogre]]s, the {{au|Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade}}, and the orcs at [[Lok-rath]]. Then, we'll be ready to move on [[Grommashar]].}}
