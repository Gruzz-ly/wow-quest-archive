==Objectives==
Speak with the spirits at the {{Au|Ancestral Grounds}}.

==Description==
The spirits of the dead have long been drawn to the mountain of {{Au|Oshu'gun}}.

As long as I can remember, the woods have been filled with ancestral spirits making a ghostly pilgrimage to the heart of the mountain. I fear that the souls drawn to Oshu'gun are being consumed by the growing void within the mountain.

Make your way to the Ancestral Grounds and commune with the spirits there for guidance.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|15||}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The situation here is dire, <name>, but I sensed that we would meet again.

I do not hear the call of the void as loudly as the others, for I am not long dead and my body rests far from this place.

With time though, that will change.

If you are here to help, listen closely for time is short.
