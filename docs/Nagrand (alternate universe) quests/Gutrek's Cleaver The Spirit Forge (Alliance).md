==Objectives==
Locate the Spirit Forge in [[Earthshaker Gorge]] and reforge Gutrek's Cleaver.
*Locate the Spirit Forge
*[[Gutrek's Cleaver]]

==Description==
With the pieces recovered, all that is left is to reforge Gutrek's Cleaver. [[Val Goldspade|Goldspade]]'s journal seems to indicate that the only place to do this is the location where it was initially dismantled. The journal mentions a "Spirit Forge" used to dismantle the blade, and that it may be located somewhere in the nearby gorge. Find the forge and use it to combine the pieces you've gathered.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|150||22}}
*3,770 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find that old blade [[Harrison Jones|Dr. Jones]] was looking for?

==Completion==
This matches the description of what Dr. Jones was looking for. I'll make sure it makes it to him. 

Here is your reward, <class>.
