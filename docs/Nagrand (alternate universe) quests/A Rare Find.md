==Progress==
Every once in a while an archaeologist experiences a rare find... an artifact that time has delicately preserved through the ages, as if it had simply fallen out of a time machine.

Even thinking about the thrill of such a find makes me get all emotional... relics like that are worth a freakin' fortune!
