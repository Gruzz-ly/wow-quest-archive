==Objectives==
Defeat the Moth of Wrath while riding your Talbuk-In-Training.
*[[Moth of Wrath]] Killed
*[[Silverpelt-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
Deep in the forests of Nagrand are some beasts capable of evading almost any predator. The greatest of them all, the Moth of Wrath, is coated with a foul-smelling dust.

If the moth dust is enough to keep wolves at bay, it'll probably be a pretty good test for your talbuk. See if you can't keep it focused and take down that moth.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (20)

==Completion==
Glad to see you two make it back. It'll need a bit of time to brush that dust off.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
