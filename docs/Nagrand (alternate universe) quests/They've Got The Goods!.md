When you're done, make your way back to Pyxni at the [[Ring of Trials (alternate universe)|Ring of Trials]].

She'll make it worth your while...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Steamwheedle Preservation Society]]

==Progress==
Greexlex told you that the saberon stole our merchandise?

Well, what are you standing around for? Get your butt over to Sabermaw and get it back!

Time is money!

==Completion==
You recovered the merchandise? Fantastic!

<Pyxni rummages through the bags.>

It's all here too! I knew I could count on you! Here, take this reward.

You've earned it!
