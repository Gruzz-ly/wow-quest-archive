==Objectives==
Find the Blademaster's Banner in a [[Burning Blade Locker]].
*"Not Without My Honor"
*[[Blademaster's Banner]]

==Description==
The blade is not the only important item a [[blademaster]] carries.

Once he has passed his final tests in the [[Masters' Cavern]]s, the blademaster is given the honor of wearing the {{Au|Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade}}'s [[banner]].

When my petition to reclaim my rightful place with the clan fell upon deaf and craven ears, I was stripped of that honor.

No doubt, my banner has been stored away somewhere in [[Hallvalor]]. They'll give it to some other aspiring blademaster if they don't burn it first.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Beastrider Gloves		
|Plainsthunder Gauntlets	
|Windshaper Gloves		
|Stormsteppe Gauntlets}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have my banner?

==Completion==
I don't expect you to understand the importance of what you've done.

Perhaps one day you will.
