==Objectives==
Destroy the Portal to Highmaul.
*Portal to Highmaul destroyed

==Description==
My own investigations have uncovered a permanent arcane portal from here to Highmaul itself.

It is guarded but shouldn't be too hard to disrupt once you've gotten some breathing room.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
*15,070 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Excellent.  I doubt they will rebuild it after we've completed all of our objectives here.

This place will return to being a failing outpost for the Gorian Empire.

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2014-12-15|bluenote=Resolved an issue where the quest could not be completed if the character had already completed [[And Justice for Thrall (Alliance)]].}}
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
