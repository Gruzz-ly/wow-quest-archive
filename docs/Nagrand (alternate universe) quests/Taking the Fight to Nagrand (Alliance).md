==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lieutenant Balfor]] at the caravan in {{Au|Nagrand}}.
*Flight taken

==Description==
Commander, good to see you. With the fall of the rangari base at {{Au|Telaar}}, [[Vindicator Yrel]], recommended that we establish a new foothold in Nagrand.

I've taken the liberty of dispatching some of our men and supplies. [[Rangari D'kaan]]'s already reporting that the outpost is nearly complete. He asked me to let you know they are ready for you.

A [[gryphon]] is waiting to catch you up with the latest caravan shipment whenever you're ready, <sir/ma'am>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
They came at us... from... nowhere.

<The lieutenant nearly passes out.>
