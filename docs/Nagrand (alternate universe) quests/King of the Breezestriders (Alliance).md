==Objectives==
Collect Tall Buck's Tail from [[Tall Buck]].
*[[Tall Buck's Tail]]

==Description==
Let me guess, you found it in a [[talbuk]]'s flank?

<[[Rangari Laara|Laara]] seems lost in thought for a moment.>

That arrow was intended for Tall Buck, king of the Breezestriders. Another talbuk - the one you killed - jumped in the way as I was taking my shot.

I suggest you go after the king. When I was hunting him, he seemed fond of the pond at [[Lonely Falls]] to the south.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Plainsthunder Legguards|Windshaper Leggings|Stormsteppe Leggings|Beastrider Breeches}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*18,840 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt for Tall Buck?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. You succeeded where I did not.

Perhaps you outsiders aren't such bad hunters after all.
