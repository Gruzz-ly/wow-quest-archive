==Objectives==
Kill 15 Burning Blade forces at [[Hallvalor]].
*Burning Blade forces at Hallvalor slain (15)

==Description==
Hallvalor is the ancestral home of my clan, the {{Au|Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade}}. When the new warlord and his family came to power, I was exiled for being a half-breed.

I want justice.

I suspect you won't mind killing along the way. Not that you'll have any choice.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You done us a solid with them Burning Blade, lad, and we're not the forgettin' kind.

Let's celebrate o'er a pint in an hour. Drinks are on me.

==Notes==
Targets include [[Blademaster Trainee]]s, [[Burning Flameseer]]s and [[Hallvalor Villager]]s.
