==Objectives==
Destroy the Ritual Totems.
*Mok'gor totems destroyed (2)
*Gra'ah totems destroyed (2)
*Kag'ah totems destroyed (2)

==Description==
No longer do the Warsong seek to be one with the elements; instead they abuse their power by using it to channel the darkness of the void.

I will not tolerate these rituals to continue. Locate the ritual totems the Warsong use to channel the void and destroy them.

The gift of the elements was not given to the orcs only to be defiled and used as a plaything.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you destroyed the ritual totems?

==Completion==
Dark shamanism is a dangerous practice, <name>.

It is true that the void can be a source of terrible power, but it is the kind of power that comes at a price.

These woods are safer now that you have put an end to the rituals.

==Progression==
* [[Silence the Call]] / [[Disrupt the Rituals]]
