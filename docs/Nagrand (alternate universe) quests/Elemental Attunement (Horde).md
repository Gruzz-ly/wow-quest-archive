==Objectives==
Seek out the four elemental pillars.
*[[Pillar of the Earth (object)|Attune to the Earth]]
*[[Pillar of the Wind|Attune to the Wind]]
*[[Pillar of the Flame|Attune to the Flame]]
*[[Pillar of the Water|Attune to the Water]]

==Description==
Many [[shaman]] have sought the favor of the {{Au|Throne of the Elements|Throne of Elements}}.

Forming an elemental bond with the [[furies]] allows a shaman to not only know the will of the elements on {{Au|Draenor}}, but also tap into a great font of elemental power.

If you are to discover the truth behind {{Au|Gordawg}}'s disappearance, you will need to succeed where others have failed and undertake the Ritual of Binding.

First, you must prepare yourself. Seek out the elemental pillars upon the plateau and attune your spirit with the elements.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You have done well, <name>.

By linking with each of the four elemental pillars you have attuned your life energy with each of the elements on Draenor.

You are now ready to undertake the Ritual of Binding.

Speak to me when your work upon the {{Au|Elemental Plateau}} is finished, and we shall begin.
