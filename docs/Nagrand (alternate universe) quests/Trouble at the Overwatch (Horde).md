==Objectives==
Find [[Akrosh]] at [[Mar'gok's Overwatch]].

==Description==
Yesterday, I sent two of my best scouts to spy on the [[ogre]]s at Mar'gok's Overwatch.

I haven't heard back from them.

<name>, would you do me the honor of checking on them? I'm sure it's nothing; the Overwatch is a large fortification.

I'd feel better knowing they're okay.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,490 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm honored you're here to help, wolf-brother. Things here are worse than we thought.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
