==Objectives==
Motivate 8 Lazy Peons.
*[[Lazy Peon (Nagrand)|Lazy Peons]] motivated (8)

==Description==
We have a rare opportunity to strike at the heart of the Warsong. But, we need your wisdom and leadership.

The most important decision will be your choice between building a corral or a tankworks. This choice will setup our approach to the fight against the Warsong.

Thazz'ril will head up our building efforts. Will you give him a hand?

It looks like he's having trouble motivating his peons to work.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If there's one thing the Horde never seems to be short on, it's lazy peons.

==Completion==
I knew it was a mistake to bring these guys with me from the Valley of Trials.
