==Objectives==
Defeat Ironbore while riding your Clefthoof-In-Training.
*[[Ironbore]] Killed
*[[Icehoof-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
You have defeated foes in the sky and on land, and even in the rain. Next, you face beasts beneath your very feet.

The rockworm is a cunning predator, striking at prey from below the sands. Many beasts of Nagrand have grown wary of the rumbling of the earth. Take your mount on out to the sandy shores and test it against the elder worm Ironbore.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (20)

==Completion==
You stand strong, though the ground crumbles. Admirable.

Allow your mount to rest for the night.

==Progression==
