==Objectives==
Collect 10 Saberon Claws.
*[[Saberon Claw]] (10)

==Description==
These [[saberon]] freaks have cost me a lot of money, <class>.

I'm not one to forgive a debt and it's time to collect!

The saberon that have been causing us the most trouble are the ones living in [[Sabermaw]]. They keep ambushing our trade shipments along the road.

<Pyxni grins.>

It's time to declaw the competition. Bring me their claws; we'll sell the best ones as good luck charms here at the arena.

If the claw sales don't cover their debt, we'll just have to charge them an arm and a leg too!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Steamwheedle Preservation Society]]

==Progress==
Do you have the saberon claws I asked for?

==Completion==
<Pyxni examines the saberon claws.>

We're gonna make a killing selling these as good luck charms to all the wannabe gladiators here at the arena!

From now on, the saberon will think twice about messing with the [[Steamwheedle Cartel]]!
