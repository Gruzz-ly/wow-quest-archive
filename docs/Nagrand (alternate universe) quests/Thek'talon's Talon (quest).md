==Progress==
Windrocs can be found all over Nagrand, from the highest peaks to the lowest valleys. However, one windroc in particular is extremely elusive and is rarely sighted, it is known to the orcs as Thek'talon.

If I know anything, it's that people will pay a lot of money for anything that is rare or elusive!

Hey! That definitely looks like it belonged to Thek'talon, and even if it's not who's to say otherwise? Great work, here's your cut!
