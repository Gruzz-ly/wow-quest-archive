==Objectives==
Collect 12 Fungal Spores.
*[[Fungal Spores (Draenor)]] (12)

==Description==
The [[Zangar Shore]] is home to many peculiar strains of fungi, some of which are similar to those of our native [[Azeroth]]. However, one strain in particular is most fascinating!

I call it "Zangarium Draenormycota," due to its prevelance in {{Au|Draenor}}'s fungal ecosystem. This unique strain of fungus is highly adaptable and can be found on many of the living organisms throughout Zangar Shore.

Why does it exist? What properties does it hold?

To answer these questions, I will need additional spore samples.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the spore samples for my research?

==Completion==
You have the spore samples for my research! Excellent!

The Zangar Shore is a dangerous place... what with the risk of fungal mutation and all.

Oh... I didn't mention that part before? I was sure I did!

No matter! You look hardy enough, I'm sure your genes are impervious to foreign fungal strains that your body has never before encountered!
