The '''Fight, Kill, Salute!''' quest requires a Level 3 [[Gladiator's Sanctum]] building at the [[Garrison]] to unlock.

==Objectives==
Kill 100 Gladiators at the Coliseum in Highmaul.

You may access the Coliseum by talking to [[Kharg]] at Highmaul or [[Boneslag]] at your Gladiator's Sanctum.
* Gladiators slain (100)

==Description==
The greatest gladiators on Draenor have fought for glory and honor inside the Coliseum. Will you become a legend like [[Kargath Bladefist (alternate universe)|Kargath Bladefist]] or will you be nothing more than bone dust beneath the boots of a more savage gladiator? There is only one way to find out.

You must enter the competition and fight! The price of victory is 100 lives!

I will admit you without cost once per day, but if you fail and wish to fight again you must pay the price of admission in blood and bone!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|61|60|}}
*30,140 [[XP]]
*[[Coliseum Champion's Spoils]]
*1000x [[Apexis Crystal]]

==Completion==
Remarkable! You have proven yourself a true gladiator. And to a true gladiator goes more than honor and glory!
