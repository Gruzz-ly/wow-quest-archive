==Objectives==
Collect 8 Nagrand Antiquities.
* [[Nagrand Antiquity]] (8)

==Description==
The excavation team is on strike!

[[Foreman Thazwix]] and his cronies think they can squeeze the [[Steamwheedle Preservation Society]] for some extra dough by refusing to work.

What I need is a scab, a strikebreaker; someone to put some pressure on them by doing the job they refuse to do!

Go down into the gorge, dig up some antiquities for me, and I'll pay you what I would have payed those lazy numbskulls!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Garrison Resources]] (55)
*{{cost|14|60|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Steamwheedle Preservation Society]]

==Progress==
Do you have the Nagrand Antiquities?

==Completion==
Great work, <name>!

That bunch of good-for-nothing's came crying when they found out someone else was making their money! I don't think Thazwix, or his cronies, will be much trouble from here on out.

As promised, here's the pay I owe you for a job well done!
