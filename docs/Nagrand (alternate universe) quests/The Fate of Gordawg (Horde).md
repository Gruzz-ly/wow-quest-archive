==Objectives==
Retrieve the Heart of the Fury.
*[[Heart of the Fury (Nagrand)]]

==Description==
Looming monstrously between us and the inner chamber is the great [[Furies|fury]] we have sought to return to the {{Au|Throne of the Elements|Throne of Elements}}.

{{Au|Gordawg}} stands before us enthralled; a slave to the [[pale orc|pale]] and their {{Au|Cho'gall|mysterious master}}. My heart is heavy with grief to see such a great creature mindless and enslaved by evil.

There is no going back, in order to push forward you must go through Gordawg.

It pains me, but Gordawg must be slain.

When the deed is done, we will return the fury's heart to the Throne of Elements.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15||}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What of Gordawg? Has the great fury been brought to rest?

==Completion==
Gordawg was a mighty ally. The elements will mourn the loss of the fury, but death was the only answer. Gordawg would not have wished to stay a slave to evil.

Though Gordawg is no more, the heart of a fury is eternal and unbreakable. In time, this brightly glowing heart will take shape into a new earthen fury.

Such is the cycle of life upon the {{Au|Elemental Plateau}}.

==Notes==
The entrance to the underground cavern is located east of Oshugun at {{co|56|61|Nagrand (alternate universe)}} in [[Shadowfall Canyon]].
