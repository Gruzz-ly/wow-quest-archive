==Objectives==
Defeat the spirit of Golmash Hellscream.
*[[Golmash Hellscream]] slain

==Description==
Those who die in brutal combat often enter the spirit world in unrest. So it was with Golmash, father of Grommash Hellscream.

Crushed within the jaws of a hulking gronn, Golmash still found the strength to bury his axe Gorehowl deep into the eye of the monster. When they fell, it was the gronn who died first.

Such is the heroic death that every Warsong dreams of, yet few attain. But Golmash's mighty spirit lingers restlessly, stirring the other spirits into unrest.

Put his mighty soul to rest, <name>.

You will also receive:
*{{cost|30||}}
*18,660 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you brought peace to the spirit of Golmash Hellscream?

==Completion==
Golmash was a mighty warrior in life.

Few orcs have been as honored by their clans and feared by their enemies as the great Giantslayer... the father of the Hellscream name. With the mighty spirit of Golmash Hellscream finally put to rest, the ancestral grounds may once again be a place of peace and reverence.

You have our thanks, <name>.
