==Completion==
I am without a clan. The {{Au|Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade}} are dead to me. Perhaps someday I will create a clan of my own.

In the meantime, it would be an honor to fight at your side. You freed me and fought well.

There is much we could learn from each other. What do you say?

==Rewards==
You will learn: Follower: {{Au|Lantresor of the Blade}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Patch changes==
