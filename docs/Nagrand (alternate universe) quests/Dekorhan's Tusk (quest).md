Few elekk have lived as long as Dekorhan. Elekk tusks continue to grow throughout the elekk's lifetime.

This makes Dekorhan's tusks some of the largest and oldest on Draenor.

Do you hear what I hear, <name>? That's the sound of all the gold jingling in our pockets after you bring me Dekorhan's tusk!
