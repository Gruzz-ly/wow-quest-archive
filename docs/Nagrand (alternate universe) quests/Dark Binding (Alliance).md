==Objectives==
Free 8 elemental spirits.
*[[Elemental spirit]]s liberated (8)

==Description==
Even as we speak, the [[pale]] are enslaving an army of [[elemental]]s in [[Shadowfall Canyon]]. Many have already been enslaved and if we do not lend our aid, more will follow.

Go to Shadowfall Canyon and set free the elemental spirits which are not yet fully enthralled by the pale. As for those already enslaved, the only mercy we can give them now is a swift death.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
{{Stub-section|quest}}

==Completion==
You have done well to free the elemental spirits from their bonds. If {{Au|Cho'gall}} and the pale seek an army of elemental slaves, they must not be allowed to succeed.

==Progression==
{{The Dark Heart of Oshu'gun}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
