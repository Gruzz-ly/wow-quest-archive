==Objectives==
Retrieve the Ember Blossom from the {{Au|Elemental Plateau}}.
*[[Ember Blossom]] {{co|70.6|10|Nagrand (alternate universe)}}

==Description==
Many years ago I had a life-mate, [[Dahaka]]. We were only bound a short time before she was taken from me.

I have lived long, but I have never known greater pain than that day. I was young and my grief was great; the earth quaked beneath my rage. I laid her to rest upon this cliff.

It is here where I too will rest, but first a favor.

A rare bloom grows in a cave within the fiery, molten earth of the plateau. It was her favorite.

I would lay the flower upon her grave one last time before I die.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|14|60}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the Ember Blossom?

==Completion==
This is a fine Ember Blossom that you have brought to me. I know the danger you faced to retrieve it and I thank you.
