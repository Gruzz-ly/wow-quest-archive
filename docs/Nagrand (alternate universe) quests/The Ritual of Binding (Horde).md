*Speak with Kalandrios

==Description==
The time has come for you to undertake the Ritual of Binding, <name>.

This ancient, shamanic rite has been practiced since long before I was born. To be chosen is a great honor.

Many shaman see vivid elemental visions during the rite; experiencing this world through the very elemental bonds that hold it together.

When you are ready, speak with Kalandrios to begin the rite.

==Progress==
The wind is the voice of the elements, it whispers gently upon the breeze and howls fiercely within the storm.

{{gossip|I am ready to begin the Ritual of Binding.}}

==Completion==
<{{Au|Drek'Thar|Farseer Drek'Thar}} listens closely as you speak of your vision.>

I see... these are truly dark days. {{Au|Cho'gall}} has invaded the heart of {{Au|Oshu'gun}}, draining the naaru of its life. He seeks to destroy the [[naaru]], birthing a dark, void god in its place.

Cho'gall must be stopped. Come, we must travel to the sacred mountain before it is too late.

==Notes==
''From a view across the trees, your vision lowers into a cave, flying through it. Then the scene switches to {{Au|Cho'gall}} transforming {{Au|K'ure}} into a [[void god]]. {{Au|Gul'dan}} appears.''
