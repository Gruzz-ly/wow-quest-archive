==Objectives==
Defeat Maimclaw while riding your Talbuk-In-Training. 
*[[Maimclaw]] Killed
*[[Silverpelt-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
The last test for your mount will pit it against one of the great terrors of this land.

The garn. Wolves as black as night, and twice the size of a normal wolf, they can tear an orc apart in mere moments. The beasts here wisely fear them.

There is a lone garn that calls Nagrand its home. Take your talbuk, mount up, and bring it down. If the two of you survive, your talbuk will truly be ready for war.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (50)
*[[Trained Silverpelt]]

==Completion==
A powerful and swift companion, and now unafraid of the creatures you may run into. You have done well in your training of the beast, and I am pleased to present you with the reins.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
