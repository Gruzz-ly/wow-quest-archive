==Objectives==
Speak with [[Gar'rok]].

==Description==
Since the beginning, a shaman has been called to serve the {{Au|Throne of the Elements|Throne of Elements}} as its keeper. It is a lifelong calling and a new keeper is only called after the last has passed on.

[[Gar'rok]] has been our loyal keeper for many years, cleansing the {{Au|Elemental Plateau}} during countless cycles of rebirth.

Our keeper is dying, and soon another will be called in his place. When he passes, he should not be alone. Go to him, <name>.

Ease his pain.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|14|60}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
{{Au|Kalandrios}} sent you to me? I am honored.

The furies are wise, they know the burdens of my heart.

You may not know, but you have been sent to grant a last request to a dying shaman.

For this, I am grateful.
