==Objectives==
Kill Greyseer and 6 Pale orcs.
*[[Greyseer]] slain
*Pale orcs slain (6)

==Description==
The Pale are wretched creatures that hide beneath the ground, ever plotting against those who dwell upon the surface. They stalk the {{Au|Underpale}}, a twisted and dark cavern beneath {{Au|Oshu'gun}}.

If we are to succeed in stopping {{Au|Cho'gall}} we must fight our way through their ranks beneath the earth.

Make your way into the cavern, slay the vile creatures within and take out the Pale leader... the one known as Greyseer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15||}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I have encountered evil in many places, <name>. Even deep within my own soul, I have seen dark shadows of what could be.

However, the evil within the hearts of the Pale defies explanation. It is dark, loathing, and miserable in a way I have never encountered.

==Progression==
