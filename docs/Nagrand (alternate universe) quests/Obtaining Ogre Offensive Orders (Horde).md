==Objectives==
Collect Crulgorosh's Orders and Thulgork's Orders at [[Mar'gok's Overwatch]].
*[[Crulgorosh's Orders]]
*[[Thulgork's Orders]]

==Description==
The upper bluff must be really important to the [[ogre]]s. Two fancy looking ogre mages came down from there and starting ordering all the others around.

Go get those orders and meet up with my scout [[Dalgorsh]] on the upper bluff. They will be more useful to him up there.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|15||}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't forget! Get the orders and take 'em to Dalgorsh further in.

==Completion==
Finally some help! I barely got out alive!

You have some ogre orders? Let me see...

Well that's not good news.
