==Objectives==
Stop Grand Magister Reglakk's research.
*Reglakk stopped

==Description==
Okay so these orders say Reglakk is in charge of something called Breaker research, which makes super powerful ogres. I don't know about you but that sounds bad.

I'm pretty hurt, do you think you can go up there alone and make Reglakk rethink his research?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Mighty Gorian Cleaver|

Mighty Gorian Headcracker}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*18,840 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We stopped him for the time being, but I think we'll have to come up with a more permanent solution. No doubt he's back in Highmaul plotting new versions of Breakers.

I think a visit to ogre capital is far overdue.

==Patch changes==
