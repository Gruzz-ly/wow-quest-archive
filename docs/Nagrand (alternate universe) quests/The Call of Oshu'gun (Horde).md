==Objectives==
Fly to the Spirit Woods.
*Speak with [[Gixmo Moneycash]] {{co|73.7|26.7|Nagrand (alternate universe)}}
*Meet {{Au|Drek'Thar}} in the [[Spirit Woods]]

==Description==
The elements have spoken and a vision has been revealed, <name>.

Together we shall travel to the great mountain {{Au|Oshu'gun}} and put an end to the dark disturbance there.

If what you saw in the vision is to be believed, then great danger awaits us.

I will meet you in the Spirit Woods at the foot of Oshu'gun. When you are ready to depart, speak with Gixmo Moneycash and he will fly you there.

:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|I will meet you in the Spirit Woods near Oshu'gun. Cho'gall must be stopped!}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|14|60}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
It has been many years since I have set foot within these woods.

I was last here for the Kosh'harg many years ago when this place was shared amongst all clans. Those days have past and now only the Warsong banner flies here.

==Notes==
Speaking with Gixmo Moneycash:

{{Dialogue|
If you've got the cash, I've got the ride!
