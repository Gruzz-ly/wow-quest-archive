==Objectives==
Free 10 elemental spirits.
*[[Elemental spirit]]s liberated (10)

==Description==
Even as we speak, the [[pale]] within [[Shadowfall Canyon]] are enslaving the elements to their will. Many elemental spirits have already been enthralled, and more will follow.

The pale must be stopped and the elementals they enslave set free.

Journey into Shadowfall Canyon and set free those elemental spirits which are not fully enthralled by the pale. As for the elementals already enslaved by the pale, the only mercy we can give them now is to release their bonds through death.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you freed the elemental spirits of Shadowfall Canyon from the dark bonds of the pale?

==Completion==
The pale have been taught by {{Au|Cho'gall}} to enslave the elemental spirits of this land. When an elemental is enthralled in this manner, it cannot be reversed even by a Farseer such as myself.

==Progression==
{{The Dark Heart of Oshu'gun}}
