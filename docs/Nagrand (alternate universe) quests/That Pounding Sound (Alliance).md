==Objectives==
Collect 12 Pairs of Leatherhide Ears from Leatherhide clefthoof.
*[[Pair of Leatherhide Ears]] (12)

==Description==
Commander. The rangari and I were just discussing the merits of various 'hunting' approaches.

I assured her that the SI:7 are well-equipped to deal with any situation, even ones out in the wild.

She seems to think that we don't know what we're doing when it comes to bringing down game in 'her land.'

We're not going to let her get away with saying that, right? Let's take down some clefthoof.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Plainshunter Claws|

Plainshunter Blackjack|		
Plainshunter Dowsing Rod|	
Plainshunter Shademaker|		
Plainshunter Sunbarrier}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's unbelievable how arrogant these rangari can be.

==Completion==
Twelve pairs, huh? That's pretty good, commander.

Um, no, I think that's about how many I managed to bag. Yeah... about a dozen pairs of ears. Yep....
