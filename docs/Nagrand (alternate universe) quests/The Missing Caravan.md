==Objectives==
Find the missing trade shipment.

==Description==
I've got a problem and you look like you're just the <race> for the job!

A trade shipment was supposed to arrive yesterday, but it's nowhere to be found. I'm running low on merchandise here and I need somebody to go find out what happened!

If I were to guess, I'd say the [[saberon]] are probably involved. Those brutes have been a pain in our side ever since we got here!

Search for the wagon on the road near [[Sabermaw]] and hurry! Time is money!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|46|}}
*1,480 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Steamwheedle Preservation Society]]

==Completion==
<Greezlex lifts his head to look up at you from the ground.>

...No! Don't take me... I... wait...

You aren't a saberon... did Pyxni send you?
