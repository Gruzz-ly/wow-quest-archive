==Objectives==
Retrieve Lantresor's Blade from [[Instructor Luhk]].
*[[Lantresor's Blade]]

==Description==
When they clapped me in irons, the {{Au|Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade}} instructor, Luhk the Keen-Eyed, took my blade. He's an honorable [[orc]], even if his training techniques are counter-productive.

I want my blade back, <class>. Then, I'll break myself free.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|29|20|}}
*18,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A [[blademaster]] without a blade is no blademaster at all.

==Completion==
If you can defeat Luhk, then perhaps there's some hope for you after all.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
