==Objectives==
Defeat Raketalon in the Ring of Trials.
*Speak with Guzrug to begin the fight
*Raketalon slain

==Description==
You may have defeated Crushmaul, but the party's over now...you've got another fight!

The Highmaul take gladiatin' seriously; so when they built the Ring of Trials, they searched far and wide for the most brutal creatures they could find!

You're up against a dread raven the ogres are calling Raketalon! I'm telling you, <name>, something about that bird just ain't right...I think it truly enjoys the act of killing!

Raketalon toyed with the last gladiator for hours before eating him.

Try not to die!

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|29|20|}}
*18,500 [[XP]]
*+350 reputation with Steamwheedle Draenor Expedition

==Progress==
What are you waiting for? Get in the arena and start spilling blood!

==Completion==
You did it, <name>! Raketalon has actually been defeated!

I'd never have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my very own two eyes. You've got a fire in your belly and dollar signs in your eyes, kid!

Here's your cut of the profit, but don't stop now! You're on a roll!
