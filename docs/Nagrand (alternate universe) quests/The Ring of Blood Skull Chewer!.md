==Description==
Welcome to Nagrand's one and only Ring of Blood, where hopefuls become gladiators and gladiators become discarded piles of meat on the arena floor!

Talk to me to start a fight, hop down into the ring, and fight for your life. It's positively brutal - and the crowd loves it!

You'll face off against an ogron that has a hankering for freshly severed heads. You'll be fine... and I'll be rich!

==Completion==
Nicely done, pal. Now how's about we kick things up a notch?
