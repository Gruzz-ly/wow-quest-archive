==Description==
We're going to get some payback on that little stinker.

Put the baby goren into one of those carriers and then make a special delivery to Thaelin.

==Completion==
Wait a minute, <name>... let's be reasonable. I can hear what's in that carrier.

It was just a harmless prank.

Don't do it, please!

Stop!

Don't open that carrier!
