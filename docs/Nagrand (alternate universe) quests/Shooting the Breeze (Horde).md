==Objectives==
Collect 24 Breezestrider Horns from Breezestrider talbuk.
*[[Breezestrider Horn]] (24)

==Description==
[[Shadow Hunter Taz|Taz]] and I are having a spirited debate over who kills more efficiently: [[shadow hunter]]s or [[Frostwolf Orcs|frostwolves]].

Care to get in on the wager, commander?

I've been focusing on [[talbuk]] because of their fierce majesty. They truly encapsulate the grandeur of {{Au|Nagrand}} as any native of {{Au|Draenor}} knows.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15||}}
*14,930 [[XP]]
*[[Garrison Resources]] (40)

==Progress==
This outsider really thinks he can come here and best me in my own land?

Oh... sorry, commander. Present company excluded, of course.

==Completion==
Twenty-four, huh? That's fine work.

I brought back fifty.

I'll send someone out for the meat. Waste not, want not.
