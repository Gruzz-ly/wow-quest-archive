==Objectives==
Deliver the [[A Molten Core|Molten Core]] to {{Au|Incineratus}}.

==Description==
The molten core appears to be the mutated remains of an elemental that consisted of both earth and fire.

[[Slag elemental]]s should not exist upon the plateau where the elements live in purity.

You decide that the core should be taken to Incineratus at the {{Au|Throne of the Elements|Throne of Elements}} for examination.

Perhaps the great fury of fire will know what to make of this core and your battle with [[Magmire]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Incineratus examines the core as you explain the circumstances behind its acquisition>

Indeed, slag elementals should not exist upon the plateau. The plateau has grown unstable, causing the elemental spirits there to devolve and mutate.

So long as an earthen fury is absent from the throne, the imbalance in the elements will worsen.

{{Au|Gordawg}} must return to the Throne of Elements if balance is to be maintained.

==Progression==
{{The Dark Heart of Oshu'gun}}

==Patch changes==
