==Objectives==
Commune with the [[furies]] at the {{Au|Throne of the Elements|Throne of Elements}}.
*Speak with {{Au|Drek'Thar|Farseer Drek'Thar}}
*Commune with the furies

==Description==
It was not long after I arrived in {{Au|Nagrand}} that the voice of {{Au|Kalandrios}} called out to me upon the wind.

It is a great honor to be called to the Throne of Elements, but my heart was heavy sensing the purpose.

There is dark malaise in the air, it can be felt all around us. It surrounds all life here...enveloping...smothering...

Come, it is time we commune with the furies and lend them our aid. An invisible shadow has been cast upon this valley and it may be up to us to remove it.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|1|46|}}
*1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I fear that this disturbance is more dire than I had anticipated.

Whatever it is...it threatens to unravel the elemental bonds that hold this world together.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|When you are ready, I will commune with the great furies.}}

Speak to Drek'Thar:
{{dialogue|This is the Throne of Elements.

You stand in the presence of furies, <name>. Here, the earth lives beneath your feet and the wind watches your every move.

This is truly hallowed ground.
