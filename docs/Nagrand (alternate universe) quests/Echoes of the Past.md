==Objectives==
Slay 8 Tormented Echoes.
*Tormented Echoes slain (8)

==Description==
When a spirit is consumed by the void, an echo of the soul is all that is left behind.

Neither in the physical or spiritual sense of the word would these echoes be considered 'alive.' The echo is merely a twisted reverberation of the anguish left behind by the soul as it is consumed.

If left unchecked, the echoes will lash out against the living and stir the spirits of the dead from their graves.

In order to restore peace to the Ancestral Grounds, these echoes must be put to rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Do not mourn the twisted echoes of the dead, they are merely the distorted reflections of once noble spirits.

Instead, mourn the loss of those souls consumed by the dark void that grows within Oshu'gun.
