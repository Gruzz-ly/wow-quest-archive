==Objectives==
Summon and defeat [[Invalidus]].
*Invalidus slain

==Description==
The moment has come to take on the [[Voidlord|void lord]]. Invalidus grows more powerful by the minute, so you must move with haste if you are to defeat the monster.

At each of the [[Warsong clan (alternate universe)|Warsong]] ritual locations there is a [[void]] crystal; these crystals are used to channel the energy of the void from within the [[Twisting Nether]].

Disturb the crystal, and Invalidus will sense your presence below.

Be ready, as soon as the crystal is disturbed, Invalidus will waste no time hunting you down.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Beastrider Gauntlets

You will also receive:

*14930 [[XP]]

==Progress==

==Completion==
With Invalidus destroyed and the Warsong rituals halted, the threat of the Twisting Nether has subsided.

==Progression==
* [[Silence the Call]] / [[Disrupt the Rituals]]
