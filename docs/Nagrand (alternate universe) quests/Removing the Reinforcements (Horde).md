==Objectives==
Destroy the Portal to Highmaul.
*Portal to Highmaul destroyed

==Description==
Its{{sic}} not good <name>, these smart ogres have got a portal working up there and they are bringing in more ogres from somewhere else.

It looks like it takes a lot of effort to keep it open though. If you take it down I'm guessing they will be delayed quite a while.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,070 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good, hopefully they will give up on making a portal here.

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2014-12-15|bluenote=Resolved an issue where the quest could not be completed if the character had already completed [[And Justice for Thrall (Horde)]].}}
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
