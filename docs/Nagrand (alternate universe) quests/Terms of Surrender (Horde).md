==Objectives==
Address [[Uruk Foecleaver]] at [[Lok-rath]].

==Description==
I have good news, commander: we've already taken Lok-rath.

<The warchief grins.>

The Horde's soldiers have captured most of the Warsong, including their leader, Uruk Foecleaver.

I saved the honor of accepting his surrender for you. They're waiting for you inside, commander.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1510 [[XP]]

==Progress==
On one side, our enemy, the Warsong. On the other, our more ancient foe, the ogres of [[Highmaul]].

We must bring both to justice. We must rid Nagrand of their very presence.

==Completion==
Commander <name>.

<Uruk Foecleaver looks at you and grins.>

Terms of surrender? Hmm... let me think.

==Notes==
