==Description==
The plains of Nagrand are the most lush and fertile that I have ever seen. Should you ever see them, you will come upon the mightiest beasts that this place has to offer.

Among them, the great elekk. A magnificent beast with horns that can grow larger than you or I.

Here is another rope, should you wish to tangle with such a beast.

A powerful creature, it nearly took down the wooden posts of the stable. We will begin training it as soon as it wakes.
