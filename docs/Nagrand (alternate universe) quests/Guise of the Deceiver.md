==Objectives==
Speak with {{Au|Challe}} to discover the truth.
*Speak with Challe
*Challe defeated

==Description==
In a cave not far from here, there lives an old woman named Challe.

I knew Challe many years ago when I was young; though as I have become old and grey, she has kept her youth and beauty.

Challe was jealous of my love for [[Dahaka]] and I have long suspected that Challe had a part in her death. However, without evidence I could not bring justice against her.

Meet with Challe and tell her that I am dying. Tell her that I wish to know the truth of Dahaka's fate before I leave this world.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I have not much time left. Please, discover the truth of Dahaka's death before it is too late.

==Completion==
Challe, that iniquitous wretch!

If only I had proof of her treachery long ago, I would have ripped the villainous heart from her chest and crushed it beneath my foot!

You have brought me the truth as I asked, for that you have my thanks.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Gor'rok|I have always suspected Challe, but I have not had the proof necessary to bring justice upon her.}}

;Speaking with Challe
:I don't see many visitors all the way out here. It is so very nice to have a guest.

:Will you be staying for dinner?

:{{gossip|I wish to know the truth about Dahaka. What do you know of her death?}}

:{{text|say|Challe|So that poor fool Gar'rok is dying and wishes to know the truth?}}
:{{text|say|Challe|I remember Dahaka. She was as you see me now...}}
:{{text|say|Challe|...until I drained the life from her wretched body!}}
:{{text|yell|Challe|Gar'rok is a fool! I would have shared this power with him!}}
:{{text|yell|Challe|I will devour you!}}
:{{text|yell|Challe|Cower before my true power!}}
