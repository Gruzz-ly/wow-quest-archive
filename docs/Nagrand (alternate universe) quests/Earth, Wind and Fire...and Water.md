==Objectives==
Collect 4 of each living essence from the {{Au|Elemental Plateau}}.
*[[Living Earth]] (4)
*[[Living Wind]] (4)
*[[Living Flame (quest item)]] (4)
*[[Living Water (item)]] (4)

==Description==
The Elemental Plateau has become unstable, and so the cycle of rebirth must begin.

It is a natural part of our life cycle that impurities are accumulated in the elemental body over time.

When enough contamination has taken place, an elemental will become unstable and in some cases volatile.

A necessary part of rebirth is pure, living essence which can be found atop the Elemental Plateau, as well as in the body of an elemental spirit.

Return to me with the essence and we shall begin the rebirth.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Seal of the Ancient Flame		
|Seal of Rushing Winds	
|Seal of the Rising Tides	
|Seal of Falling Snow	
|Seal of Rumbling Earth}}

You will receive:
*{{cost|29|20|}}
*18,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Bring to me the living essences of the elements, that I may plant the seeds of rebirth.

==Completion==
You have done well.

Although the Elemental Plateau is no longer stable, the cycle of rebirth will soon take place and the elements will be born anew.

==Progression==
{{The Dark Heart of Oshu'gun}}
