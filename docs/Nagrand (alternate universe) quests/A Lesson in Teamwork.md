==Objectives==
Retrieve 10 Mysterious Artifacts.
* [[Mysterious Artifact (Draenor)]] (10)

==Description==
One of the most important skills an archaeology team needs is good teamwork. The key to teamwork is knowing when to give and when to take.

The [[Highmaul clan (alternate universe)|Highmaul]] [[ogre]]s have been excavating mysterious artifacts from the gorge. I want you to team up with the Highmaul ogres in the name of good archaeology!

Remember what I said about giving and taking? The ogres have given us their hard work to excavate the artifacts. Now I want you to take those artifacts from them and bring them here!

It's teamwork!
