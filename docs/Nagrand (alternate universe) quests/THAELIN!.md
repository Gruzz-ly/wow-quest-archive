Capture 15 Baby Goren.

==Description==
That little...!

<Yrel tries to maintain her composure.>

Thaelin Darkanvil sent us a shipment. It was supposed to be engineering parts.

Instead, when we just opened one of the crates, out popped a baby goren. Do you know how destructive those things are?

And, of course, the one baby immediately set about letting all the other ones loose.

Want to help me get some revenge?
