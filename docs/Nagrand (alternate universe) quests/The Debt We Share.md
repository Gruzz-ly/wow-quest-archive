==Objectives==
Speak with [[Gar'rok]].
*Witness the passing of Gar'rok

==Description==
These mortal shells that we call bodies are not ours to keep. The body is a gift of earth that must one day be returned from whence it came.

The time has come for this body to return to the elements.

Know that you have lifted the weight from an old heart, <name>. As I pass on from this realm, I do so without regret. I have fought on behalf of my people and my land, I have served the elements, and I have loved.

It would honor me if you would stay during these final moments, <class>.

*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
When I face my ancestors in the realm of spirits I will do so without shame or fear, for I have lived an honorable life.

==Completion==
[[Gar'rok]] was a loyal keeper and a true friend. He will be missed, but so is the cycle of life on this world.

In time we will call a new keeper of the elements, and he will serve us as Gar'rok did before him.

==Notes==

;Speak to Gar'rok
{{Dialogue|
I am a shaman of the old ways and I care not for the petty conflicts between clans.

Throughout the years many clans have called this valley home, but it has always belonged to the elements first.

{{Gossip|I stand with you, Gar'rok. Rest with honor.}}
