THEY STOLE MY MOST PRIZED POSSESSION!

You've got to help me get it back! I watched them drag it into [[Sabermaw]] and up that giant hill!

Who knows what those filthy saberon will do to it!

Please, I'm just a kid! You've got to help me out, right?

==Notes==
[[File:Bazwix's Treasure.jpg|thumb|Bazwix's Treasure]]
Bazwix shows up and starts following the player around as soon as they enter Sabermaw after they've accepted [[Gobnapped]] and/or [[They've Got The Goods!]]. Upon accepting his quest:
:{{Text|say|Bazwix|This will be the adventure of a lifetime!}}

[[Bazwix's Treasure]] is found up among the cliffs at {{Coords|74|60|Nagrand (alternate universe)}}, just outside [[Razorpaw]]'s cave. Upon interacting with the treasure, Bazwix will walk up to it and look at it in awe while hearts appear over his head.
:{{Text|say|Bazwix|You found it! Roxxie Rocketgrip...Bombshell Belle...they're all here!}}
:{{Text|say|Bazwix|My precious...}}

Talk to Bazwix again to turn in. On completion:
:{{Text|say|Bazwix|See you around, <name>! You can be my sidekick anytime!}}
:''Bazwix runs off and despawns.''

==Patch changes==
