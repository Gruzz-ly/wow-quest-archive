==Objectives==
Destroy the corrupted guardians atop the {{Au|Elemental Plateau}}.
*[[Unstable Earth Guardian]] slain
*[[Corrupted Wind Guardian]] slain
*[[Volatile Flame Guardian]] slain
*[[Tainted Water Guardian]] slain

==Description==
The Elemental Plateau is sanctuary to the elemental spirits of {{Au|Nagrand}}.

The greatest among the elementals on the plateau are the guardians; mighty elemental spirits that stand watch over their domain.

The guardians are pure and mighty spirits but a disturbance in the natural balance has caused them to grow unstable, corrupting the lesser elementals around them.

In order to restore balance to the plateau, the guardians must be destroyed. Only then will the cycle of rebirth begin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Each of the guardians you put to rest were once mighty and noble elemental spirits.

In time each shall be reborn anew through the cycle of rebirth, but {{Au|Gordawg}} must be found and balance restored lest the plateau become unstable yet again.

==Notes==
