==Objectives==
Slay Kuhlrath and 10 Warsong shaman.
* [[Ritualist Kuhlrath]] slain
* {{Au|Warsong clan|Warsong}} [[shaman]] slain (10)

==Description==
The Warsong clan, in their lust for dominance, have turned to the darkness of the [[void]] for power. [[Dark shaman]]ism is a loathsome, dangerous practice that abuses the elemental gift I have bestowed upon them.

There is one among the Warsong that calls out the loudest to the void, an elder shaman named Kuhlrath. Slay him and the rest of his dark shaman.

I will not allow the Warsong to abuse the elements and desecrate tradition.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Kuhlrath's Cursed Totem
|Void-Touched Totem

}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15||}}
*14930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you put an end to the Warsong ritualists?

==Completion==
The gift of shamanism is not one to be taken lightly. When the gift is abused, the elements will rise up in indignation and smite the shaman.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Warsong Axe-Singer]]s and [[Warsong Windcaller]]s.
