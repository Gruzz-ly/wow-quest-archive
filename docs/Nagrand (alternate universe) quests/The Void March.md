==Objectives==
Destroy 10 Void Terrors and 15 Void Tendrils.
*[[Void Terror (Nagrand)|Void Terror]] slain (10)
*[[Void Tendril (Nagrand)|Void Tendril]] slain (15)

==Description==
Hidden behind the veil of the [[Twisting Nether]], the abominations of the [[void]] march upon {{Au|Oshu'gun}}. The great void growing deep within the mountain has drawn them like moths to a flame.

Wave upon wave, the creatures of the void march upon the mountain and sacrifice themselves to [[Invalidus]]. The void lord Invalidus cannot be allowed to feast upon the other void creatures, else it will become too powerful to stop.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The void lord must be stopped. Thanks to your effort, the tide of void creatures has waned... but if we are to defeat Invalidus we must act swiftly.

==Progression==
* [[Silence the Call]] / [[Disrupt the Rituals]]
* [[Through the Nether]]
* [[The Nether Approaches]] / [[The Void March]]
* [[The Shadow of the Void]]

==Patch changes==
