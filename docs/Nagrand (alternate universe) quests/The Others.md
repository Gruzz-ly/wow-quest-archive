==Objectives==
Rescue Arbiter Khan, Caregiver Felaani & Isel, and Hansel Heavyhands.
*[[Arbiter Khan]] rescued
*[[Caregiver Felaani]] & [[Isel]] rescued
*[[Hansel Heavyhands]] rescued

==Description==
There are yet a few survivors. I saw them pile onto Arbiter Khan during the fighting.

More importantly, I can hear little Isel's sobs. She's nearby. I hope her mother is still alive.

Your dwarf friend, Hansel, came in to try to rescue us. He thought he could take the Warsong on his own. I'm afraid I don't know what happened to him.

==Completion==
Khan! No!... he just received his promotion. His whole life ahead of him and now, nothing.

Thank you for getting the others out. Light be... nevermind.

==Rewards==
You will also receive: {{cost|14|60|}}

==Gains==
*14,800 [[XP]]
