==Objectives==
Collapse 6 [[Void Portal (Nagrand)|Void Portals]].
*Void Portals collapsed (6)

==Description==
By connecting with the [[Twisting Nether]], the [[Warsong clan (alternate universe)|Warsong]] [[shaman]] have created a ripple effect that they could not have anticipated.

Look around and you will see countless portals beginning to open, signs that the Twisting Nether seeks to connect to {{Au|Draenor}}.

Should these portals successfully open, the path will be clear for all manner of [[demon]]s and [[void]] creatures to rampage across this valley.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15||}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Completion==
If those portals were to fully expand and open, the path would have been clear for the horrors of the Twisting Nether to march upon {{Au|Nagrand}}.

The Warsong have been careless in their mad pursuit of power and glory.

==Progression==
* [[Silence the Call]] / [[Disrupt the Rituals]]
* [[Through the Nether]]
* [[The Nether Approaches]] / [[The Void March]]
* [[The Shadow of the Void]]
