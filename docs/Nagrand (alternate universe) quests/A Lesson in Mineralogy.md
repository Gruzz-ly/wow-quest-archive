==Objectives==
Collect 4 Earthen Cores.
* [[Earthen Core]] (4)

==Description==
<Gazmolf gestures at the large machine nearby.>

I built this machine to break down elementium minerals into base elements. You see, it's not just what's buried within the ground that can be valuable; but also the ground itself!

Take, for example, the [[earth elemental]]s below us; inside every earth elemental is an earthen core, dense in precious metal!.

Those elementals are going to make us rich! Collect several earthen cores, place them in the Gold-O-Matic 9000, and I'll give you a cut!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Steamwheedle Preservation Society]]

==Progress==
<The Gold-O-Matic 9000 buzzes and whirrs with the sounds of heavy machinery.>

==Completion==
<The Gold-O-Matic 9000 crunches and grinds through the elemental remains.>
