==Description==
In {{Au|Nagrand}}, the ogres tell of an ancient weapon called Gutrek's cleaver. I would very much like to study it. A [[goblin]] treasure hunter by the name of Val Goldspade discovered the whereabouts of the weapon. Unfortunately, this goblin has gone missing somewhere in the Broken Precipice - probably after a run-in with the locals.
