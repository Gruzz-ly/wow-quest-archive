==Objectives==
Collect 15 Nagrand Cherries.
*[[Nagrand Cherry (quest item)]] (15)

==Description==
Oh no! They must be vegetarians.

What these [[elekk]] need is fruit and lots of it. There are cherries all over the place around here under the trees.

You wouldn't mind grabbing me some, would ya?

==Rewards==
You receive: 
*14,930 [[XP]]
*{{cost|15||}}

==Progress==
I heard the worst rumor about how you have to obtain those things.

Something about [[talbuk]] first eating them and then 'processing' them, and then... well, I don't want to talk about it.

==Completion==
You got them all? I just know this is going to work.

==Trivia==
*The rumor Digrem mentions is a reference to [[A Rare Bean]].
