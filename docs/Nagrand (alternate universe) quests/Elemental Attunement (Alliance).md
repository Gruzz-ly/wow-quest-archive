==Objectives==
Attune to the four elemental pillars.
*[[Pillar of the Earth (object)|Attune to the Earth]]
*[[Pillar of the Wind|Attune to the Wind]]
*[[Pillar of the Flame|Attune to the Flame]]
*[[Pillar of the Water|Attune to the Water]]

==Description==
Even now, as we speak, the voice of {{Au|Kalandrios}} continues to whisper to my mind.

"The Hero of [[Azeroth]] must attune to the elements of the plateau."

Upon the {{Au|Elemental Plateau}} are four great pillars carved of living rock. Lay your hands upon the stone pillars and your soul will be attuned with the elements.

I will continue to commune with the great [[furies]] and attempt to further understand their will while you journey to the plateau.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I see a fire within your eyes and a wind upon your step, <name>.

If what Kalandrios speaks is true, you have attuned your life energy with each of the elemental forces on {{Au|Draenor}}.

The voice says that you are now ready to undertake the Ritual of Binding.

Return to me when your work upon the plateau is finished and we will speak further.
