==Objectives==
Kill 15 Burning Blade forces at [[Hallvalor]].
*{{Au|Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade}} forces at Hallvalor slain (15)

==Description==
Hallvalor is the ancestral home of my clan, the Burning Blade. When the new warlord and his family came to power, I was exiled for being a [[half-breed]].

I want justice.

I suspect you won't mind killing along the way. Not that you'll have any choice.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A great victory over the Burning Blade!

This [[Flamebender Ka'graz]] sounds formidable. We shall have to keep an eye on her and her [[blademaster]]s.

==Notes==
Targets include [[Blademaster Trainee]]s, [[Burning Flameseer]]s and [[Hallvalor Villager]]s.

==Patch changes==
