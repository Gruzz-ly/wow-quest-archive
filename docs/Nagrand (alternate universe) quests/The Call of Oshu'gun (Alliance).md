==Description==
The elements have spoken and a vision has been revealed, <name>.

Together we shall travel to the great mountain Oshu'gun and put an end to the dark disturbance there.

If what you saw in the vision is to be believed, then great danger awaits us.

I will meet you in the Spirit Woods at the foot of Oshu'gun. When you are ready to depart, speak with Gixmo Moneycash and he will fly you to there.

These woods are sacred to the orcs and to my people as well.

Beneath the great mountain of Oshu'gun lies the heart of Nagrand, the Genedar. This great dimensional vessel rescued my people from annihilation and brought us to this world.
