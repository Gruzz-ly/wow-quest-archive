==Objectives==
Use Thaelin's Copter to get up to the [[Rangari Overlook]].
*[[Thaelin's Copter]] used

==Description==
There weren't many survivors of the {{Au|Warsong clan|Warsong}} attack. The few remaining {{Au|rangari}} have gone up to one of the bluffs overlooking [[Telaar]].

The rangari are waiting for you. They're planning a surprise counter-attack.

My copter's taken a beating. The auto-pilot's set to take you up there. I think she's got one last trip in her.

Maybe.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We've been expecting you, commander.

The situation is grim, but doable with your help.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
