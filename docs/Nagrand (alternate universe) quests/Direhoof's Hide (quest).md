==Progress==
Most talbuk are peaceful creatures that will only attack when they are defending their herd. Not Direhoof though, that talbuk is one of the most aggresively dangerous beasts I've ever encountered... and one of the most magnificent talbuk I've ever seen!

If you encounter Direhoof while adventuring and live to tell the tale, return to me with the beast's hide and I'll see that you're rewarded!

==Completion==
I'm not going to lie to you, <name>... I'll be sleeping more soundly at night knowing that Direhoof isn't out there somewhere roaming the wild.

I'll also be sleeping more soundly on the pile of money I'm going to make selling this hide to some rich collector!

Cha-ching!
