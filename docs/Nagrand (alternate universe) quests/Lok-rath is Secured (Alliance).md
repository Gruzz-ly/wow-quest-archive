==Objectives==
Speak with [[Rangari D'kaan]] at [[Telaari Station]].

==Description==
With their leader dead, the remaining Warsong will be easier to finish.

As soon as that's done, I'll pull our soldiers out of Lok-rath and head for Grommashar.

If you're heading back to Telaari Station, would you please inform D'kaan?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,510 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Completion==
If you hadn't gone to Lok-rath, our forces would have been decimated.

I'm sorry to hear they laid a trap for you. I guess you have a reputation now.
