==Objectives==
Defeat the Gorian Beast-Lasher while riding your Boar-In-Training.

==Description==
Nagrand is home to the mightiest beasts in Draenor, and the ogres of the region have learned to tame them using brutal techniques.

There is one ogre in particular, the Gorian Beast-Lasher, that smells of blood and fear. Go on and see how your boar reacts to that.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (20)

==Completion==
Those poor beasts! I'm glad you two put that ogre out of commission. Check back in tomorrow and we can continue the training.
