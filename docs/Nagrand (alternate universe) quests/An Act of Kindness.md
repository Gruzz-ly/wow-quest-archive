==Objectives==
Use Restorative Goldcaps to revive fallen [[rangari]].
*[[Restorative Goldcap]]
*[[Rangari Patroller]]s saved

==Description==
I know that you and Vindicator [[Yrel]] are here on important matters, but I must ask you a favor.

A squad of rangari left on patrol just before the poisonous mist set in.

If they were caught out in the swamp, they are surely in trouble.

Harvest the Restorative Goldcaps growing among the reeds, and use them to restore any fallen rangari that you find.

If you find yourself in trouble, eat one to combat the poison.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*18,840 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

==Progress==
Were you able to find the others?

==Completion==
Thank the Light! All of the rangari who were missing have returned accounted for. Thank you, hero.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
