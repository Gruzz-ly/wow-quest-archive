==Rewards==
You will receive:
*7,540 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I have plenty of meat. You should buy some.

What I really need are bones. {{Au|Nagrand}}'s animals are the heartiest on all of {{Au|Draenor}}. They have the finest-quality bones.

I'm making the tastiest soup you've ever tried. I'll show that [["Chef" Grogglefitz|Grogglefitz]] who the best cook truly is.
*[[Hearty Soup Bone]] (20)

==Completion==
That's a good start. I'll throw these in the pot.

Bring me more.
