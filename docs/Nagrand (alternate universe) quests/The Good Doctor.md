==Objectives==
Rescue Dr. Hadley Ricard.
*Dr. Hadley Ricard rescued

==Description==
Our expedition biologist has been kidnapped by podlings!

We came to Nagrand to explore, to slay the mightiest of beasts, and test our mettle alongside the great Hemet Nesingwary.

As soon as we arrived, Hemet's hunting prowess was needed to combat the Warsong. Rather than sit around twiddling our thumbs, we decided to continue the expedition!

We were exploring Spiteleaf Thicket when podlings ambushed us! In the chaos, Dr. Hadley Ricard was taken captive.

Please, we can't just leave him there!

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Your timely arrival to rescue me from the podlings was most appreciated!

This research station has seen better days... my equipment and belongings were damaged in the ambush.

However, with your aid, I'm sure we'll be up and running again in no time!
