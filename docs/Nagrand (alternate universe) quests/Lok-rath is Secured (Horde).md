==Objectives==
Speak with [[Thrall]] at [[Wor'var]].

==Description==
With their leader dead, the remaining Warsong will be easy pickings.

As soon as that's done, I'll pull our soldiers out of Lok-rath and head for Grommashar.

If you're heading back to Wor'var, inform Thrall that we'll be ready soon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*6500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
On one side, our enemy, the Warsong. On the other, our more ancient foe, the ogres of Highmaul.

We must bring both to justice. We must rid Nagrand of their very presence.

==Completion==
If you hadn't gone to Lok-rath, our forces would have been decimated.

I'm sorry to hear they laid a trap you. You have a reputation now.

==Notes==

Thrall's gossip in Wor'var:
{{Dialogue|
Throm-Ka, commander.

I'm glad you're here. I need you to take over our preparations to deal with the {{Au|Warsong clan}}.

We will drive them before us, and we'll bring Garrosh to justice once and for all.
