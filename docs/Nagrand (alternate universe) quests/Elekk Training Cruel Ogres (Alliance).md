==Objectives==
Defeat the Gorian Beast-Lasher while riding your Meadowstomper-In-Training. 
*[[Gorian Beast-Lasher]] Killed
*[[Meadowstomper-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
This beast is surely at home in Nagrand, and I bet ye after all of the years of domestication by Draenei, it's going to be a snap to train.

Let's set it loose against the ogres of the region that yer familiar with. That Gorian Beast-Lasher, the one that smells of blood and fear, go on and see how your elekk reacts to that.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (20)

==Completion==
Those poor beasts! I'm glad you two put that ogre out of commission. Check back in tomorrow and we can continue the training.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
