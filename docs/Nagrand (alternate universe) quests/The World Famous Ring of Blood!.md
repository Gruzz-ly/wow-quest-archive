== Description ==
Dear Unadulterated Badass,

If you're reading this, you're exactly the sort of tough-as-nails champ in the making we need down at the Ring of Blood in Nagrand.

You and two friends are cordially invited to fight for your lives against the toughest creatures this side of [[Gorgrond]].  It's positively brutal - and the crowd loves it!

Come talk to me to start your first fight - beat four of the fiercest creatures I've got and you'll get a shot at the champ himself!

Two hundred gold... two hundred and fifty...

That makes it about three fifty.  Not bad!

Oh, hey, what's shakin' champ?

== Completion ==
You did it.  You really did it!  Here's your winnings, champ.

Man, the Highmaul ogres are [[Ogre Invasion!|not going to like this...]]

* 15,070 [[XP]]
* [[Mogor's Cache]] spawns

== Notes ==
The first four challenges can be done in any order, but they must all be defeated to challenge Mogor.

{{gossip|''I'd like to fight <mob>.''}}

[[Ring of Blood Invitation]]s are looted from [[Bloody Stack of Invitations]], which in turn has a chance to drop from the mob involved in that days' garrison Bounty quest.  Your garrison must be level 3 for the quest giver, {{npc|Alliance|Renzik "The Shiv"}}/{{npc|Horde|Shadow Hunter Ty'jin}}, to spawn. If they do not spawn for you that day, you can search custom premade groups in the [[Group Finder]] for someone that they did spawn for.

Since you must be on the quest to get the rewards, the general ideal is that the group member who gets the stack from the Bounty mob then loots it and passes out the other two invitations. This is not actually required though; no one can force the player to pass them out, and the invitations can be sold on the [[Auction House]]. Not everyone will know what the stack is for though, so it would be worth while to quickly discuss it with them.
