==Progress==
Not far from here is a hippo of unusual size and ferocity known as Mu'gra. I've been contacted by a private collector that would like to acquire Mu'gra's teeth for a special exhibit.

Hippo teeth are extremely difficult to extract, and we can't be selling damaged goods so just bring back the entire head, got it?

Good luck!

==Completion==
Wow! Look at the size of that thing... that's got to be the biggest hippo I've ever seen!

Mu'gra was one of the angriest hippos I've ever seen, but she's all smiles now!

Get it? Hippo teeth... smiles... eh, eh?
