==Objectives==
Speak with Vindicator Yrel at the Gates of Grommashar and lead the assault on the Warsong.
* Speak with Vindicator Yrel at the Gates of Grommashar
* Garrosh Hellscream dealt with

==Description==
The time has come, commander. You've dealt with all of the Warsong's allies and holdings.

Our troops are massing at the gates of Grommashar. The rangari have reliable intel that Garrosh is holed up inside the Warsong fortress.

All of our efforts have led to this moment. Let's take out Garrosh.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive one of these rewards:
|Grounded Headguard|c1={{ClassIcon|Warrior}}{{ClassIcon|Paladin}}{{ClassIcon|Death Knight}}
|Thundercaller's Cowl|c2={{ClassIcon|Priest}}{{ClassIcon|Mage}}{{ClassIcon|Warlock}}
|Coif of Grasping Earth|c3={{ClassIcon|Hunter}}{{ClassIcon|Shaman}}
|Thunderbolt Tanned Helmet|c4={{ClassIcon|Druid}}{{ClassIcon|Rogue}}{{ClassIcon|Monk}}}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|61|60}}
*30,140 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with the {{Au|Council of Exarchs}}

== Completion ==
It's over. The Warsong are broken. Garrosh Hellscream is finally dead.

Somehow, I sense it's only a matter of time before Grommash seeks vengeance.

==Notes==
Head to the [[Gates of Grommashar]]. It is there you meet [[Yrel]]. She is accompanied by [[Rangari D'kaan]] along with the [[Telaari Siege Engine]]s, [[Alliance Soldier]]s, [[Citadel Mage]]s, and [[Rangari Sharpshooter]]s. Speak to Yrel:

{{dialogue|We march on your order, commander. Garrosh and his forces await.

{{gossip|Yrel, let's blow open those gates and take Grommashar.}}
}}

:{{text|say|Vindicator Yrel|D'kaan, let's get in there.}}
:{{text|say|Rangari D'kaan|Siege Engines, fire.}}
:''The Telaari Siege Engines begin to take out the gates.''
:{{text|say|Vindicator Yrel|Alliance, advance!}}
:''The Alliance Soldiers begin charging into [[Grommashar]].''
:{{text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|Warsong, bring me their heads!}}

Head into Grommashar where the Horde Soldiers are fighting against the [[Nagrand Skirmisher]]s & [[Warsong Raider]]s. Meet up with D'kaan at the second gate.

{{dialogue|Yrel and I will lead the bulk of our forces south beyond this barrier.

Meanwhile, if I may suggest, you lead the rest of the soldiers west and create a flanking diversion.

{{gossip|I agree. A flanking maneuver will buy you the time you need to move most of our forces closer to Garrosh.}}
}}

:{{text|yell|Vindicator Yrel|We'll protect you while you flank them to the west.}}

Head to the Warsong Raiders where their [[Packmaster Grokglok]] is waiting.
:{{text|yell|Alliance Soldier|Watch out. Wolfriders!}}
:{{text|yell|Packmaster Grokglok|Warsong, run them down!}}
:{{text|yell|Packmaster Grokglok|Finish these weaklings.}}
:{{text|say|Packmaster Grokglok|Fetch, girl.}}

Slay [[Packmaster Grokglok]]:
:{{text|say|Packmaster Grokglok|No... this can't be.}}
:{{text|yell|Rangari Sharpshooter|We need to move up.}}

Head to the wolves' den:
:{{text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|Leap from your caves, my wolves.}}

Upon proceeding and dealing with the Raiders, the Citadel Mages begin burning the den.
:{{text|yell|Citadel Mage|Seal those wolf dens!}}

Meet up with Yrel again and speak to her.
{{dialogue|D'kaan just finished scouting up ahead. I don't think you're going to like this.

{{gossip|Like it or not, we need to move ahead. What's the situation?}}
}}

:{{text|say|Rangari D'kaan|Bad news, commander. They've enslaved Durn the Hungerer.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Yrel|We have to go through the beast to get to Garrosh.}}

Head to the arena where {{au|Durn the Hungerer}} is chained.
:{{text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|Loose the Hungerer.}}

While battling Durn:
:{{text|yell|Rangari D'kaan|Rangari, fire!}}

Yrel unleashes her Holy Light:
:{{text|yell|Vindicator Yrel|Get into the Holy Light.}}

Head to the final gate and speak to Yrel:

{{dialogue|Garrosh sits on his throne behind these gates. This is the moment it's all been building toward, <name>.

On your order, you and I will confront him once and for all.

{{Gossip|Give the order, Yrel. Destroy the gates and get us in there.}}
}}

:{{text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|Come, draenei witch. I'm waiting.}}
:''Yrel turn towards D'kaan.''
:{{text|say|Vindicator Yrel|D'kaan, I need you and our forces to stay here.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Yrel|Buy us the time we need to deal with Garrosh.}}
:{{text|say|Rangari D'kaan|Whatever happens, [[Maraad]] would be proud of you.}}
:{{text|yell|Rangari D'kaan|Blow open these gates!}}
:''The Telaari Siege engines blew the final gates.''

Follow Yrel to Garrosh Hellscream where is resides on the throne.
:{{text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|You're a fool to come here.}}
:{{text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|You think after everything, you can kill me?}}
:{{text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|Justice. You don't know the meaning of the word.}}

Aggro Garrosh and begin confronting him.

;Sunder
:{{text|yell|Garrosh Hellscream|Taste Gorehowl's steel.}}

;Iron Barrage
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|I am your death.}}

Upon depleting his health to 58%.
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|I cannot be defeated.}}

Upon depleting Garrosh's HP to 50%, Garrosh stuns the adventurer and Yrel and starts punching:
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Now, you die.}}
:''Thrall appears.''
:{{text|say|Thrall|Garrosh!}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Thrall? You're too late, old friend.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|No. No more, Garrosh. Just you and me.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I challenge you to Mak'gora.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Yrel|Thrall, no.}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|Very well, shaman. We finish this alone, where it all began...}}
:{{text|say|Garrosh Hellscream|... at the Stones of Prophecy.}}

''After that, the cutscene begins.''

===Cutscene===
[[File:Garrosh finale.jpg|thumb|500px|The Legacy of Garrosh Hellscream.]]
<poem>
''Garrosh and Thrall approach the site of the mak'gora, the Stones of Prophecy -- future site of [[Garadar]], as well as the same place they first met.''
'''Thrall''': {{text|bossemote|You must answer for your crimes, Garrosh.}}
''Garrosh and Thrall glare at each other, before Garrosh roars angrily at Thrall as he charges at him. The two exchange blows and argue during their fight.''
'''Garrosh Hellscream''': {{text|bossemote|All I did, I did... FOR THE HORDE!}}
'''Thrall''': {{text|bossemote|You've failed the Horde!}}
''Garrosh throws Gorehowl at Thrall, which he deflects, then leaps on him, landing a punch, and grabbing him by his prayer beads.''
'''Garrosh Hellscream''': {{text|bossemote|You made me warchief...}}
''Garrosh lands a punch on Thrall, breaking his prayer beads and knocking away the Doomhammer.''
'''Garrosh Hellscream''': {{text|bossemote|...you left me to pick up your pieces...}}
''Garrosh continues to beat Thrall, while his voice trembles as he speaks, then grabs him and throws him down.''
'''Garrosh Hellscream''': {{text|bossemote|...YOU FAILED... ME!}}
''Thrall partially gets up and glares at Garrosh angrily.''
'''Garrosh Hellscream''': {{text|bossemote|You never had the strength of a true warrior.}}
'''Thrall''': {{text|bossemote|I do not rely on strength alone, Garrosh. My power is all around you.}}
''Thrall gets up and hits Garrosh with a fireball, launching him into the air, manipulates the air to bring Garrosh down, and finally incapacitates him with a fist made of earth.''
'''Garrosh Hellscream''': {{text|bossemote|THRALL!}}
'''Garrosh Hellscream''': {{text|bossemote|YOU made me what I am!}}
'''Thrall''': {{text|bossemote|No... You chose your own destiny.}}
''Thrall casts down a single bolt of lightning that electrocutes Garrosh, ending his life. Thrall then stares off into the distance, picks up the Doomhammer, and walks away.''
</poem>

On the other side of the cutscene, the adventurer, D'kaan, Thrall, and Yrel are back with [[Khadgar]], {{au|Durotan}}, [[Aggralan|Aggra]], [[Cordana Felsong]], and {{au|Draka}}. They have gossip:

{{Dialogue|title=Draka|
We Frostwolves have always walked alone, with only our wolves at our side. But, our clan is a part of this world, and It's clear that we have a role to play in protecting it.

This 'Garrosh' was a dangerous one. Still, he showed us something valuable. I see now that, united, the orcs can be great. It is more important than ever to have a righteous voice to guide them.

The Frostwolves must be that voice.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Yrel|
The Archmage tells me that Garrosh set all of these events in motion. He was a criminal from your world, yes? I have never seen the orcish idea of 'justice' before.

I wish I could say it's over, but this war is only beginning. Grommash's Iron Horde continues to grow stronger. My people will never be safe so long as his foundries continue churning out their terrible weapons. We draenei were not ready for this fight, but we must be prepared to finish it.

There are shadows before us - but only because the light is at our back.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Durotan|
Garrosh came out of nowhere, and manipulated the clans as you would play a drum. It is good that he is finished.

But, the damage is already done. It's like I don't recognize my own people anymore. Grommash Hellscream has turned family and friends alike against one another, and It has to stop. We must dismantle his war machine: First by taking out his ogre allies, then by demolishing the Blackrock Foundry.

After that, we will bring Hellscream himself to justice. Just as we've seen today.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Cordana|
The archmage is gearing up for another campaign. All he can talk about is finding Gul'dan.

But, I worry... Gul'dan has already tried to kill Khadgar once. The Archmage is going to need all the help he can get.

<Cordana looks at you, pointedly.>}}

{{Dialogue|title=Khadgar|
We've closed this chapter. But Garrosh only set these events in motion... We'll have to close all the loops if we want to keep Azeroth safe. That means finding and neutralizing Gul'dan.

<Khadgar breathes a heavy sigh.>

Still, a little celebration may be in order before we get back to business. I've got a bottle of aged Dalaran red saved up for just such an occasion, if you'd care to meet me in my tower later.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Thrall|
<Thrall is deep in thought and doesn't appear to want to speak at the moment.>}}

;Upon completion
:{{text|say|Durotan|The Iron Horde remains a threat. We should hit them where it hurts, and take out the Blackrock Foundry.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Yrel|Perhaps we should deprive them of their allies. The ogres here in Nagrand are vulnerable now.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Good plan. Now, lets get moving.}}
