==Objectives==
Speak with the spirits at the {{Au|Ancestral Grounds}}.

==Description==
The spirits of the dead have long been drawn to {{Au|Oshu'gun}}.

As long as I can remember, the woods have been filled with ancestral spirits making a ghostly pilgrimage to the heart of the mountain.

However, I fear that what is transpiring here is not the normal spirit walk I have seen before.

Make your way to the Ancestral Grounds and commune with the spirits there for guidance on this matter.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|15||}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The situation here is dire, <name>, but I sensed that we would meet again.

I do not hear the call of the void as loudly as the others, for I am not long dead and my body rests far from this place.

With time though, that will change.

If you are here to help, listen closely for time is short.
