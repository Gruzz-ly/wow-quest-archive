==Objectives==
Coax 5 Tenderhoof Meadowstompers.
*[[Tenderhoof Meadowstomper]]s coaxed (5)

==Description==
That's better, but there's still something wrong. I'm getting desperate here, <name>.

Can I call ya, <name>? Great.

Look, I think I have it now. I know what's wrong.

They miss their babies.

Yeah! When they first came here, the, uh... the bastard hunters that... abandoned them said they left the babies behind.

If we're going to save them from a life of misery, if we're going to save those babies, <under his breath> and turn a tidy profit, we've got to get them some new babies!

==Rewards==
*[[Meadowstomper Calf]]
You will also receive:
*{{cost|30||}}
*18,660 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You did it, <name>! Mama, papa, and family. It brings a tear to my eye.

Here, take this runty one. Now that I have the whole herd, this one's just an extra mouth to feed and won't fetch anything at market.
