==Objectives==
Locate [[Rangari Eleena]] at [[Mar'gok's Overwatch]].

==Description==
Ya know, we sent a couple o' scouts ta check out those big, smelly, 'civilized' [[ogre]]s at Mar'gok's Overwatch.

Haven't heard from 'em in a bit. Matter o' fact, not since I saved yer bacon up at {{Au|Telaar}}.

Have some time ta ride over there and check up on 'em, <boyo/girly>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,490 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm afraid we have some trouble.

==Patch changes==
