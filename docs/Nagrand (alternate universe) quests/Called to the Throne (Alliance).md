==Objectives==
Commune with the [[furies]] at the {{Au|Throne of the Elements|Throne of Elements}}.
*Speak with [[Vindicator Nobundo]]
*Commune with the furies

==Description==
I was far from here in [[Talador]] when the voice called out to me.

I looked around but found myself alone. Again, I heard the voice as if it were a breeze in my mind.

"You are needed at the throne," it whispered.

The voice called itself {{Au|Kalandrios}}, and it guided me to this place.

I had never been here before, nor had I yet beheld these furies with my eyes; yet this feels strangely familiar to me as if it happened long ago in a forgotten dream.

We should greet the furies and hear them out.

==Rewards==
You will receive: 
*{{cost|1|46|}}
*1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am not sure what to make of this.

The elements are no longer in balance? The great fury Gordawg is missing and must be found?

The furies appear noble, and deep within my soul their words ring true.

I believe we aid should them in their cause.

==Notes==

:{{text|say|Vindicator Nobundo|When you are ready, we will commune with the great furies.}}

Speak to Vindicator Nobundo:
{{dialogue|This is the Throne of Elements.

You stand in the presence of furies, <name>. Here, the earth lives beneath your feet and the wind watches your every move.

This is truly hallowed ground.
