==Objectives==
Rescue 6 Goblin Traders.
*[[Goblin Trader]]s Saved (6)
*[[Sabermaw Cage]] (6)

==Description==
We never even saw the ambush coming...

The [[saberon]] hit us so hard and fast we barely had time to think.

Those overgrown mongrels dragged the others away and left me here for dead...they probably thought I was too close to dying.

I hear they like their meat fresh...
<cough>....well I ain't going down that easy!

Don't worry about me...<cough>...I've been through worse! You're gonna have to go to [[Sabermaw]] and get the other merchants out though.

They've probably got 'em all caged up in there...

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sabermaw Scarfang's Choker
|Sabermaw Mauler's Gorget
|Sabermaw Mystic's Pendant
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Steamwheedle Preservation Society]]

==Completion==
You got all of the captured traders out of Sabermaw? Fantastic!

Now they owe me and I ain't one to let a debt go uncollected! As for you, take this reward for your trouble!
