==Objectives==
Kill 15 ogres at [[Mar'gok's Overwatch]].
*Ogres at Mar'gok's Overwatch slain (15)

==Description==
With actual ogre mages present, the [[Highmaul]] have been increasing patrols and aggression.

Thinning their ranks will go a long way to deterring the Highmaul from making a comeback in {{Au|Nagrand}}.

Head up to my sister [[Rangari Mirana|Mirana]] afterwards, she should have more news.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Plainsthunder Warboots|Windshaper Treads|Stormsteppe Sabatons|Beastrider Boots}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|15||}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Perfect, they will have to concentrate more on base defense now.  Hopefully things will get back to normal out there.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
