==Objectives==
Collect the Horn of Banthar from {{Au|Banthar}}.
*[[Horn of Banthar]]

==Description==
[[Rangari Laara|Laara]] told me that they have Banthar here! Or rather, that she's still alive back now. Did what I just said make any sense?

This is our chance, commander. We can defeat a younger, more powerful version of [[Banthar]] and really stick it to these {{Au|rangari}}.

We'll show Laara how a true professional works.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|30|80|}}
*18,840 [[XP]]
*[[Garrison Resources]] (50)

==Progress==
Banthar's horn. [[Hemet Nesingwary|Hemet]] would be green with envy to have another shot at such a powerful beast.

==Completion==
Magnificent kill, commander. You've done us all proud.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 6.0.2|note=Added.}}
