==Objectives==
Use a [[Nether Beacon|Void Beacon]] to travel to the [[Twisting Nether]].
*Travel Into the Twisting Nether

==Description==
The rituals have been disrupted, yet the nether beacons still glow with power....

This can only mean that the beacons are powered from within the Twisting Nether itself!

The connection to the void must be severed! There is but one way to accomplish this; you must slay the void creature that maintains the connection with our world.

Lay your hands upon a beacon and travel into the Twisting Nether. When you have arrived on the other side, locate a Shamanstone and use it to contact me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The veil between dimensions is thin. Do you hear my words through the shaman stone?

==Completion==
The Shamanstone appears to be working, even from within the Twisting Nether.

There is much that needs to be done, <name>. The monsters of the void are gathering upon Oshu'gun and must be stopped, else they invade our realm.

==Progression==
* [[Silence the Call]] / [[Disrupt the Rituals]]
* [[Through the Nether]]
* [[The Nether Approaches]] / [[The Void March]]
* [[The Shadow of the Void]]
