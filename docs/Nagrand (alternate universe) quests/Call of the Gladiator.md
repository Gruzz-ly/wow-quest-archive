==Objectives==
Take the Sigil of Highmaul to [[Kharg]] outside the [[Highmaul Coliseum]] in {{Au|Nagrand}}.
*[[Sigil of Highmaul]] (provided)

==Description==
Your merciless rampage has not gone unnoticed, [[gladiator]]. So many of your enemies have fallen before your might. It is because of your unrelenting savagery that {{Au|Imperator Mar'gok}} himself has requested your presence at the grand Highmaul Coliseum. It is at [[Highmaul]] that a battle of epic proportions awaits.

Should you heed the call of the gladiator, present this sigil to my brother, Kharg. He is the arena master residing outside of the Coliseum in Nagrand.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|32|}}
*7,540 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A bold decision, gladiator. For most, death is the only thing they find at the Coliseum. Surviving here is more than a test of skill, it is a test of wills. Do you have the fortitude to become a champion?
