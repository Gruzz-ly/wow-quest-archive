==Objectives==
Defeat Maimclaw while riding your Talbuk-In-Training. 
*[[Maimclaw]] Killed
*[[Silverpelt-In-Training Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
I've got one last challenge for ye, commander, but if it isn't a doozy.

They call them the garn. Wolves as black as night, and twice the size of a normal wolf, they can tear a man apart in seconds. Any beast in their right mind would be scared witless at the sight of such a predator.

There's a lone garn that's made it from their usual home in Frostfire, all the way over to Nagrand. Take your talbuk, mount up, and bring it down. If the two of you survive, your talbuk will truly be ready for war.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (50)
*[[Trained Silverpelt]]

==Completion==
Your talbuk has grown from a wee silverpelt into a fine specimen of war beast, and it's all due to your diligence.

I'm happy to hand over the reins of this fully-trained mount to you, commander. Ride it with pride!
