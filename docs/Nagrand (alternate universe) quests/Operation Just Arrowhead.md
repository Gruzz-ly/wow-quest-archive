==Objectives==
Kill 15 Warsong forces at Telaar.
*[[Warsong Raider]]
*[[Invading Warsinger]]
*[[Savage Warwolf]]

==Description==
It goes without saying that the Warsong in Telaar need to be dealt with. Rangari Ogir and his forces on the overlook will help you kill any of the orcs that are out in the open.

You just start the fight, and they'll end it with extreme prejudice.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That bit of justice is sure to have lifted the spirits of my rangari.

Losing Telaar and many of our friends has taken a heavy toll.

Thank you, commander.
