==Objectives==
Defeat Crushmaul in the {{Au|Ring of Trials}}.
*Speak with [[Guzrug the Tiny|Guzrug]] to begin the fight
*[[Crushmaul]] slain

==Description==
So you want to fight in the Ring of Trials do you? It's your funeral, bub!

Your first fight is against an exceptionally large and angry [[ogre]] named Crushmaul. That's not all though, you'll have to take out his armored [[boar]] companion too; Crushmaul never goes into the ring without him!

I hope your affairs are in order, because the last gladiator that fought Crushmaul went home in a body bag...

I'm counting on you! Get your ass inside the arena and speak with my associate Guzrug to start the fight!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|29|20|}}
*18,500 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with Steamwheedle Draenor Expedition

==Progress==
What are you waiting for? Get in the ring and start spilling blood!

==Completion==
Whoa! I couldn't tell if that was [[Porkchop]] squealing in there or if you had Crushmaul crying like a little baby!

You've got talent, kid!

Here's your cut of the profit, but why stop there? Together we can make a mountain of gold!
