==Objectives==
Kill Greyseer and 6 Pale orcs.
*[[Greyseer]] slain
*Pale orcs slain  (6) 

==Description==
If we are to succeed in stopping {{Au|Cho'gall}} from destroying the [[naaru]], we will need to fight our way through the {{Au|Underpale}}; a dark, winding cavern infested with the Pale.

The [[Pale]] are fallen orcs that despise all that is good and holy. The longer they are left to their devices beneath the ground, the further their dark plots progress.

Make your way into the Underpale, slay the vile creatures within and take out their leader, Greyseer.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15||}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The Pale are wretched creatures that hate the Light and plot against the innocent. Without Greyseer to lead them, they will be disorganized and in chaos for a time.

Should a new leader arise from within their ranks, we shall smite them down once more. 

==Progression==
{{The Dark Heart of Oshu'gun}}

==Patch changes==
