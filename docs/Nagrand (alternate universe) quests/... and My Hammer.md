==Objectives==
Retrieve Mo'mor's Holy Hammer.
*[[Mo'mor's Holy Hammer]]

==Description==
When they captured me, the Warsong took my hammer. Will you help me to recover it?

I ask only because it's a holy relic. It should be taken from these orc dogs for no other reason than to return it to Auchindoun.

Perhaps then, a worthy vindicator of the Light will take it up to smite the enemies of the draenei.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm having trouble seeing. I may not have long.

==Completion==
Thank you for this kindness, <name>. Perhaps I can still salvage some scrap of honor.
