==Objectives==
Collect Crulgorosh's Orders and Thulgork's Orders at [[Mar'gok's Overwatch]].
*[[Crulgorosh's Orders]]
*[[Thulgork's Orders]]

==Description==
My sister, [[Rangari Mirana|Mirana]], is scouting the upper bluff while I've checked out the lower area. There are two particular [[ogre]] mages that do a lot of bossing around in the lower area.

They seem to have some orders or scrolls on them that would help us figure out what's really going on.

Collect that information and meet with my sister on the long stairway up there.

==Rewards==
You will also receive:
*{{cost|15||}}
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Those orders would be really useful in piecing this whole thing together.

==Completion==
Glad you are here. I almost got killed up there at the top. Oh what are these papers? This is much worse than I imagined!

==Patch changes==
