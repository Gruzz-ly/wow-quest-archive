==Objectives==
Speak with {{Au|Kalandrios}} to begin the Ritual of Binding.
*Speak with Kalandrios

==Description==
It is time for you to undergo the Ritual of Binding, <name>. I will wait here as you speak with Kalandrios to begin the rite.

During the ritual, you will experience the vision of the elements. Return to me when the ritual is complete, and we will speak more.

|Windshaper Robe|c4={{ClassIcon|Priest}}{{ClassIcon|Mage}}{{ClassIcon|Warlock}}}}
'''You will also receive:'''
*{{Cost|14|60}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The wind is the voice of the elements, it whispers gently upon the breeze and howls fiercely within the storm.

{{gossip|I am ready to begin the Ritual of Binding.}}

==Cutscene==
''From a view across the trees, your vision lowers into a cave, flying through it. Then the scene switches to {{Au|Cho'gall}} transforming {{Au|K'ure}} into a [[void god]]. {{Au|Gul'dan}} appears.''
[[File:Cho'gall betraying Gul'dan.png|thumb|300px|Cho'gall betrays Gul'dan]]
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|Cho'gall! I sent you here to enslave this thing.}}
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|Where is my power, ogre?}}
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|Your power? (It's MY power!)}}
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|You will obey, disciple. Hand over its reins.}}
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|I think not. (We're done taking orders from you!)}}
:''Cho'gall throws Gul'dan through the room. Gul'dan then casts a projectile spell, which gets deflected by Cho'gall's magic shield.''
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|We've learned much from K'ure. (We're writing a book.)}}
:{{text|say|Gul'dan|You're insane.}}
:{{text|say|Cho'gall|Run away, old man. (Soon Highmaul will burn. Then, the world!)}}
:''Gul'dan vanishes.''

==Completion==
<Vindicator Nobundo listens closely as you speak of your vision.>

These are grave images of which you speak, <name>! If {{Au|Cho'gall}} continues bleeding the naaru of its Light, {{Au|K'ure}} will die and in the naaru's place a [[void god]] will emerge. Void gods are terrible creatures that live only to destroy!

We must travel to {{Au|Oshu'gun}} immediately and put a stop to the threat of Cho'gall!
