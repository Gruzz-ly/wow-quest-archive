==Objectives==
Enter the Sanctum of the Naaru.
* Enter the [[Sanctum of the Naaru]].
* [[Decimatus]] slain

==Description==
Amongst the timeworn wreckage of the [[Oshu'gun (alternate universe)|Genedar]] is the entrance to the vessel's inner chamber. The [[void]] energy appears to be most concentrated in that place.

You must enter the inner chamber and face whatever evil lurks within. I fear whatever fate may have befallen the great naaru {{Au|K'ure}} in that place, but regardless the evil there must be purged.

May the [[Light]] be with you, <name>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Shortsword
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Mace
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Mallet
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Greatmaul
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Crossbow
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Dagger
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Staff
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Spellstaff
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15}}
*14,930 [[XP]]
*[[Hanging Draenethyst Light]]

==Completion==
The fate of K'ure could not have been prevented.

{{Au|Cho'gall}} accelerated the [[naaru]]'s transition into a [[void god]] in hopes of bringing destruction upon {{Au|Draenor}}. Cho'gall must be dealt with, but for now let us honor the memory of the great naaru K'ure.

K'ure was truly the savior of my people, a friend to the virtuous, and a teacher of [[prophet]]s.

May the great naaru ever live within our hearts. 

==Notes==
After starting the quest:
:{{text|say|Vindicator Nobundo|Go! I will defend you from any Pale that would interfere...}}
After entering the sanctum:
:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|Behold, a void god is born! (You fools are too late!)}}
:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|A pity that I cannot stay to watch you die. (We're going to Highmaul!)}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Nobundo|The naaru... this cannot be!}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Nobundo|K'ure is transforming into a void god... and we are all that stands between it and the destruction of this land!}}
:{{text|yell|Decimatus|At long last... my time has come! This world shall crumble beneath the power of the void!)}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Nobundo|I am with you, <name>! We shall face this evil together!}}
After defeating Decimatus:
:{{text|say|Vindicator Nobundo|My heart aches over the loss of K'ure... but there is little time to mourn. We must find a way out of this place. Follow me!}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Nobundo|Just as I thought! There is an opening not far ahead!}}
After handing in the quest:
:{{text|say|Vindicator Nobundo|K'ure will be deeply missed by my people, but the story of your courage in the face of evil will inspire them.}}
