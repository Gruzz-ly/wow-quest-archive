==Objectives==
Enter the Sanctum of the Naaru.
* Enter the [[Sanctum of the Naaru]].
* [[Decimatus]] slain

==Description==
We are not far from the inner chamber, <name>. The truth behind the evil here awaits us.

I can project my spirit into the chamber to guide you, but it will be up to you to defeat the evil that lays within.

May the wind of {{Au|Kalandrios}} guide your arm, the wisdom of {{Au|Aborius}} enlighten your faculties, and the flame of {{Au|Incineratus}} burn your enemies.

May the memory of {{Au|Gordawg}} be your shield.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Shortsword
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Mace
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Mallet
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Greatmaul
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Crossbow
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Dagger
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Staff
|Void-Warped Oshu'gun Spellstaff
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|15}}
* 14,930 [[XP]]
*[[Hanging Draenethyst Light]]

==Completion==
You have done well, <name>.

By defeating the [[void god]] Decimatus, the destruction of this great valley has been avoided. The threat of the [[pale]] has subsided for now as well.

The loss of Gordawg will be felt throughout {{Au|Nagrand}}, but someday a new [[Furies|earthen fury]] will take seat upon the [[Throne of the Elements (alternate universe)|Throne of Elements]] and balance will be restored. 

==Notes==
After starting the quest:
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Go! I will hold back any reinforcements that attempt to follow!}}
After entering the sanctum:
:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|Behold, a void god is born! (You fools are too late!)}}
:{{text|yell|Cho'gall|A pity that I cannot stay to watch you die. (We're going to Highmaul!)}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|By the elements... what has Cho'gall done?}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Hold fast, <name>! The naaru is transforming into a void god... we have no choice but to stand and fight!}}
:{{text|yell|Decimatus|At long last... my time has come! This world shall crumble beneath the power of the void!)}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|With me, <name>! We fight as wolves!}}
After defeating Decimatus:
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|The great furies must be informed of what has transpired here. Quickly, follow me!}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|I sense a cool draft on my skin and the smell of earth and leaves... there must be an opening to the outside!}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|The opening is just ahead!}}
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|I will wait for you at the Throne of Elements. Be safe.}}
After handing in the quest:
:{{text|say|Farseer Drek'Thar|Though much has been lost, I sense a great peace in the elements. I will remember your courage always, friend.}}
