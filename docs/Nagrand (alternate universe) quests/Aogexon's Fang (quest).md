==Progress==
Aogexon is one of the most feared beasts in Nagrand, and one of the largest and most dangerous forest stalkers ever seen!

I've already been approached by a number of a collectors interested in obtaining one of Aogexon's deadly fangs. If you are up for the challenge, Aogexon can sometimes be found lurking in the swamp not far from here.

Good luck!
