==Objectives==
Speak with [[Yrel|Vindicator Yrel]] at [[Yrel's Watch]].

==Description==
Vindicator Yrel has taken most of our forces north. She's establishing a forward base along the [[Skysong River]].

She'll want to know that we're almost ready to move against [[Grommashar]].

I'm sure she can also use your help dealing with the {{Au|Warsong clan|Warsong}} orcs at [[Lok-rath]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*14,930 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It's good to see you, commander. When I'd heard about your garrison caravan being destroyed....

Well, let's just say that I feared the worst.

What word from [[Telaari Station]]?

==Notes==
;Accept
:{{text|say|Rangari D'kaan|Once we've dealt with the ogres, the {{au|Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade}}, and the orcs at [[Lok-rath]], we'll be ready to move on [[Grommashar]].}}
