==Progress==
Xelganak is as deadly as they come, <name>! I don't recommend going after Xelganak unless you love money, adventure, and glory.

Xelganak's poison stinger would be an easy sell to the right collector, so if you're up for the challenge I'll make sure you get handsomely rewarded.

Just don't go getting your face melted off like Bozzil, ok?

==Completion==
Whoa! Careful where you point that stinger!

Extraordinary... I've never seen anything like this before. As an archaeologist of the highest caliber, it is an honor to artificially fossilize this item and sell it to the highest bidder.

Well done!
