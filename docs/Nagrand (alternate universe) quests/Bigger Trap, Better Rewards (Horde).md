==Objectives==
Use the Deadly Iron Trap to capture an Ironhide Bull, Direfang Alpha, or Wetland Trampler.
*Beast Trapped
*Place A Large Work Order
*[[Deadly Iron Trap]] (provided)

==Description==
Ah, commander, it is good to see you again. With the materials we have gathered here in Draenor, we have been able to construct a trap strong enough to immobilize even the mightiest beast.

These enormous creatures can be found on the western side of Nagrand, among the most fertile plains.

A word of warning: these beasts are great and powerful. You may want to bring some friends along.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|30|80}}
*[[Garrison Resources]] (100)

==Completion==
Blood and thunder, that must have been quite a battle!

The materials we obtain from beasts of this magnitude will last us for quite a while.

==Patch changes==
