==Objectives==
Gain access to [[Alodi]]'s personal bank vault in [[Dalaran]] and retrieve the [[Powerful Mana Gem|Mana Gems]].
* Go to the [[Bank of Dalaran]]
* Speak with the manager
* Enter Alodi's personal vault
* Find the Mana Gems (3)

==Description==
[[Arrexis]] had a cadre of apprentices and subordinates to help him with the ritual, something you are currently lacking.

In older times, when magic was less understood and spells required vast amounts of [[mana]] to cast, we stored mana in gems for use in complex spells.

Lucky for us, I still have a few powerful Mana Gems in my vault, along with some other useful items. You merely need to go to the Bank of Dalaran and gain access.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Progress==
You found everything in my vault? I hope the defenses weren't a bother.

==Completion==
Excellent! Honestly, I'm surprised you [[mage]]s no longer use Mana Gems. I found them terribly useful.

At any rate, these will make up for the lack of additional mages.

==Notes==
On accept, Alodi briefly casts some kind of spell on you.
:{{text|say|Alodi|Speak to the bank manager. The sigil I just gave you should grant access. There may still be wards guarding the vault, so be careful.}}

Use the nearby portal to teleport to [[Krasus' Landing]] and then head to the Bank of Dalaran, which is located west of [[Windrunner's Sanctuary]]. When you arrive, speak with the bank manager, [[Glutonia]].

:Our bank is so secure you'll have trouble getting your own things out! Ha ha!
::''{{gossip|I would like to access the personal vault of Alodi, [[Archmage]] of Dalaran.}}''
:{{text|say|Glutonia|Hmph! You don't look a thing like him! Fine, let's have a look...}}
:''Glutonia casts a spell similar to the one Alodi used on you earlier.''
:{{text|say|Glutonia|It seems you bear his sigil. How'd you manage that? Well, rules are rules.}}
:''Glutonia runs over to the northeastern corner of the bank and opens a portal to Alodi's personal vault before walking back to her original position.''
:{{text|say|Glutonia|You tell that big lug that if he ever wants to pick up where we left off, he can pay me a visit! I'm here every day... whatever the hour!}}

Upon interacting with the portal, you are taken to [[Alodi's Bank Vault]], a small chamber filled with roaming [[Guardian Orb]]s that regenerate shortly after being "killed". Loot the three [[Powerful Mana Gem]]s spread around the vault and then use [[Teleport: Hall of the Guardian]] to return to Alodi.

After turning in the quest, the following occurs:
:{{text|say|Alodi|I trust the Baroness was still there? I don't know how old that [[elf]] is.}}
:{{text|say|[[Meryl Felstorm]]|Uh, I'm pretty sure she's a [[goblin]] now.}}
:{{text|say|Alodi|I suppose even astral entities need a change of pace now and again. It's still a she though... right?}}
