==Objectives==
Bring the Ancient Highborne Data Printout to [[Professor Pallin]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Ancient Highborne Data Printout]]

==Description==
I think I have just the thing to extract the information from this core for you.

<Timofey loads the core into the hopper of a clearly [[goblin]]-made machine, then covers his ears.>

You may wish to avert your eyes, blacksmith.

==Rewards==
* 1,530 [[XP]]

==Progress==
[[Highborne]]! Ancient Highborne! What an amazing find!

==Completion==
...is what I would say if we weren't floating directly above the ancestral home of the Highborne. You need this translated or something?

:{{Text|say|Timofey Oshenko|This core contains a script written in an ancient Highborne dialect, which I can't read. [[Professor Pallin]] in the [[Scribe's Sacellum|Scribes' Sacellum]] may be able to translate this.}}
