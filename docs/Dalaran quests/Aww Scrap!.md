==Objectives==
Take the Crate of Guns down to [[Filgo Scrapbottom]] in the [[Underbelly]].
* [[Crate of Guns]] (provided)

==Description==
It's a catastrophe! No, even worse, a conspiracy!

I heard the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] was back again, and I thought to myself, "Hobart, now's your time to shine."

I made us enough guns to blow those [[demon]]s back to the beginning of time!

But then we get here, and what happens? Everyone just happens to "find" all these ancient artifacts to fight the demons with!

Long story short, I have too many guns and need to get rid of 'em.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
:[[Engineering|Legion Engineering]]

==Completion==
Now that's quite the haul of guns! I suppose these fell off the back of a [[gryphon]], right?

<Filgo gives you a sly wink.>
