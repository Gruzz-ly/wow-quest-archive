==Objectives==
Travel to key locations in [[Azsuna]] and use the Depleted Leyflame Burner to collect ley energy.
* Nar'thalas energy collected
* Dragon Pool energy collected
* Zarkhenar energy collected
* [[Depleted Leyflame Burner#Ley Hunting]] (provided)

==Description==
The leyflame burner you brought me is useless! This is why I never trust an [[engineer]]...

The burner needs to be charged in areas that resonate with ley energy before it can be used to craft our newfound alchemy recipes.

Lucky for us, Azsuna is rich with such power.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you recharged that ley burner yet, <name>?

==Completion==
You imbued the burner with ley energy, eh? Let's have a look.

<[[Deucus Valdera|Deucus]] examines the leyflame burner.>

Yes, this will do nicely! A crucial step in rebuilding the alchemy table.

==Notes==
Go to the [[Nar'thalas Academy]], [[Azurewing Repose]], and [[Ley-Ruins of Zarkhenar]] and use the quest item.

;On completion
*{{Text|say|Deucus Valdera|You should talk to [[Patricia Egan|Patricia]]. I believe she can offer you a new recipe.}}
*{{Text|say|Deucus Valdera|Nicely done! Patricia has a new recipe for you, <name>.}}
