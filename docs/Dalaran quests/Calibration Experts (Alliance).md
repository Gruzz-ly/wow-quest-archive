==Objectives==
Take the Uncalibrated Malloric Burettes to skilled alchemists for calibration.
* Consult [[Myshalla Streambreeze]]
* Consult [[Krimple Proxmeasure]]
* Consult [[Tryks Pourtrue]]
* [[Uncalibrated Malloric Burettes]] (provided)

==Description==
It will take the cooperation of several highly skilled sorts to calibrate these burettes.

Myshalla Streambreeze in [[Feralas]] has demonstrated admirable attention to detail.

I loathe [[Ironforge]], but a resident named Krimple Proxmeasure is known for his precision.

And while I'd never travel to [[Booty Bay]] without a lock on my wallet, Tryks Pourtrue has proven reliable and fair... mostly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
{{Stub-section}}

==Completion==
Yes, I'd say these burettes look well-calibrated.

I knew those three would be meticulous. Never underestimate the value of someone who obsesses over tiny details, <name>!
