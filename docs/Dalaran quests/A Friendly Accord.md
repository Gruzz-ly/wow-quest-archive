==Objectives==
Meet [[Fleet Admiral Tethys]] aboard the [[Crimson Veil]] in [[Booty Bay]].
*Board the Crimson Veil
*[[Gilded Hearthstone]] (provided)

==Description==
I'd like to offer ya an accord.

The [[Dread Admiral Eliza]] wields a pair of cursed blades that have made her the scourge of the south seas. She also stole one of me best ships - the [[Horizon's Edge]] - and has it anchored off the shore of [[Azsuna]] as we speak.

If you help me take back me ship, then her cursed blades are yours.

Now, assuming that sounds agreeable, meet me aboard the [[Crimson Veil]]. We have her docked right in [[Booty Bay]] - not a cheap arrangement.
