Dear <name>,

It has come to my attention that you handled the delivery of a missing parcel. For that, you have my gratitude!

We are in somewhat of a crunch here in the mailroom, and I have need of a capable courier.

If you are interested, please visit my [[Postmaster's Office|office]]. You will find the entrance behind the [[Magus Commerce Exchange]].
