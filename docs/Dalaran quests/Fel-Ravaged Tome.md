==Objectives==
Bring the Fel-Ravaged Tome to [[Robert Newhearth]] in [[Dalaran]].
*[[Fel-Ravaged Tome (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Much of the elven writing in the tome has been singed by fel fire.

The head of the curators in Dalaran is renowned for his restoration skills. Perhaps he can treat the tome to bring it back to legibility.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Oh, what's this one now?

==Completion==
Ah, the burns can be reversed with the right alchemic tinctures.

How interesting.  A formal Darnassian writing style with... demonic affectations.

I suspect I know who penned this.

==Notes==
Upon completing this quest, the cinematic [[Harbingers|Harbingers: Illidan]] plays.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
