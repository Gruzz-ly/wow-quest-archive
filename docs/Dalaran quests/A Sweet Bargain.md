==Objectives==
Find a frost mage in [[Dalaran]] to chill your quenching trough.
* Speak with [[Glaciela Rimebang]]
* [[Nightberry Truffle]] (20) (Optional)
* Speak with Glaciela Rimebang again

==Description==
Reading over this research, I found an interesting method that I'd like you to try.

The method would require us to chill the metal to sub-freezing temperatures during the pre-tempering phase. Simple water quenching won't do.

Good thing you can't walk two steps in this city without bumping into a [[frost mage]]! See if you can recruit one for the shop, <name>.

==Rewards==
* 16,170 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Any luck in finding a willing mage?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Now let's put her to the test!

==Notes==
