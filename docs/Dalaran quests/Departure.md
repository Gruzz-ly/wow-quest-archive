'''Departure''' concludes the {{g|tww}} intro experience, starting [[The War Within campaign]]. The [[Isle of Dorn storyline]] starts immediately after in [[Violent Impact]].

==Objectives==
Find Khadgar back on the surface.
* Seek a different exit
* Return to the surface
* [[Queensguard An'Jak Shabtir]] slain
* Talk to [[Khadgar]]

==Description==
Best if we split up here. I'll guide everyone to safety and see about getting them evacuated.

In the meantime, you should search for Khadgar. I'm sure he could use your aid as well.

You'll find another exit further ahead that should lead back to the surface.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[City Guard's Coronet]]
* [[City Guard's Mask]]
* [[City Guard's Chainmail]]
* [[City Guard's Greaves]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 13,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The portal flickers and twists, making it impossible to see through to the other side.>

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I'll get them to safety. Try to find Khadgar!}}

Trying to leave the area yields:
:{{Text|bossemote|Find your way back to the surface.}}

Head east to the marked exit, past the corpse of [["Red" Jack Findle]], then head upstairs. As players reach the surface, an [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] begins:

{{#ev:youtube|OZ2HYDA-nIY|Departure - Queen Ansurek}}

''A void portal destroys the statue of [[Rhonin]] at the [[Eventide]] and some nerubian flyers take off. A larger portal spawns on the ground between the statue and the bank and [[Queen Ansurek]] walks through it alongside some medium-sized nerubians.''

{{text|bossemote|Queen Ansurek|High in the sky and nowhere to flee...}}

''She looks to the collected nerubians near her.''

{{text|bossemote|Queen Ansurek|Gather all you can find. Bring them below. Xal'atath has plans for them.}}

''The two ground units web up nearby citzens and start dragging them to the portal as Ansurek returns through it while other citizens flee into the bank, leaving the adventurer unharmed. As the ground units drag the webbed characters through the portal, [[Queensguard An'Jak Shabtir]] emerges from it and sets upon the adventurer.''

Aggro:
:{{Text|Say|Queensguard An'Jak Shabtir|Delectable! What a waste to capture you.}}

After the nerubian spiderlord has been defeated, [[Khadgar]] appears:
:{{Text|Say|Archmage Khadgar|There you are, champion!}}

Speak with him:
{{Dialogue|I'm glad to see you're okay.

There's no end to these nerubians. I'm afraid, at least for now, Dalaran is lost to us.

But the people remain. They must be our primary concern.

{{Gossip|quest=|What do you need me to do?}}
}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Take this portal down to Khaz Algar. Those who escaped will still need help.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I must first find Alleria. We'll meet you when we're able.}}

Before leaving, fish in the wishing well to acquire [[Xal'atath's Rusty Coin]].

Also spot other deceased characters in the area, including [[Valaden Silverblade]], [[Rafael Langrom]], [[Bragund Brightlink]], [[Matilda Brightlink]], and [[Icks]]. Then, take [[Khadgar's Portal]].

On complete, a [[The War Within in-game cinematics|pre-rendered cinematic]] plays, The Guardian and the Harbinger:

{{#ev:youtube|wzLWovRyp5Y}}

''Exterior, day. An over-the-shoulder shot of [[Khadgar]], [[Atiesh]] in hand, looking at the ruins around [[Dalaran Merchant's Bank]] at the [[Eventide]]. From behind him, he hears something and turns to look up at the central tower above the [[Violet Citadel]] with five beams channeled upon it. As he walks that direction, the camera cuts to...''

''Interior, Violet Citadel, atop the main stairs. The five beams gather into the [[Dark Heart]], floating above [[Xal'atath]]'s head. Focused on the artifact, she shifts her attention to the doorway to spot Khadgar walking up.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Khadgar. We meet at last.}}

{{text|bossemote|Khadgar|Xal'atath, I presume?}}

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|This city is home to such power, all squandered by the [[Kirin Tor]].}}

''Khadgar walks up to the base of the steps and stops. Xal'atath looks up at the Dark Heart, then back down to Khadgar.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|I'll put it to much better use.}}

{{text|bossemote|Khadgar|Like hell you will!}}

''With a grunt of exertion, Khadgar channels a spell through Atiesh and BLASTS an arcane beam of energy at Xal'atath and the Dark Heart. Apparently expending all of his mana in that shot, he drops to one knee and attempts to catch his breath, using both hands on Atiesh to support himself. He looks up to the top of the stairs to see Xal'atath, floating the Dark Heart above her left hand, walking unscathed out of the cloud of dust. His eyes widen in disbelief.''

''Floating the Dark Heart just in front of Xal'atath's chest, waves of energy stream out from the two void orbs above her shoulderpads and repeatedly blast Khadgar back into a wall. He falls to his hands and knees and Atiesh falls to the ground, split near the middle. As Xal'atath floats down the stairs, a bowshot screams past her, and she dodges to her right to avoid it.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|There you are.}}

''Alleria Windrunner gets into her stance at the doorway of the Citadel and readies another shot. Xal'atath clinches her right fist and launches an attack on Alleria. Alleria can't get her shot off in time, and she drops her bow and clenches her head in pain.''

{{text|bossemote|Khadgar|Alleria!}}

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Get out of my head!}}

''Alleria too falls to her hands and knees, as Xal'atath keeps coming down the steps toward them, chuckling all the way.''

''Looking away from Xal'atath, Khadgar attempts to gather himself as he focuses on Alleria. He raises his right hand and opens a portal beneath her.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Khadgar...}}

''Realizing what's about to happen, Alleria attempts to stop Khadgar, but he will not. Khadgar struggles to get each word out over the force of his exertion.''

{{text|bossemote|Khadgar|This isn't the real fight.}}

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|No!}}

''Alleria falls through the portal, which drops her and her bow on the surface of the [[Isle of Dorn]]. As he uses the last of his mana to port Alleria away, Khadgar collapses to the ground. Xal'atath is now mere yards away from him. He catches himself and looks up at her.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Goodbye, Guardian.}}

''The Dark Heart radiates power and starts expanding a sphere. Khadgar desperately holds up his right hand, but the sphere passes right through it, apparently dissolving his hand and arm. As the sphere expands from the base of the Violet Citadel, the central tower cracks.''

''From Alleria's vantage point on the ground, the outlying floating islands fall to the ground as the sphere keeps expanding. It expands enough to where the main island can no longer keep itself afloat and it starts falling too. Now covering the whole mainland, the orb stops expanding and collapses in on itself, destroying Dalaran in a flash. Boulders start falling out of the sky as Alleria looks on in horror.''
