==Objectives==
Meet with [[Ritssyn Flamescowl]] in the [[Circle of Wills]] beneath [[Dalaran]]. 

==Description==
Greetings, warlock. I speak on behalf of the [[Council of the Black Harvest]].

With the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] invasion upon us, it is painfully clear that our only hope is to grow stronger. The council plans to tap into the [[Twisting Nether]] and call forth more powerful demon allies. The ritual is ready, but we are short one number.

No doubt you have heard of the fate that befell [[Kanrethad Ebonlocke]].

You will be his replacement. Do you accept?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}
* 1,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You have made the right decision.

Let us hope you live up to your reputation.

==Notes==
Shortly after completing [[In the Blink of an Eye]], Ritssyn Flamescowl emerges from a Demonic Portal with this quest.
:{{text|say|Ritssyn Flamescowl|A moment of your time, warlock. The Council of the Black Harvest requests your assistance.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Ritssyn Flamescowl|Join us at the Circle of Wills in Dalaran's [[underbelly]], warlock. My portal will take you there directly. We will be waiting.}}

You can either use the Demonic Portal to get to the Circle of Wills or simply walk down into the Underbelly on foot. Either way, you are placed in a phased version of the Underbelly in which a large amount of [[Felfire Imp]]s are roaming around the area or terrorizing the [[Underbelly Guard (NPC)|Underbelly Guards]]. [[Vaesara]] is harassing another guard, while [[Koulun]] roams around the area, though [[Val'zuun]] remains in his regular spot. In the Circle of Wills, [[Zelifrax Wobblepox]] is standing in the center of the circle, with Ritssyn, [[Zinnin Smythe]], [[Jubeka Shadowbreaker]] and [[Shinfel Blightsworn]] standing around the edges.
