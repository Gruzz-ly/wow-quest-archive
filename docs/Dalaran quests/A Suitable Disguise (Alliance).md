'''A Suitable Disguise''' is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Obtain a [[Borrowed Tabard]] from [[Shandy Glossgleam]] and bring it to [[Arcanist Tybalin]] at the [[Silver Enclave]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Borrowed Tabard]]

==Description==
Getting you inside the [[Sunreaver's Sanctuary]] will be tougher than it appears. Only those who possess Sunreaver tabards are permitted entry to sanctuary. If we can get ahold of one, a simple enchantment will do the rest of the work.

On the balcony above [[Threads of Fate]], you'll find Shandy Glossgleam. I've helped him a few times in the past, so he owes me a favor. He handles laundry for a wide variety of people in the city. Maybe he can find a way to lend you a [[tabard]] for a while.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}  ({{cost|13|23}} at 80)

==Progress==
Was Shandy able to help you get a Sunreaver tabard?

==Completion==
I knew Shandy would find a way to come through for us. Let me get this enchanted and ready for you to use. The sooner you get done with the tabard, the sooner we can get it back to Shandy and the better chances that its owner will never have missed it.

==Notes==
[[File:Shandys Laundry.jpg|thumb|Elemental Laundry service.]]
The [[Threads of Fate]] is directly opposite the [[Silver Enclave]] in [[Runeweaver Square]]. On the upstairs balcony is [[Shandy Glossgleam]]:

:{{gossip|Arcanist Tybalin said you might be able to lend me a certain tabard.}}
:{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|You're in luck. I've got just what you need in the load I'm about to wash.}}
:{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|See the piles of laundry and the bucket of water? I'll call out what I need next, and you put it in the tub. Ready?}}

Did you sign up for [[Lab Work]]? He'll call out one of four items:
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|Quick, add some shirts to the laundry!}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|Add the unmentionables... uh, I mean, the 'delicates'!}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|The tub needs more water!}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|Toss some pants in to the tub!}}

And one of a few random responses:
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|I should keep you around.}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|Well done!}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|That's how it's done!}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|Clean and tidy!}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|Nice. I don't want to know what the stain was.}}
*{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|Aquanos can hardly keep up!}}

When he's finally done, the [[Clean Laundry]] spawns next to the tub.
:{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|[[Aquanos]], stop sending the clothes so high! You didn't have to see the look on [[Aethas Sunreaver|Aethas Sunreaver's]] face when he found his pants in the fountain!}}
:{{text|say|Shandy Glossgleam|See how easy that was with everyone working together? Just take what you need from the clean laundry here, but don't forget to return it when you're finished.}}
