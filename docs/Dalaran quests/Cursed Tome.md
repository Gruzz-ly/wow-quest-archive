==Objectives==
Bring the Fel-Ravaged Tome{{sic}} to [[Robert Newhearth]] in [[Dalaran]].

==Description==
Much of the elven writing in the tome has been singed by fel fire.

The head of the curators in Dalaran is renowned for his restoration skills. Perhaps he can treat the tome to bring it back to legibility.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Oh, what's this one now?

==Completion==
Foul magic wards these texts.

Much stronger than anything I've seen before, but nothing that can't be undone by our mages!

==Notes==
Upon completion, an animated cutscene plays (the Harbingers short for Gul'dan):
