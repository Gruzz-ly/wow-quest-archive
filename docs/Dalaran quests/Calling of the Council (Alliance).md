==Objectives==
Meet [[Archmage Khadgar|Khadgar]] in [[Dalaran]] at its new location above [[Deadwind Pass]].
* Take the Portal to Dalaran over Karazhan in [[Stormwind Keep]]
* Speak to Archmage Khadgar in Dalaran {{co|31.5|43.8|Dalaran}}
* Have Khadgar address the [[Council of Six]] {{co|30.7|48.9|Dalaran}}

==Description==
<The arcane anomaly turns to address you, speaking in what is clearly Khadgar's voice.>

Though I am loathe to interrupt your fight against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]], I must request your help in a matter of... diplomacy. We face a grave threat, and we must be at our full strength to overcome it.

Some will not agree with this position.

Please join me outside the [[Violet Citadel]] in [[Dalaran]]. We have repositioned the city to defend the [[Eastern Kingdoms]]. You'll find it over Deadwind Pass, above [[Karazhan]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|30}}
* 7,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]]'s reaction was unfortunate, but not unexpected. She has endured so much...

Though it was [[Garrosh Hellscream]] who ordered the obliteration of [[Theramore Isle|Theramore]], she blames all the Horde for her loss. I hope one day she can overcome that hatred.

Enough ruminating. We must prepare the Kirin Tor for war.

==Notes==
This quest becomes available upon completing the [[Battle for the Broken Shore]] storyline, ending with [[Illidari Allies]], or, for [[demon hunter]]s, their [[Demon hunter starting experience|starting experience]], ending with [[A Weapon of the Alliance]].

Don't go to [[Northrend]]. Don't go to the [[Broken Isles]]. Head to [[Stormwind Keep]], where there will be a portal to a special phased version of Dalaran floating over Karazhan.

The Dalaran above Karazhan is nearly useless as a capital city, as all of the NPCs are complaining about the abrupt move and will not perform their usual functions - auctions, training, vendors, etc. Khadgar is just outside the [[Violet Citadel]] at {{co|31.5|43.8|Dalaran}} on the Dalaran map, and {{co|41.6|73.2|Deadwind Pass}} on the [[Deadwind Pass]] map. Speak with him.

:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Greetings, <name>. Word has reached me of your efforts to push back against Legion invasion forces.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I am reluctant to interrupt such important work, but I could use your help in a matter of... diplomacy. I fear I am about to anger an old friend.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Dalaran has been repositioned to defend the Eastern Kingdoms. You'll find it over Deadwind Pass, just above Karazhan. Please join me here.}}

;Archmage Khadgar
:How was the flight in? Seems we moved Dalaran from one dark, gloomy land to another.
:At least it's warmer here. And I must admit, being so close to Karazhan brings back many memories.
''{{gossip|How can I help, Archmage?}}''
:''Khadgar walks toward the entrance of the Violet Citadel.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|The Legion's attacks will only intensify. We must do whatever is necessary to bolster our strength.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I propose we invite the [[Horde]] back into the [[Kirin Tor]]. You may not like this idea. Some of my colleagues certainly won't.}}
:''Khadgar pauses his stride for a brief moment before continuing.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Please trust my judgment. A world at war with itself cannot stand against the Legion for long.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|The [[Council of Six|Council]] is already assembled. Let's not keep them waiting.}}

Inside the Violet Citadel, [[Archmage Karlain]], [[Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver]], [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Archmage Modera]], and [[Archmage Vargoth]] are standing around. Speak with Khadgar again:
:This could be uncomfortable. Are you ready, <name>?
''{{gossip|Address the Council, Khadgar.}}''
::{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Thank you all for gathering on such short notice.}}
::{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Khadgar, we don't have time to waste in meetings. The Legion is advancing and the Horde arms for battle.}}
::{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Then I'll get right to the point. For the Kirin Tor to fight at full strength, we need the mages of the Horde to join our ranks.}}
::{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|NEVER! Do you hear me, Khadgar?}}
::{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Jaina, we know the pain you've endured. But this is about--}}
::{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|They obliterated Theramore. They left us to die on the Broken Shore. Again and again they've proven to be monsters... cowards!}}
::{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I've made my case. With respect, I move for a vote.}}
::{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Very well. But consider your choice carefully. If you let those vermin back into this city, I will not be counted among your ranks when you welcome them.}}
::{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|In the matter of allowing the Horde into Dalaran and offering membership in the Kirin Tor, I vote aye.}}
::{{text|say|Archmage Karlain|Aye.}}
::{{text|say|Archmage Vargoth|Aye.}}
::{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Nay.}}
::{{text|say|Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver|Nay.}}
::{{text|say|Archmage Modera|Aye.}}
::{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|The vote carries. I'm sorry, Jaina, but the stakes are higher than they've ever been.}}
::{{text|say|Archmage Modera|Jaina, please... we are doing what's best for [[Azeroth]]. Stand with us!}}
::{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|This Council is blind to the truth. When the Horde betrays you again, remember who warned you. Farewell.}}
::''Jaina teleports away, and Khadgar walks over to take her place.''
::{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|That was... difficult. But we must move forward. We will send our invitation to the Warchief at once. We have a war to win.}}

;Quest completion
: ''[[Brann Bronzebeard]] runs into the building, stopping briefly when he sees that the two he's looking for are present.''
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|<Name>! Khadgar! Thank the Forge I found ye! Ye won't believe it! Me brother [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]]'s back!}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Brann Bronzebeard!? Well, this is unexpected.}}

Brann offers the next quest, [[The Diamond King]].

==Patch changes==
<!-- Unknown Patch: Patch number pulled from WoWhead comments section based on the earliest mention of the portal disappearing. Appears to still be available up to and including patch 7.3.5. -->
*{{Patch 8.1.5|comment=As of this patch or possibly earlier, the portal has been removed from Stormwind Keep's Petitioner's Chamber despite the quest directing the player to go there. Players will need to fly to the instanced version of Dalaran in Deadwind Pass instead.}}
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
