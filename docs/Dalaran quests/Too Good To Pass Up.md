==Objectives==
Obtain a Black Rook Hauberk.
* [[Black Rook Hauberk]]

==Description==
All types of [[Black Rook Hold]] armor are intriguing, but I'm most interested in their chest pieces.

If ye can, try to find someone of importance there and... relieve them of their shirt.

If it makes ye feel any better, I've heard they're all cursed, so puttin' them out of their misery is the least ye could do.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Recipe: Battlebound Hauberk]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Chest armor is the best armor, I always say!

==Completion==
Oh, this is a beauty. Just look at that craftsmanship.

<Thanid looks the piece over very carefully.>

And looking at how it's pieced together, this should be a snap to replicate.

Here, lad, give this pattern a try and see how that works for ye.
