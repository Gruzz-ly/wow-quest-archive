==Objectives==
Craft a pair of Hard Leystone Armguards for [[Alard Schmied|Alard]].
* [[Hard Leystone Armguards]]

==Description==
Now that we have a [[frost mage]] at our disposal, testing this method out should be a cinch.

Here are the plans for what I'd like you to make. Get to work and give me the armguards when you're finished.

==Rewards==
* 16,170 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How's that technique coming along?

==Completion==
Look at that shine!

==Notes==
On accept, the player learns the following item recipes: [[Leystone Slag]], [[Hard Leystone Bar]], [[Heated Hard Leystone Bar]], [[Dull Hard Leystone Armguards]], and [[Hard Leystone Armguards]], and receives 2x [[Shopkeeper's Leystone Ore]].

Use the objects to create required items.

;On completion
