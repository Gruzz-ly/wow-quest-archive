== Objectives ==
Kill [[XT-002 Deconstructor]].

This quest can be completed with any difficulty or size raid.
* [[XT-002 Deconstructor]] slain 

== Description ==
Yet another strange construct of [[Mimiron]], the XT-002 Deconstructor actually thinks that it is the keeper's son.  Do not be fooled by its feigned innocence. It is a deadly machine!

You will find the Deconstructor within Ulduar's [[Scrapyard]].  The [[Council of Six]] has decreed that XT-002 Deconstructor must die! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|33|20}}
*+125 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor]]

== Progress ==
I am given to understand that you have not yet been able to deconstruct the Deconstructor.

== Completion ==
The greatest weakness of Ulduar is its masters' blind faith in their inventions to protect it.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.3.0|note=Added.}}
