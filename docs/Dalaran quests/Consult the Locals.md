==Objectives==
Find a tailor in [[Azsuna]].

==Description==
Whoever wove this fabric CAN'T have intended it only for belts and shoulderpads.  There must be some way to sew thread into this material.

Head on down to Azsuna and try to find a tailor.  We need to sew if we're going to do any real tailoring.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My my, look at you!  Such an attractive young <class>, and all bedecked in magical finery and weaponry.  To what do I owe the pleasure?

Aha!  Tailoring!  It's your lucky day, er...

I'm sorry, what was your name?  <Name>?

It's your lucky day, <name>!  I happen to be one of the best tailors in [[Suramar]]...

==Notes==
''Accept:''
: {{text|say|Tanithria|I heard a passing [[adventurer]] mention something about a tailor setting up shop in Azsuna, within the [[Greenway]].}}
