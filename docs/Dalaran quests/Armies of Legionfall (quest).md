* Meet Khadgar at Krasus' Landing

==Description==
Thanks to your leadership, the <class> [[Class Hall|order]] has grown even mightier than I had dared hope. Alongside champions of the other orders, we now have a fighting force capable of driving the [[Burning Legion]] from our world.

It's time to end this invasion! Using the [[Pillars of Creation]], we will dissipate the [[Felstorm]] and seal the [[Tomb of Sargeras]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Armies of Legionfall]]

==Completion==
Our forces are assembled. We are ready to begin.

==Notes==
On accept
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Heroes of [[Azeroth]], your [[Class Hall|class orders]] have grown mighty throughout our campaign on the [[Broken Isles]]. Their strength, their courage, is needed now. The time has come to unite our forces and rid Azeroth of the Burning Legion.}}

On approach
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Welcome, <class title>. Let's get this assault under way, shall we?}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|We will divide our forces to hit them from all sides at once.}}

Near Khadgar, all of the class order sub-leaders can be found: [[Darion Mograine]], [[Meryl Felstorm]], [[Ritssyn Flamescowl]], [[Lord Jorach Ravenholdt]], [[Lady Liadrin]], [[Farseer Nobundo]], [[Kor'vas Bloodthorn]], [[Alonsus Faol]], [[Emmarel Shadewarden]], [[Iron-Body Ponshu]], [[Rensar Greathoof]] and [[Havi]]. They have no dialogs. Curiously, [[Velen]] is missing despite appearing in the following cutscene.
