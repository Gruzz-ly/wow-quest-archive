'''Time Crisis''' begins '''Legion Remix'''. The new Timerunner is thrown into [[Dalaran]] above the [[Broken Isles]]. Unlike the original timeline, this version of Dalaran is still under attack...

==Objectives==
Talk to Moratari and then find Khadgar.
*Talk to [[Moratari]]
*Speak with [[Khadgar]]'s mirror image on [[Krasus' Landing]].

==Description==
You don't remember me?

Hmmm, [[Time travel|shifting through time]] can sometimes have that side-effect.

Good thing I love introductions.

Let me catch you up to speed on what we're doing here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||2}}
*700 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Progress==
Khadgar needs your help.

==Completion==
<Name>! You surely are a welcome sight to see on this dark day. Our [[teleportation]] spell went awry and now the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] is invading [[Dalaran]].

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{Text|say|Moratari|<Name>! There you are. I thought we'd lost you.}}

Before accepting the quest, Moratari has gossip:
{{Dialogue|
These are exciting times, <name>.

{{gossip|Haven't we done this before? {{text|red|<Skip this chapter and receive your artifact weapon.>}}}}<br>
{{gossip|Play Movie=|What just happened?}}
}}

The skip option, for alts of characters who have completed the initial questline, will do as warned after accepting a confirmation window:
{{dialogue|Are you sure? This chapter's quests will be abandoned and unearned rewards will be lost. You will receive the artifact weapon for your current specialization. This action cannot be undone.}}

Pick the movie option and the [[Legion in-game cinematics|in-game cinematic]] for [[In the Blink of an Eye]] plays:

...

After picking up the quest, speak with her again:
{{dialogue|
I'm Moratari.

You and I are studying this timeline together, along with a few others.

However, the teleportation of Dalaran has had a mishap, which seems to have affected you and the city in unforeseen ways. Dalaran is being overrun by the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] and Archmage Khadgar needs your help.

He should be projecting an image around here somewhere to help direct the city's defenses and organize the safety of Dalaran's citizens.

Find Khadgar and offer him your assistance.

{{Gossip|Play Movie=|Teleportation of Dalaran? What just happened?}} ''(if not chosen earlier)''<br>
{{Gossip|Wait, I'm a bit concerned about my missing memory of you, Moratari.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Ironically, we don't have a lot of time at this particular juncture to sort out what happened to you.

The short version is that the time travel and Dalaran's teleportation spell in this timeline have gone awry. I'm not sure exactly how, just yet, but I'm sure your gaps in memory were caused by that.

Right now, though, we need you to focus on defending Dalaran. I can promise you answers as soon as I get them myself.

{{Gossip|Ok, let's take this slow. Who are you again?}}
:''Returns to the beginning.
{{Gossip|quest=|That's a lot to take in, but you can count on me, Moratari.}}
}}
{{Gossip|quest=|That's a lot to take in, but you can count on me, Moratari.}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Moratari|Your memory loss is certainly unexpected. Help Khadgar while I try to figure out what happened.}}

Approach the mirror image of Archmage Khadgar who is commanding a group of [[Kirin Tor Guardian]]s:
:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|[[Kirin Tor]], stand firm! We must hold the line against the Legion!}}
