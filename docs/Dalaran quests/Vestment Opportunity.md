==Objectives==
Obtain a Hideshaper's Vestment.
* [[Hideshaper's Vestment]]

==Description==
While the [[vrykul]] of [[Northrend]] wore strong armor, their craftsmen always had the strongest.

Go to [[Stormheim]], search for someone who knows about leather armor, and bring their chest piece back to me.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Recipe: Warhide Jerkin]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How's your search going?

==Completion==
<Diane examines the chest piece thoroughly.>

This has some very interesting design. I think we can easily copy what they've achieved with this piece.

Here, try this pattern out.
