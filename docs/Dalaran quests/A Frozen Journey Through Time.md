==Objectives==
Defeat 5 Timewalking dungeons.
* [[Timewalking]] [[dungeon]]s defeated (5)

==Description==
The chill star shines upon the land with its cold light as even the spirits retreat to the shadows. This star is unlike any other in the skies, sapping warmth and life. While its influence holds, new paths may open up, to distant places and even distant times. No [[sage]] truly understands the nature of this sign, but fortune favors the daring.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Timely Goodie Bag]]

==Progress==
I foresee that you will follow the chill star and walk the paths it reveals.

==Completion==
Ah, <name>, you have returned. An chill air hangs heavy about you.
