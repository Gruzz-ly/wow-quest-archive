You've already learned the patterns for bracers, belts, epaulets, and of course, robes. Unfortunately, your technique was wasteful... you need a better method.

==Progress==
Keep your eye on your needlework. Don't lose focus now.

==Completion==
Now isn't that just lovely. Go on, try it out yourself!

==Notes==
Upon accept, you will learn how to create Basic Silkweave Robe and Embroidered Silkweave Robe.

Like before, various objects become active. Loot [[Tanithria's Sharpened Spritethorn]], [[Tanithria's Blue Dye]], and [[Tanithria's Green Dye]] for the required recipes.
