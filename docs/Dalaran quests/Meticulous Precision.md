==Objectives==
Bring the Spritethorns to [[Tiffany Cartier]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Sharpened Spritethorn]] (150)

==Description==
The needles are sharp, but look at them closely. Some have a curve to them, others have a spur hanging off the side. Look at this one... it's got a ninety-degree crook in it! I have no desire to sew around a corner.

Tiffany Cartier in the [[Cartier & Co. Fine Jewelry|jewelcrafting shop]] has a good eye for this sort of thing. Bring these needles to her, and she'll straighten them out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,340 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's this, <name>?

==Completion==
Look at these! Strong, light, flexible, sharp, with a refined curve and a smooth edge. You've certainly put your Dalaran touch on it. It's the best of both worlds!

Enough fussing over our tools, now. Shall we sew?
