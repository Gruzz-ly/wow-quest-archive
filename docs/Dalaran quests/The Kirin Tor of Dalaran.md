* {{Hotfix|date=2016-11-29|bluenote=On the afternoon of Sunday, November 27, to alleviate an issue where too few Kirin Tor World Quests were available to allow for reliable completion of the Kirin Tor Emissary quest, we hotfixed that Emissary quest to autocomplete on login. This was a stopgap measure while we work on a proper fix to the underlying issue; we intend for future occurrences of the Kirin Tor Emissary quest to work as expected, like other Emissary quests.|link=http://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/20303039/}}
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
