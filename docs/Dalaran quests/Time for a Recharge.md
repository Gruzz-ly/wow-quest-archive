==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Schematic: Rechargeable Reaves Battery]]

==Completion==
I been thinkin' more about this whole battery thing, and how the whole process is just so... wasteful.

I ain't goin' green or nothin' like that - I'm just worried about our bottom line!

You know, if one were to supercharge one of these batteries with some [[:Blood of Sargeras]], maybe cap it off with some concentrated [[leystone]]...
