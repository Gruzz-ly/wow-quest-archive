==Description==
Noth the Plaguebringer, traitor and coward! Second only to the [[Lich King]] himself for the number of souls that have been Scourged!

Make haste to [[Naxxramas]]. You will find him within the Plague Quarter hiding behind his [[undead]] minions.

Destroy him! The [[Council of Six]] has decreed that Noth must die!

==Progress==
Noth yet walks Naxxramas, <class>.
