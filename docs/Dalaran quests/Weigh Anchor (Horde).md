==Objectives==
Bring the Crate of Felslate to [[Kruda Thunderhand]] at [[Bilgewater Harbor]].
* [[Crate of Felslate]]
* Deliver the crate to Kruda

==Description==
<Name>, I was hoping to ask you for a small favor. The naval fleet at Bilgewater Harbor have been requesting large amounts of [[:felslate]] to help construct supplies for their ships.

I'm pretty busy here coordinating the gathering efforts and all my couriers are still out. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking that shipment over there to them?

I heard there's a portal to [[Orgrimmar]] in the [[Windrunner's Sanctuary]] here in [[Dalaran]] so it shouldn't be a long trip or anything.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Plans: Felslate Anchor]]

==Progress==
Did [[Arcanomancer Vridiel|Vridiel]] send you?

==Completion==
More felslate, fantastic! This stuff weighs a ton, and is perfect for anchors.

I see you have the arms of a blacksmith. Perhaps you'd like to have a hand at making a few anchors as well, eh?

==Progression==
