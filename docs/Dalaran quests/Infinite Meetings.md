==Objectives==
Tour the [[Infinite Bazaar]].
* Meet [[Nostwin]]
* Meet [[Momentus]], again
* Meet [[Horos]]
* Meet [[Hemet Nesingwary XVII|Hemet]]
* Meet [[Larah Treebender|Larah]]
* Meet [[Pythagorus]]

==Description==
There, [[Dalaran]] is back to how it should be.

I'm sure you have many questions, <name>. Who are we? What are we doing here? Why are you here?

The simple answer is this: We are [[Infinite dragonflight|the Infinite]], we are searching through time for answers to questions larger than any of us, and we need your help to do it.

I think you will come to understand this answer more if you meet the rest of our flight. [[Moratari]], if you would make the introductions?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|1|23}}
*1,700 [[XP]]
*[[Elixir of Remembered Sight]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Progress==
As their name would suggest, the infinite dragonflight is certainly not lacking in numbers.

==Completion==
As you can see, <name>, there are many minds at work here in the infinite dragonflight. Minds that are all working to answer some pressing questions.

What knowledge can we gain to prepare us for even greater threats?

Would we have triumphed if things had been worse?

What are the implications of [[Sword of Sargeras|Sargeras's sword]] being [[Silithus: The Wound|plunged into Azeroth]], and was it the artifacts that saved Azeroth or something else?

Er, I mean... Forget I said anything. [[What sword?]]

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Eternus|Our goal with this experiment is to see how history would have played out if some of the variables were changed.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Get acquainted with the rest of our temporal excursion. I am excited to see what differences you have yet to make.}}

Find the various NPCs on the island:

[[Nostwin]] is off to the northeast, selling snacks:
:{{text|say|Moratari|This is Nostwin--our resident expert on being a teenager. Nostwin, are you awake?}}
:{{text|say|Nostwin|I'm awake! I'm awake.}}
{{dialogue|title=Nostwin|Oh, hi!

I'm Nostwin.

Are you hungry?

I have snacks!

{{plainlist|
* {{gossip|quest=|Sure, I could eat.}} ([[Everlasting Nosh]])
* {{gossip|quest=|No, thank you.}}
}}

<Nostwin hands you something delicious to snack on, and then munches on some himself.>

I love snacks. Oh, and naps.

So, if you ever need snacks or naps come see me. I've been studying inn keeping and have perfected the art of pre-warming beds for guests.

Also, I solved the issue of crumbs in bed, so now you can snack and nap without worry.

{{plainlist|
* {{gossip|quest=|I'll set my hearthstone here then, for now.}}
* {{gossip|quest=|Maybe another time.}}
}}
}}

[[Momentus]] and [[Erus]] are by the forge. He starts [[Just Between Us]]:
:{{text|say|Moratari|And you have already met Momentus, our circumspect blacksmith.}}
:{{text|say|Momentus|On that note, Moratari, I have some data points for you, but they can wait. Good to see you again, <name>.}}
{{dialogue|title=Momentus|Good to see you again, <name>.

If on your journeys you have need of another weapon, you can always find me here at the Infinite Bazaar.

{{gossip|quest=|I'll be sure to do that.}}}}

[[Horos]] sells pets and toys:
:{{text|say|Moratari|Allow me to introduce Horos. A collector of rare things.}}
:{{text|say|Horos|Well, well, well. What have you brought me this time, Moratari?}}
:{{text|say|Moratari|This one is not for collecting, Horos. <Name> is assisting us in our research.}}
{{dialogue|title=Horos|A treasure to meet you, <name>.

Eternus has tasked me with collecting rare things and creatures across time.

Purely for study, of course.

But not to worry. As rare and as intriguing as you may be, it would be immoral to collect a sentient being such as yourself.

{{buy|Let me browse your collection.}}<br>
{{gossip|quest=|Thank you for the compliment, Horos. It was nice meeting you.}}}}

[[Hemet Nesingwary XVII]] sells mounts, new and old:
:{{text|say|Moratari|Hello Hemet. How are the animals today?}}
:{{text|say|Hemet Nesingwary XVII|Ach. Tha beasties are fine. Looks like you've got yerself a helper there. What's yar name, friend?}}
{{dialogue|title=Hemet Nesingwary XVII|
The name's Hemet Nesingwary, tha seventeenth.

Surely you've 'eard of my esteemed and grand familial lineage.

{{buy|Let me browse your goods.}}<br>
{{gossip|quest=|That's quite the pedigree, Hemet.}}

The Nesingwary bloodline runs deeper and longer than the mightiest river, and is possessing of a fearsome, almost preternatural ability to identify beasts great and small purely by the scent ov thar droppings carried on the faintest of winds.

When Eternus asked if I wanted to travel to the distant past to hunt the same critters as me ancestors, I couldn't pass up the chance.

All I gotta do is keep an eye on these beasties and make sure they don't get in the rubbish.

{{gossip|quest=|You've got a good looking menagerie of animals there.}}
}}

[[Larah Treebender]], [[Unicus]], [[Lindormi]], and [[Nedward]] are to the southeast:
:{{text|say|Moratari|This is our fashion historian, Larah. She probably has the best job here.}}
:{{text|say|Larah Treebender|You are too kind, Moratari, but all these clothes don't fold themselves.}}
{{dialogue|title=Larah Treebender|
Fashion is as much a reflection of the times as anything. My job in the Infinite is to keep my finger on the pulse of what people are wearing and why.

After all, if you want to do good, you've got to look good.

{{gossip|quest=|In a way, our clothes wear us as much as we wear them.}}}}

[[Arturos]], [[Aeonicus]], [[Durus]], [[Sacerdormu]], and [[Pythagorus]] are to the northwest, selling dungeon and raid apparel:
:{{text|say|Moratari|Pythagorus, I want to introduce you to <name>. They are a friend, so no smashing. Ok?}}
:{{text|say|Pythagorus|Ok.}}
{{dialogue|title=Pythagorus|
Hello, little <race>.

I'm here to make sure the little ones don't get into trouble they can't get out of.

But sometimes little ones get into trouble in places I can't fit, or when I'm not around. So I sell them nice shiny weapons and armor for when I'm not there.

Then later I go beat up whoever needs beating up. Sometimes I bring Erus. He's always in the mood for a good scrap.

{{gossip|quest=|That is very good to know. Thanks for looking out for everybody.}}}}
