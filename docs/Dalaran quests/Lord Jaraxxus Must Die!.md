== Description ==
[[Archmage Timear]] has foreseen a horrible event, which is about to transpire. A foolish [[Wilfred Fizzlebang|gnome warlock]] is about to accidentally summon an [[Eredar]] lord of the [[Burning Legion]] into the middle of the [[Trial of the Crusader]].

You must be there when it happens, <class>. If Lord Jaraxxus escapes, he will open a portal and the Burning Legion will spill forth into our world once more.

The [[Council of Six]] has decreed that Lord Jaraxxus must die!

*{{cost|29|60}}

== Progress ==
Why are you here speaking with me when you should be dealing with Lord Jaraxxus? You have no time to waste, <class>!

== Completion ==
All of [[Azeroth]] is fortunate that Timear foresaw the Eredar lord's arrival and that you were there in time to slay him.
