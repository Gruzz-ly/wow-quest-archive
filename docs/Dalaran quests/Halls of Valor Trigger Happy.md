==Objectives==
Obtain the Runestone of Vitality from [[Odyn (tactics)|Odyn]] in the [[Halls of Valor]].
* [[Runestone of Vitality]]

==Description==
In order to complete my latest invention, I need a special relic known as the Runestone of Vitality.

Odyn, king of the [[Halls of Valor]] is known to use it to breathe life into his constructs.

What I'm asking is no easy task, but I need to take the runestone from Odyn and bring it back to me.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Schematic: Trigger]]

==Progress==
I'm glad you're the one going up against a god and not me.

==Completion==
Keep your fingers crossed, <name>, and let's hope this works.

<Hobart takes the rune and starts channeling its power on a pile of gun parts.>

Yes! YES! It's alive, ALIVE!

Now I can mass-market these gun parts as toys for children!
