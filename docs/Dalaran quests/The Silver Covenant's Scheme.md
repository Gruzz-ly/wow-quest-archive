This quest is part of the {{questchain|The Return of Quel'Delar|Return of Quel'Delar}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Capture the Silver Covenant Orders.
* [[Silver Covenant Orders]]

==Description==
One of my contacts in the [[Underbelly]] caught sight of a [[Silver Covenant Agent|Silver Covenant agent]] gathering information at the [[Cantrips & Crows|Cantrips and Crows Tavern]]. Silver Covenant members aren't normally found in the sewers, so they must be plotting something.

Go into the Underbelly, find this Silver Covenant agent, and eliminate him. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from [[Wyrmrest Temple|Wyrmrest]]. We can't let those simpering Silver Covenant weaklings get it back to [[Icecrown]] before we do.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
Did you find anything of use on that agent? 

==Completion==
<Magister Hathorel reads the captured orders.>

The agent you intercepted was supposed to deliver the Wyrmrest tome to [[Icecrown]], after meeting with one {{NPC||Arcanist Tybalin}} inside the [[Silver Enclave]]. We have to reclaim that book, <name>, and we only have one chance before it leaves the city. We have to work quickly.

== Notes ==
The [[Silver Covenant Agent]] is located next to Innkeeper [[Ajay Green]] at the Cantrips and Crows Tavern in the [[Underbelly]].
