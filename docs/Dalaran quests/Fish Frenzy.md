'''Fish Frenzy''' is the quest that rewards the [[Underlight Angler]].

==Objectives==
Follow [[Nat Pagle]] to the [[Gloaming Reef]], then dispatch all of the fish in the area.
*Speak with Nat Pagle in Dalaran
*Gloaming Reef fish dispatched
*Return to Marcia in Dalaran

==Description==
<NAME>!

<pant, pant>

You've got to see it! The fish, they're... they're everywhere!

Off the coast of [[Val'sharah]], something's whipping them up into a frenzy.

I've never seen better fishing in my life!

I've got a boat down below. Grab your pole and I'll take you there!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Underlight Angler]]

==Completion==
What in the world have you brought me?! Nat told you to ask me to turn THIS into a pole?

<Marcia takes the severed lure from you. As she holds it close to the pearl, it begins to resonate with it.>

That's interesting. There seems to be a connection between this and the pearl. Maybe turning this into a fishing rod can yield some interesting results...

==Notes==
Speak to Nat:
*Howdy.
*How's about some fishing?
*Ever dipped your foot in some water and it's really cold?

:{{gossip|I'm ready.  Take me to this fish frenzy of yours.}}

This will cause the player to enter a single-player scenario with Nat at the [[Gloaming Reef]], off the shore of [[Val'sharah]].

===Stage 1 - Kill Murlocs===
*Slay all of the murlocs on the island.
:{{text|say|Nat Pagle|This is the place. Unfortunately it's teeming with murlocs.}}
:{{text|say|Nat Pagle|If you can take out those murlocs, it'll be easy fishing for the rest of the day.}}

Kill every last murloc on the island.

===Stage 2 - Fishing===
*Fish up the Gloaming Frenzies.
:{{text|yell|Nat Pagle|You did it, <name>! Now let's fish up those frenzies!}}

Get 15 [[Gloaming Frenzy]] by fishing in the pools and killing the [[Underlight Deepfeeder]]s that semi-frequently spawn.

===Stage 3 - Delivery===
*Give Nat your Gloaming Frenzies.
Turn in the fish to Nat, at {{co|36.9|55.9|Gloaming Reef}} on the southwestern part of the island.
:{{text|say|Nat Pagle|As I was running around fishing up the frenzies, I noticed some bubbles over in this lagoon.}}
:{{text|say|Nat Pagle|I'm wondering if whatever's down there is what's been causing them to act up. Let's see if I can't rustle it up from where it's hiding.}}
:''Nat throws the barrel of fish into the water...''

===Stage 4 - What's below?===
*Fish up what's been disturbing the frenzies.
:{{text|say|Nat Pagle|Oh yea! There's definitely something down there. Let's fish it up, <name>.}}
Fish in the [[Roiling Whirlpool]].

===Stage 5 - Mglrrp===
*Slay Mglrrp.
:{{text|yell|Nat Pagle|What in the great sea is that thing?!}}
:{{text|yell|Nat Pagle|Quick! Kill it with fire or whatever it is you adventurers use!}}

[[Mglrrp]] spawns. Kill it.

===Finale===
:{{text|say|Nat Pagle|What a beast! And a great catch to boot!}}
:{{text|say|Nat Pagle|You know, that lure on the top of it's{{sic}} head would make for a great fishing rod...}}
:''Nat starts hacking off a part of Mglrrp.''
:{{text|say|Nat Pagle|Yea, I know that may seem gross, but just look at it! Fish'll come flocking towards something like that.}}
:{{text|say|Nat Pagle|Here, you take it. Give it to Marcia in Dalaran. She's great at turning things into fishing rods.}}
:{{text|say|Nat Pagle|You can take my boat there to get back if you have no other means.}}

A [[Boat to Dalaran]] spawns - take it to return to [[Marcia Chase|Marcia]] in Dalaran.
