'''A Fixed Point in Time''' concludes the [[Legion Remix]] introduction questline. From here, the greater [[Legion campaign]] opens up. Don't forget the [[Order Hall Campaign]] either!

==Objectives==
Talk to Moratari and return to Krasus' Landing.
* Fly with [[Moratari]] to [[Krasus' Landing]]

==Description==
By now, the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] will have been fully purged from [[Dalaran]] and events will begin unfolding. Events that require your presence, <name>.

Moratari will take you back to Krasus' Landing. There your legend will continue to grow.

I see great potential in you, <name>. No matter which timeline you're from.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{abilities|[[Infinite Knowledge]]|Grants +1 Infinite Knowledge which increases the amount of Infinite Power gained from most sources.}}

You will unlock access to the following:
:{{abilities|Skyriding|Unlocks the ability to ride [[skyriding]] mounts, using momentum and paired abilities to traverse the skies.|id=445964|icon=ability_dragonriding_dragonridinggliding01}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost||12|30}}
*210 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]
*[[Perfected Epoch Memento]]
*[[Remixing Time]]

==Completion==
And here we are, back where it all started.

In a moment a messenger will come looking for you and your legend will begin to unfold.

<Moratari smiles broadly at you, beaming with excitement.>

Aren't you excited? I know I am.

Oh, and if you need anything, just come by the Infinite Bazaar. We're always waiting.

Good luck!

==Notes==
Find [[Moratari]] to the north, not far from the Portal to Dalaran:

:{{text|say|Moratari|If you're all set, let's get you back to Dalaran so you can rejoin the flow of events. You're always welcome back here, though!
}}

{{dialogue|
When you're ready to depart I'll take you back to Krasus' Landing.

{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready to depart.}}<br>
{{gossip|I'm not ready to depart yet.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Moratari|One moment, please.}}
:''Moratari shifts to her dragon form.''
:{{text|say|Moratari|There we go. It feels good to stretch my wings. Hang on.}}
:{{text|say|Moratari|Don't let this get to your head, but Eternus almost never gives anyone that much praise.}}
:{{text|say|Moratari|I should know. After all, I've known her for... well, forever.}}
:{{text|say|Moratari|So take heart in knowing that what you are doing here is important.}}
:{{text|say|Moratari|When we get back to Krasus' Landing we're going to get you a flying mount all your own.}}
:{{text|say|Moratari|After all, we're supposed to be keeping a low profile here.}}
:{{text|say|Moratari|And I don't want to fly you all around the Broken Isles myself.}}
:{{text|say|Moratari|Watch your step.}}

Moratari next starts the [[Skyriding (quest)]] tutorial, which can be skipped, and the [[Order Hall Campaign]] will start automatically:
* Death Knight: [[The Call to War (quest)]]
* Demon Hunter: [[The Future of The Fel Hammer]]
* Druid: [[A Summons From Moonglade]]
* Hunter: [[Needs of the Hunters]]
* Mage: [[Felstorm's Plea]]

* Paladin: [[An Urgent Gathering]]
* Priest: [[Priestly Matters]]
* Rogue: [[Call of The Uncrowned]]
