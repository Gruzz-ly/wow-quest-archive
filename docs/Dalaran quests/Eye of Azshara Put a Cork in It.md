==Objectives==
Go to the [[Eye of Azshara (instance)|Eye of Azshara]] and retrieve the Advanced Corks for [[Deucus Valdera]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Advanced Corks]]
* [[Wrath of Azshara]] slain

==Description==
A thought occurred to me recently, <name>. The [[naga]] have been known to hoard all manner of potions, so they might have the sort of corks we need.

In my educated opinion, I believe the best place to start searching is around the Eye of Azshara!

Try not to waste your time in there dealing with the naga's goings on, just look for some replacement corks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,340 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The sooner we get my supplies back, the quicker we can get back to real work.

==Completion==
What's this? The spoils from another of your adventures, eh? Let's have a look.
