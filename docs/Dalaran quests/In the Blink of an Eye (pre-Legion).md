This version of '''In the Blink of an Eye''' is the lead-in quest used for characters that completed the introduction quests during the ''Legion'' pre-patch.

==Objectives==
Witness the teleportation of [[Dalaran]] to the [[Broken Isles]].

* Take the Portal to Dalaran over [[Karazhan]]
* Dalaran's Teleportation Witnessed

==Description==
The Broken Isles is our destination, <name>.

The spell that will blink Dalaran to its new location is not a simple one.  It will take [[Council of Six|this Council's]] full energy and attention.

As [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] is... absent, [[Kalecgos]] of the [[blue dragonflight]] has offered the [[Kirin Tor]] his aid.

The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] will make every attempt to stop us, but we will not falter.  It is time to begin!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive: {{cost|3|85|}}
|item1=Dalaran Hearthstone
|q2=5|item2=Tome of the Tranquil Mind
}}

* 3,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, <name>, it's good to see you on your feet! The members of the Council of Six are recuperating from their ordeal.

The intensity of the teleportation spell can be disorienting. It seems you lost consciousness for a time, but at least you didn't awaken to find yourself stuck in a wall!

Dalaran has been relocated to the Broken Isles. From here, we will spearhead the effort to acquire the Pillars of Creation and drive the Legion from [[Azeroth]] once and for all!

==Notes==
The first time you log into ''Legion'', at  [[Khadgar's Upgraded Servant]] will immediately appear near you with this quest, wherever you are in the world. Should the elemental despawn before you have accepted the quest, move to a different subzone. The questgiver should quickly reappear.

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|We must gather our strength. The spell to move the city will be taxing.}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Modera|We've never moved Dalaran twice in such a short span of time.}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Kalec|I will aid you as best I can. It is an honor to serve the Kirin Tor.}}

{{Dialogue|
The Legion bears down on us. We have but moments to spare.

The shockwave of [[arcane]] energies we are about to unleash should prove powerful enough to send them back to their [[Twisting Nether|cursed dimension]] for a time, giving us time to catch our breath and begin the search for the [[Pillars of Creation]].

Are you ready?

{{gossip|I am ready, begin the teleportation of Dalaran to the Broken Isles.}}

:''The view changes to the Chamber, where the Council of Six are channeling their powers. Khadgar continues to speak as the camera pans around to show each council member.''
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|Today is the day that we re-take our world.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|And send the Legion back to the hell that spawned them.}}
:''With the spell complete, the view shifts back outside. A massive orb of arcane energy expands from Dalaran, engulfing the Legion ships and destroying them, then Dalaran teleports away and manifests itself in the city's new location...''
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|Our path is clear.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|The Pillars of Creation await.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|On the Broken Isles!}}

;Quest completion
:{{text|say|Emissary Auldbridge|The resources of Dalaran are at your disposal. From here, heroes of [[Alliance]] and [[Horde]] alike will search for the Pillars of Creation!}}
:{{text|say|Emissary Auldbridge|I've heard rumors of powerful artifacts that may be of use in your campaign. Keep an eye out and a useful lead just might present itself!}}
:{{text|say|Emissary Auldbridge|Now I must attend to other visitors. Good luck, <name>!}}
:''Emissary Auldbridge leaves, walking past the [[Magus Commerce Exchange]] and up the stairs into the [[Violet Citadel]], despawning inside.''

There will be no follow-up quest offered immediately. Walk around Dalaran for a bit, and eventually a representative from your [[Class Order]] will show up and offer a quest to start establishing your [[Class Hall]] and acquiring your first [[artifact]].
