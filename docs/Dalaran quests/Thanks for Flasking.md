Take the repaired Dual-Chambered Mixing Flask to [[Deucus Valdera]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Dual-Chambered Mixing Flask]]

==Description==
Here is your flask, good as new. A fair trade for those potions.

Be a little more careful with your breakables next time!

==Rewards==
You will receive:

==Completion==
Barm did his work, then? I hoped that [[Highmountain tauren|tauren]] would come through!

This is a very useful addition to my alchemy table.
