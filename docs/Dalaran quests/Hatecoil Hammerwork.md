* [[Masterwork Hatecoil Breastplate]]
* [[Masterwork Hatecoil Pauldrons]]

==Description==
There may be a way to jump-start our research into leystone.

I've heard reports of [[naga]] camps down in [[Azsuna]]. If they've been in Azsuna for long enough, their [[smith]]s have certainly started experimenting with leystone themselves.

Be on the lookout for some leystone armor on the naga... ideally something more elaborate than a bracer.

==Rewards==
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I still marvel at how quickly those things can swim in plate armor.

==Completion==
Of course! They've found their way around the welding problem by simply crafting their armor out of one solid piece of metal.

The shoulderpads I should have figured out on my own, but their work on the breastplate really is remarkable.

Here, let me jot down a few patterns so you can make these yourself.
