==Objectives==
Ask around the city for information on [[Levia Laurence]].
*Ask about Levia at the [[Scribe's Sacellum]]
*Ask about Levia at the [[Militant Mystic]]
*Ask about Levia at the [[Legerdemain Lounge]]
*Investigate Levia's belongings

==Description==
Levia Laurence was once a member of the [[Kirin Tor]]. Dabbling in shadow magic got her banned from [[Dalaran|the city]], but she knows the streets too well to keep her out for good. 

Levia has disappeared, and I'm gravely concerned. Her work may have attracted the attention of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. It has before. It would be very dangerous if her knowledge fell into their hands.

She was last seen at the Scribe's Sacellum. Ask around there and see if you can pick up her trail.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So it seems that Levia has fallen under the spell of a succubus' seduction. I fear her time alone as an outcast must have left her vulnerable to such tactic. I cannot help but feel some guild for her turning down this path.

In any case, Levia is a great danger. She must be found!

==Notes==
;Ask [[Professor Pallin]]
:{{gossip|Do you know where I can find Levia Laurence?}}
::Yes, yes, yes, Levia. Tall girl? Light hair? She was in here buying scrolls and ink - said she needed to make runes for a ritual or something.

::She mentioned something about a specific kind of staff she needed, but we don't deal in those items here. I sent her off to the Militant Mystic.

::Maybe you should check there?

;Ask [[Icks]]
:{{gossip|Do you know where I can find Levia Laurence?}}
::Hmm... Laurence... let's see...

::Oh yes, she was in the other day. She was looking for a staff with some very particular properties. A funny thing, really, because it seemed the kind of staff I would normally procure for one of my warlock customers.

::It took me a few days to get it, but I found one and had it delivered to the Legerdemain Lounge at her request.

;Ask [[Amisi Azuregaze]]
:{{gossip|Do you know where I can find Levia Laurence?}}
::Levia... yeah, I know her. She stays here every now and then. Last time was a couple days ago.

::Shadow magic is a dangerous thing - that's why the Kirin Tor aren't fond of it in the city - but the things she dabbles in are a far cry worse than your average fare. I wish she'd at least conduct her business outside of the city.

::You're welcome to check upstairs and see if she left anything behind.

;Investigate Levia's Belongings
:<Levia's notes detail the precise components and incantations necessary to make contact with a powerful [[demon]]. The final page seems to contain Levia's personal reflections before performing the ritual.>

:In all of the [[Kirin Tor]]'s research into succubi and other [[sayaad]], they have come to one conclusion - they are not to be trusted. But after meeting [[Agatha (demon)|Agatha]], I am left to wonder, were they wrong?

:She has already granted me such power as I had never touched as a [[mage]] of the Kirin Tor, and she cares for me more than any on their [[Council of Six|council]] ever did.

:There is only one way I can know for sure. I must go to her.

;Ambushed
:''As the [[adventurer]] leaves the room, two succubi appear and briefly stuns them.''
:{{text|say|[[Iphisil]]|My, it looks like Agatha's stumbled on another fun little plaything.}}
:{{text|say|[[Uhrlia]]|I do hope this one is more entertaining than the last.}}
:{{text|say|Iphisil|Worry not, Uhrlia - this one looks spry. Surely <he/she> won't give up so easily.}}
:{{text|say|Iphisil|Let's play, warrior!}}
:''The adventurer slays them both.''
:{{text|say|Uhrlia|Agatha... will be... pleased...}}
:{{text|say|Iphisil|That was... exquisite...}}
