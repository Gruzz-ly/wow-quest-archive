'''A Mysterious Warning''' begins the post-launch [[The War Within campaign]], starting in the [[Portrait Room]] of [[Dalaran]] above the [[Broken Isles]]. Players must have completed the earlier portions of the intro experience (starting with [[The War Within (quest)]] and ending with [[The Bronzebeard Family]]) to be eligible for this quest.

==Objectives==
Discuss the next steps, then follow up with Khadgar.
* Talk to [[Khadgar]]

==Description==
Well, that was quite the nap. I wasn't expecting [[Azeroth]] to be so... loud. To normal folk, she's gently calling out. But with our connection, it felt like she was screaming. Directly into my crystal noggin.

I saw it though. [[Khaz Algar]], an island of [[earthen]], bathed in fire and smoke. That's where [[Azeroth (titan)|Azeroth]] is trying to lead us.

That's what we need to protect.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Khaz Algar...

==Completion==
The [[Council of Six|council]] has decided. We travel to Khaz Algar.

[[Dalaran]] will teleport as soon as we're able. Will you lend us your aid in our preparations?

==Notes==
Before accepting the quest, Khadgar has new gossip:
{{dialogue|If only the good news of Magni's recovery wasn't marred by this terrible vision he received...

Still, we must learn more.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Dagran Thaurissan II]]|Khaz Algar! The [[titan]] installation mentioned in [[Uldaman]]'s records.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|And it may now be in danger. We must convene the Council.}}

Characters have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=[[Magni Bronzebeard]]|Tell me, champion. Can a crystal heart still beat? I certainly don't feel it in this old chest of mine.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Moira Thaurissan]]|Seems like the old coot is perfectly fine now. And here he had me all worried!}}

{{dialogue|title=Brann Bronzebeard|Damn brothers and their damn habit of falling asleep trying to talk with [[planet]]s and whatnot...

<Brann hastily wipes his misty eyes.>

Ach, I'm getting soft in me old age.}}

{{dialogue|title=Dagran Thaurissan II|I'm so glad Gran'da is alright now. We haven't spent much time together, and the thought of him...

But it's okay now! He looks like he's fully recovered.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]]|Finally, an answer to all our questions. You should speak with Magni and hear more about the vision he received.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Thrall]]|I'm glad Magni's awake. [[Elemental Unrest|Last time]] he fell unconscious trying to connect with Azeroth, well... It was a much longer wait.}}

{{dialogue|title=[[Anduin Wrynn]]|Even through all his bitterness, Magni still proves himself to be a true Speaker of Azeroth.}}

Speak with Khadgar:
{{dialogue|I must discuss Magni's revelation with the Council of Dalaran. Please wait here while we convene.

{{gossip|quest=|I'll wait for you here.}}

An [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cinematic plays]], Drenden's plan:

{{#ev:youtube|CVh67GqaISQ|Drenden's Plan}}

''Interior. The Portrait Room of Dalaran. Present to the left are [[Brann Bronzebeard]], [[Magni Bronzebeard]], [[Moira Thaurissan]], and [[Dagran Thaurissan II]]. To the right are [[Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Thrall]], [[Anduin Wrynn]], and the [[adventurer]]. Walking down from top middle are [[Khadgar|Archmage Khadgar]], with [[Ansirem Runeweaver]], [[Karlain]], [[Drenden]], and [[Modera]] of the [[Council of Six]] behind him.''

{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|Once more, Dalaran is called to the aid of our world. Magni?}}

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|Azeroth showed me a vision of a city in flames in the ancient lands of Khaz Algar.}}

''[[Alleria Windrunner]] silently walks up as Magni explains.''

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|Her voice was desperate--we must act quickly.}}

''Khadgar turns his attention from Magni to Alleria and they share a look.''

{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|Archmage Drenden has proposed, and the council agrees...}}

{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|that we bring the full force of Dalaran to this "Khaz Algar."}}

''Khadgar scans the room from right to left.''

{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|Make ready our people, and prepare the city for teleportation.}}

''The adventurer salutes.''

{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|Whatever lies ahead, we will face it together.}}

After the cutscene, characters have new gossip:

{{dialogue|title=Moira Thaurissan|If there really is a chance that there's earthen on Khaz Algar, you can be sure I'm coming along. Someone will need to establish relations.

We can't just go in hammers swinging.}}

{{dialogue|title=Magni Bronzebeard|Khaz Algar is the stuff of legends. A titan installation built by the earthen and watched over by the [[keeper]]s. Back when the keepers were around, in any case.

To think the stories were true...}}

{{dialogue|title=Dagran Thaurissan II|Khaz Algar! Do you know how amazing this is? Scholars weren't even sure it existed.

Are the earthen still there? What are they like? What titan [[technology]] do they watch over?

I must learn everything I can.}}

{{dialogue|title=Brann Bronzebeard|Now this is my element! A place only known in [[Flavor lore|myth]]? Sounds like the perfect place for the [[Explorers' League]].}}

{{dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|So our destiny awaits in Khaz Algar. What will we find there? Beyond fire and smoke, that is.}}

{{dialogue|title=Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Khaz Algar. That's what the [[Radiant Song]] was trying to tell us. And so, that is where we must go.}}

{{dialogue|title=Thrall|A titan installation... I'm starting to see why Azeroth reached out to us about it being attacked.}}

{{dialogue|title=Alleria Windrunner|I'd be off to Khaz Algar by now if I thought I could outfly Dalaran. That, and Magni refuses to tell me where it is. It's as if he doesn't trust me to stay put.

Well. I suppose there's precedent for that.

{{gossip|What have you been up to since our investigations together?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I continued to search for [[Xal'atath]] and her damned [[Dark Heart]]. Now that she has the ability to convert [[arcane]] magic into [[shadow]], I wasn't keen to let the situation... fester.

No leads yet, though. I had hoped her interest in me may lead to something, but she's kept awfully quiet.

Like a [[lynx]] before its{{sic}} pounces.}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Archmage Drenden|If Khaz Algar is in danger, Dalaran must come to its aid. Just as we have done so for our world so many times before.}}

After completing the quests, some characters once again have new gossip:

{{dialogue|title=Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Dalaran, Horde, and Alliance. Rallying together to protect our world.

Just as it should be.

{{Gossip|Remind me of the events so far.|Play Movie=}}
}}

{{dialogue|title=Thrall|The council has decided. Dalaran will rally to Khaz Algar's aid.

Still, that doesn't mean we should rush in blindly. We must first prepare.

{{Gossip|Remind me of the events so far.|Play Movie=}}
}}

{{dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|Once, I would have rallied to this cause. But now I can't help but see everything that could go wrong. What missteps await us on the path we chose today?

I can only pray that I'm wrong.}}

{{dialogue|title=Magni Bronzebeard|Don 't be mistaking me. We need to get to Khaz Algar Without delay. But ach am I still tired.

Azeroth really packs a wallop when she wants to.}}
