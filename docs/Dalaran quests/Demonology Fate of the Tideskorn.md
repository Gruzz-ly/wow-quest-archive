==Objectives==
Search [[Jandvik]] for the [[vrykul]] mentioned in the scrolls.
*Speak with [[Huntsman Slodi]]
*Speak with [[Priestess Bryna]]
*Speak with [[Yngvild the Watcher]]
*[[Scrolls of the Faldrottin]] (provided)

==Description==
A scout from [[Greywatch]] arrived yesterday with a signifigant discovery - these ancient scrolls. Within they contain a [[Valkyra]] prophecy of a new vrykul ruler - one who could turn the [[Tideskorn]] against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].

It slightly complicate matters that this vrykul may in fact be [[God-King Skovald|Skovald]]'s heir. Take the scrolls, find the heir, and bring her to the Valkyra. I think the outcasts they refer to are the vrykul of Jandvik, so that would be a good place to start.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|One minor detail. If this prophesied leader truly is the God-King's heir, Skovald's demise may prove to be a point of contention.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|So just to be safe, I wouldn't mention how the would-be God-King met his end.}}

;Huntsman Slodi
''If you have done the [[Jandvik]] quest chain:''
:Hail <class>.

:I know of [[Toryl]]'s editct - you will know no harm by my blade.
:{{gossip|I am searching for the vrykul mentioned in these scrolls.}}
::I know little of prophecies, but we have seen new faces in Jandvik since the fall of Skovald.

::You should speak to Priestess Bryna. Her dwelling is in the center of the town. She may know of this prophecy you speak.

''If you have not done it:''
:Tread carefully, <class>. The vrykul of Jandvik are wary of outsiders.
:{{gossip|I am searching for the vrykul mentioned in these scrolls.}}
::I do not know why you dabble in vrykul prophecy, but the scrolls you carry look genuine. I will alert the vrykul of Jandvik to allow you to pass so you may search for the one you seek.

::Priestess Bryna is the most scholarly of the village. Perhaps you should seek her out?

;Priestess Bryna
:I heard Slodi's horn. I take it you are the outsider he was announcing?
:{{gossip|Slodi mentioned you could help find the vrykul mentioned in these scrolls.}}
::I am familiar of the Valkyra prophecy of the Faldrottin, but I have not read their text. Let me see the scrolls you found.

::<Bryna pores through the scrolls' text.>

::If these scrolls are correct, that would mean we may have the heir of Skovald in our midst! Regardless of what the Valkyra believe, you would be doing us a service by removing her from here.

::Seek out Yngvild in the tower overlooking the town. She keeps a keen eye on the comings and goings of Jandvik, and would have noticed if anyone of note has visited lately.

;Yngvild the Watcher
:I'm keeping my eye on you, outsider.
:{{gossip|Have any vrykul passed through here that struck you as odd?}}
::As a matter of fact, yes there is.

::A wandering shieldmaiden came through just recently, and has set up camp outside of town. She stayed only long enough to purchase supplies and avoided all eye contact while she was here.

::I was going to check on her to find out her business here, but you are welcome to go in my stead. You'll find her camped on the beach to the East.
