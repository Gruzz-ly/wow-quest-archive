==Objectives==
Obtain Katterin's Alchemy Kit from [[Katterin the Blistered]] in [[Stormheim]].
* [[Katterin's Alchemy Kit]]

==Description==
The substance you brought me appears to be precipitating powder, a highly volatile reagent used by the [[vrykul]] in their recipes.

There are rumors that a vrykul elder named Katterin has built up quite a store of this powder. A substance this dangerous needs to be in our hands, not hers!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's hope you find the powder we need...

==Completion==
The [[ghost]] of [[Svena the Infused|Svena]] appeared again? Seems she doesn't take kindly to our attempts to learn these vrykul recipes...

Thankfully, the satchel you recovered has all the precipitating powder we require for the alchemy table. Another victory for us!

==Notes==
Katterin is in [[Katterin's Hideaway]]. After killing her, [[Svena the Infused]] appears.
