'''Necklace Repair''' is a [[jewelcrafting]] quest, requiring 375 skill and a single [[Chalcedony]] to complete. Other than completing the [[Dalaran]] jewelcrafting daily quests, and trading [[Titanium Powder]] for tokens, it is the ''only'' other source of [[Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token]]s.

==Objectives==
Repair the necklace with a single [[:Chalcedony]] and return it to [[Timothy Jones]] in at the [[Jewelcrafters Shop]] in the [[Magus Commerce Exchange]] in [[Dalaran]].

*[[Beautiful Chalcedony Necklace]]
*[[Damaged Necklace#Quest Item]] (provided)

==Description==
This damaged necklace has an invoice with it that reads "Property of Timothy Jones - [[Cartier and Co Fine Jewelry]] - Magus Commerce Exchange - Dalaran".

Perhaps you should repair it and return it to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}} 
*[[Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token]]
*+25 [[reputation]] with the [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
What brings you here?

==Completion==
How did you find this!  Many of these necklaces were looted from one of my shipments a few weeks ago!  Let me repay you with this [[Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token|Jewelcrafter's Token]].

==Notes==
The [[Damaged Necklace]] that starts the quest is not bound and can be traded or sold on the [[auction house]].
