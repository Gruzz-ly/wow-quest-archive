==Objectives==
Strengthen [[Dalaran]]'s defenses.
* Wards strengthened (4)
* [[Tuning Wand]] (provided)

==Description==
Magni's vision foretells that [[Khaz Algar]] may be enduring some... turbulent times. And so it is best to ensure that Dalaran is ready for the worst.

Here, take this wand. It's been attuned with Dalaran's defense magics.

Just wave it near strategic parts of the city to strengthen our magical defenses.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|21|6}}
* 7,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We will be hard pressed to save Khaz Algar if our own defenses aren't strong enough to withstand attack.

==Completion==
Well done, champion.

Let's just hope it's enough. I would hate for anything to happen to our city right as the world needs us most.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Archmage Drenden|If Khaz Algar is under attack, we must prepare for the worst.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Drenden|You'll need to perform the strengthening spell in key locations. The wand will do the rest.}}

The character gains the Archmage's Vision buff:
:{{abilities|Archmage's Vision|You are able to see the wards that protect Dalaran.}}

Wards are at the [[Violet Citadel]], the northern [[Bank of Dalaran]], [[Dalaran Merchant's Bank]] to the south, and outside the [[Violet Hold]].

After the quest, Archmage Drenden has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|I'm glad I was able to help the council see reason. All of Dalaran shall be called upon to defend Khaz Algar.

Just as it was meant to be.}}
