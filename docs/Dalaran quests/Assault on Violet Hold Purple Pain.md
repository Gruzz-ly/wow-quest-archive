'''Assault on Violet Hold: Purple Pain''' is the introduction dungeon quest for [[Assault on Violet Hold]].

==Objectives==
Repel the Assault on Violet Hold.
* Repel the Invasion of Violet Hold

==Description==
Again!  [[Containment|It happened again!]]

Sure, it's the the{{sic}} [[Burning Legion|Legion]] that staged the prison breakout this time, but I *told* them it was a bad idea to keep some of the most dangerous beings on [[Azeroth]] in a prison inside our city!

We can talk about relocating later, I suppose.  Right now, we've got some... pacification to tend to.

Can you help?

==Rewards==

* 31,520 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Oh, no.  Don't tell me something ELSE has gone wrong?!

==Completion==
Whew.  That's a SECOND invasion dealt with.  Well done.

Now, who do I talk to about getting this place shut down?
