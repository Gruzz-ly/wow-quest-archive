==Objectives==
Obtain 6 Chewed Aethril Stems from [[Withered]] in [[Azsuna]].
* [[Chewed Aethril Stem]] (6)

==Description==
I believe we may be able to use this clue to our advantage, <name>.

The [[withered]] are notoriously thirsty for [[mana]], and will stop at nothing to get it. Perhaps we can study how they use the [[:aethril]] and use the results to improve our own harvesting methods.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Legion|Herbalism Technique: Aethril (Rank 2)]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I am glad you continue to come to my shop, <name>. I am useless with a weapon. We need [[adventurer]]s like you to solve cases like this.

==Completion==
<Your trainer examines the stems, fingering the individual bite marks.>

If you'll pardon my language, they really gnawed the crap out of these things.

Look more closely, though. You can see that they focused on extracting the energy from the stem's central filament...
