==Objectives==
Speak with Linzy Blackbolt and Kuhuine Tenderstride to secure a work order for [[:Foxflower Flux]].
* Speak with [[Linzy Blackbolt]]
* Speak with [[Kuhuine Tenderstride]]

==Description==
Now that we know the foxflower flux is safe to use, we can start stocking it. That being said, I don't particularly feel like picking flowers. Do you feel like picking flowers? Didn't think so.

Go talk to the alchemists and herbalists across the way. I'm sure we can set up some sort of work order arrangement.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 1,530 [[XP]]

==Rewards==
Have you spoken with the alchemists and herbalists yet?

==Completion==
Now that that's all taken care of, we can move on to improving our recipes.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Kuhuine
:{{Gossip|Alard at the blacksmith shop will need a regular supply of foxflower. Do you have any?}}
:{{Text|say|Kuhuine Tenderstride|Of course. Our herbalists bring in plenty of foxflower. I will make sure to set some aside for your metalwork.}}

;Speaking with Linzy
:{{Gossip|Alard at the blacksmith shop will need a regular supply of foxlower flux. Can you make any?}}
:{{Text|say|Linzy Blackbolt|Whoah! Neat recipe. As long as the herbalists keep bringing me fresh foxflower, I can certainly make this preparation for you. No problem.}}
