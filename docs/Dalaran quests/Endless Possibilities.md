==Objectives==
Bring the Fel Reaver Husk back to [[Didi the Wrench]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Fel Reaver Husk]]

==Description==
Say, since you're down here, I have something that you might be interested in.

<Filgo points over to a husk lying in the junk behind him.>

I found that thingy down in [[Azsuna]], just lying on the beach. I'm sure with a little tinkering, an engineer like you could probably get it up and running in no time.

Might even be useful against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. Kind of like fighting [[fel]] with fel, heh!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54|}}
* 1,510 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is there something you need fixed?

==Completion==
How did you get your hands on this?!

<Didi begins inspecting the husk.>

Do you realize what we could do with something like this? Our own personal [[fel reaver]]?!

We could lay waste to our enemies!

We could advance our knowledge of science and [[technology]]!

We could make it serve us drinks!

==Notes==
''Complete:''
: ''[[Reaves]] spawns nearby [[Brassbolt Mechawrench]], and Didi walks over to start working on it as she speaks.''
: {{text|say|Didi the Wrench|I'll get started on fixin' it up with stuff I have around the shop.}}
