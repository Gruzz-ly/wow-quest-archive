==Objectives==
Obtain 150 Spritethorns.
* [[Spritethorn]] (150)

==Description==
[[Talismanic Textiles|This shop]] has almost everything we need. Unfortunately, the quality of your sewing needles is lacking.

I do know where you can get better needles. The [[sprite]]s of [[Val'sharah]] are covered with spines which, fortuitously, are perfect for the type of sewing we need.

I hate to be such a prickler stickler, but these needles really will make a difference.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,340 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Your friend thinks these needles will make a difference?

==Completion==
Hmm... he may have a point.

These needles ARE quite strong, and they have a nice bounce to them. Still, I do take issue with their shape and feel. I have an idea.
