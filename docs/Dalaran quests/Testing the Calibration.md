==Objectives==
Test the [[Malloric Burettes]]' calibration by crafting a variety of potions.
* [[Potion of Deadly Grace]] (10)
* [[Potion of the Old War]] (10)
* [[Unbending Potion]] (10)
* [[Leytorrent Potion]] (10)

==Description==
Now that you have the burettes calibrated, it's time to test it out! The only way to be sure is by crafting a sufficient quality of a variety of potions.

Glamorous work? No, but the most important reagent in alchemy is a bit of elbow grease!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The only way to be sure the burettes are working is to use them!

==Completion==
That's quite an armload of potions you made! I think it's safe to say that these burettes are working as intended.

I'll add them to the alchemy table.

==Notes==
It is not necessary to ''craft'' the items, you can just buy them at the [[Auction House]].

;On completion
:{{Text|say|Deucus Valdera|You should talk to [[Patricia Egan|Patricia]]. I believe she can offer you a new recipe.}}
