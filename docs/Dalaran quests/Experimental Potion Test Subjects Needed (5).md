==Completion==
Want to earn a few quick coins? I need test subjects to try my newest potion.

I've had several requests for vegetarian potions. You'd be surprised how many potions have meat in them!

To compensate for the complete lack of carcasses in this potion, I've had to make a few substitutions. I hope you like crushed-up bits of glass and rotten fish guts!

Fish aren't animals, right?
