==Objectives==
Seal Legion Portals around [[Dalaran]].
*[[Legion Portal (Dalaran)|Legion Portal]] Sealed (2)

==Description==
[[Khadgar]] is close to divining the source of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] presence here, but there is no guarantee that he will if the Legion's plans proceed unchallenged. The fate of Dalaran is not yet decided. All he needs is a little more time.

You can buy him that time by halting the Legion's efforts here in the city.

Seek out Legion Portals and seal them. That should slow the arrival of more demons entering the city.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||71|51}}
*1,550 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]
*500x [[Infinite Power]]

==Progress==
Sealing those Legion portals will slow them down considerably.

==Completion==
I can sense the power emanating from your artifact from here. Good.

I've also noted that it hasn't fractured under the power load yet. Also good.

Let me just make a note of that for Moratari's records. Very good.

==Notes==
Four Legion Portals are marked on the minimap, on the upper floors of buildings in central Dalaran.

Upon accepting [[As A Matter of Artifact]], [[Get Plenty of Exorcise]] and [[Scavenger Hunting]]:
