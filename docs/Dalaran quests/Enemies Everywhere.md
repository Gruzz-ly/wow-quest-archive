==Objectives==
Defeat the hidden [[infiltrator]]s in [[Dalaran]].
*[[Punchy Lou]] slain
*[[Hannis Shoalwalker]] slain
*[[Savash Windcaller]] slain
*[[Hugh Mann]] slain
*[[Classic Larry]] slain
*[[Li-An Skymirror]] slain
*[[Innocent Jim]] slain
*[[Sister Might]] slain

==Description==
Hold a moment, <name>. While I look into this orb of yours, why don't you look into something for me?

I have long suspected an infiltration of Dalaran but after an embarrassing encounter with [[Aerith Primrose|a local florist]] I've withheld my accusations until I'm absolutely certain.

Have you noticed citizens among us that seem just too mundane? Almost inhumanly so? [[Spy|Spies]], serving dark masters, watch and wait until our backs are turned. Root them out, but try and keep it quiet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Wondrous Wisdomball]]

==Progress==
Have you disposed of our friends?

==Completion==
I appreciate your discretion, <name>.

Now, look here! I have imparted all of my substantial worldly wisdom into this globe, in addition to my ruggedly handsome features. No doubt you will find my counsel invaluable in your travels.

I could only get it to say a handful of phrases, however, so be VERY SPECIFIC in your questions.
