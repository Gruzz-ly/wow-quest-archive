==Objectives==
Craft a pair of Sturdy Stonehide Boots.

You will need to use Namha's Tanning Rack and Namha's Workbench, located in Legendary Leathers.
* [[Sturdy Stonehide Boots]]

==Description==
You've been busy, <name>. And you have some new patterns in your repertoire, I see!

How about we add another?

==Rewards==
You will learn: {{Abilities|Recipe List: Broken Isles Boots|id=194813|icon=ui_profession_leatherworking}} ([[Warhide Footpads]] and [[Battlebound Treads]] recipes)

You will also receive:

* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm very excited to see how this turns out.

==Completion==
I'm still amazed at how easily this leather takes shape. It's so flexible, yet keeps its strength.

I think from here you can take my pattern and make it your own.
