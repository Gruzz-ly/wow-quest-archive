'''The Future of The Fel Hammer''' starts the Demon Hunter Order Hall Campaign in [[Legion Remix]], allowing the player to choose between [[Altruis the Sufferer]] and [[Kayn Sunfury]] as their champion.

==Objectives==
Choose your personal champion.
* Speak with [[Moratari]] to choose a champion

==Description==
Oh wait! Of course, right when I send you off I remember the most important thing!

The you-of-this-timeline made a critical choice for the future of all [[demon hunter]]s. The follower they chose to be their personal champion created two diverging timelines for the fate of the [[Illidari]]. 

You will need to choose which of these diverging timelines to explore. What rings true to you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||2|}}
*180 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Progress==
Have you made a choice?

==Completion==
Very well, we will study this version of the timeline. Let us see what the Illidari hold in their future--err, past.

==Notes==
Speak to [[Moratari]] to make the choice given during the [[A New Direction]] quest from the [[Demon hunter intro experience]].
