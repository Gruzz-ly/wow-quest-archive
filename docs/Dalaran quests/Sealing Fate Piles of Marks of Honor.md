==Objectives==
* [[Mark of Honor]] (20)

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Seal of Broken Fate
}}

==Progress==
These seals provide an additional chance at treasure in dungeons and raids, but at what cost? Killing others isn't honorable, and yet you collect marks for honor? I suppose I can use those marks for an additional treasure. That is the offer I present.

Remember, you can only obtain three seals per week. This counts as one of those three. Next week, I will have others.

==Completion==
A simple exchange with complex results.  That's the art of doing business.
