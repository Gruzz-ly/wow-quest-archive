'''The Harbinger''' begins the {{g|tww}} prelude storyline, "Hunt for the Harbinger", part of the [[Dark Heart campaign]] added in [[patch 10.2.7]].

Players will earn the [[Bow of the Ranger Captain]] and [[Arsenal: Voidtouched Weaponry]] appearances, the [[Winding Slitherdrake: Void Scales]] drakewatcher manuscript, and the [[Hunt the Harbinger]] achievement as rewards for completing the quest chain.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Khadgar]] and [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] in the [[Chamber of the Guardian]] in [[Dalaran]].
* Approach the Chamber of the Guardian
*Speak to Alleria
* [[Dalaran Hearthstone (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
We are in need of your aid once more, champion. A mysterious figure moves within the shadows. [[Xal'atath|The Harbinger]]...

Let us speak in the Chamber of the Guardian. I've asked Alleria to meet us there as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*5x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
A [[Radiant Song]], a [[Dark Heart]], and this mysterious Harbinger... What could it all mean?

==Completion==
We know [[Iridikron]] gave the Dark Heart to the Harbinger. But what the Dark Heart is, what the Harbinger plans to do with it... Those are mysteries still.

And the Radiant Song. Its timing is no coincidence.

This matter can no longer wait. That is why I've asked you and Alleria to investigate.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|We are in need of your aid once more, champion. A mysterious figure moves within the shadows. The Harbinger...}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Let us speak in the Chamber of the Guardian. I've asked Alleria to meet us there as well.}}

Use the provided [[Dalaran Hearthstone (quest item)]] for a free teleport to the [[Dalaran]] above the [[Broken Isles]]. Head to the [[Chamber of the Guardian]] and seek out [[Alleria Windrunner]]:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Khadgar said you would come. I thought it best to wait for you.}}

On the way, [[Karlain]] and [[Drenden]] have a conversation:
:{{text|say|Archmage Karlain|It's been too long, Drenden! Glad to see you back in Dalaran.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Drenden|It has. I'm grateful the [[Council of Six|council]] accepted me back so readily.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Karlain|Of course. We're always in need of a mage of your talent.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Drenden|And I mean to put those talents to good use, you can be sure of that.}}

As do [[Modera]] and [[Ansirem Runeweaver]]:
:{{text|say|Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver|What was it like, Modera? The Radiant Song.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Modera|It was warm. Comforting. Like coming home. Yet I couldn't tell you exactly why that was.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver|Fascinating. And you still have no idea why it chose you? None of the other council members have yet to see it.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Modera|I have no idea. Let's hope that [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]]'s investigations prove fruitful. The sooner we understand this vision, the better.}}

Jaina has gossip:
{{Dialogue|Khadgar told me that he sent you and Alleria to investigate the Dark Heart. Glad to know we have our best on the case.}}

Speak with Alleria:
{{Dialogue|Khadgar sounded rather urgent when he contacted me. We should head inside and hear him out.

{{gossip|quest=|{{text|rare|(Play Scene)}} Very well. Let's speak with Khadgar.}}

This starts an [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-game cinematic]]:

''Alleria and the player walk up to Khadgar and Jaina, in the middle of a conversation.''

:{{text|bossemote|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|My people are no strangers to voices from below...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|but this "Radiant Song" is different.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|It's being heard all across [[Azeroth]].}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|The Council doesn't know what to make of it.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|There must be someone who does.}}

''Jaina opens a portal and walks toward it.''

:{{text|bossemote|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I'll let you know what I find.}}

''She takes the portal and it closes behind her. Khadgar turns his attention to Alleria and the player.''

:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|Alleria!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|It's been too long, old friend.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Good to see you, Khadgar.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Doing well?}}

''Khadgar chuckles.''

:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|As well as can be expected.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|How's the family?}}

''Alleria winces.''

:{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|I haven't...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|<sighs>}}
:{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|...it's better if I keep my distance.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|Ah, of course...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|the [[Void]].}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|That would be... erm...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|<clears throat>}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|Actually, your connection to the Void is why I asked you here.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|We still don't know what this "Dark Heart" relic is capable of...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|But we do know it's in the hands of someone called...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|"the Harbinger."}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|Who they are--and what they intend to do--}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|remains a mystery.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|Which is why I need your help.}}

''Alleria laughs.''

:{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|To hunt down a dangerous foe we know nothing about?}}
:{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Honestly, I could use the distraction.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|Same old Alleria, Void or no Void.}}

''Alleria looks away and Khadgar realizes what he said.''

:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|<sighs>}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|Uh...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Archmage Khadgar|I didn't mean to...}}
:{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|See you soon, Khadgar.}}

''Alleria walks away with a wave.''

:{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Dark Heart in hand.}}

After the cutscene, Khadgar has gossip:
{{Dialogue|The Dark Heart and The Harbinger... I fear dark times are ahead of us. This storm never seems to end, <name>.

At the very least, I'm glad to have you by my side.

{{gossip|What do we know about the [[Dark Heart]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
The Dark Heart began as a relic hidden away in the [[Forbidden Reach]]. We believe it was similar to the [[Demon Soul|Dragon Soul]]. Perhaps a prototype rejected by [[Deathwing]]?

Iridikron stole this relic and traveled to the far past alongside the [[Infinite Dragonflight]], to a time when the world was ruled by [[Proto-dragon|primal dragons]] and the [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]] were not even yet the Aspects. He then infused the relic with the power of [[Galakrond]], a powerful primal dragon who nearly devoured the entire world.

And so the Dark Heart was created. But Iridikron did not keep the relic for himself. Instead, he gave it to an ally. A figure we know only by name. The Harbinger.

{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Play Scene from Dawn of the Infinite)}} Can you remind me how Iridikron empowered the Dark Heart?}}
{{gossip|Tell me about something else.}}}}

{{gossip|I want to hear more about The Harbinger.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Unfortunately, there is not much I can tell you about them.

We know they are allied with Iridikron and that they possess the Dark Heart. And so we can assume they are a powerful individual with a dangerous agenda.

That is why I've asked you and Alleria to investigate. Who is the Harbinger and what do they mean to do with the Dark Heart? Questions I hope that we can answer before something terrible occurs. So that we can stop it.

{{gossip|Tell me about something else.}}}}

{{gossip|You mentioned a Radiant Song...?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
We've heard reports from across Azeroth of individuals seeing a vision filled with light and benevolence. However, that's all we know. Whatever the Radiant Song means to tell us, we still do not know.

Jaina has agreed to further investigate the matter. If she uncovers anything, I will be sure to let you know.

{{gossip|Tell me about something else.}}}}}}

==Trivia==
In [[patch 10.2.7]], level 70 players were automatically pushed the quest on login. If the quest was abandoned, it could be picked up from [[Khadgar's Summons]]. Because these were technically separate (but identical) versions of the quest, when [[patch 11.0.0]] was released, phasing issues caused the auto-accepted version to be impossible to complete, as the NPCs would not appear in the [[Chamber of the Guardian]]. The version started from Khadgar's Summons continues to work.
