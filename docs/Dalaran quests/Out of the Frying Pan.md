Meet with [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]] in [[Azsuna]].

==Description==
Oh hello, <name>. I tell you, ever since I was given this shop, it's been nothing but a headache. I can't seem to ever find what I'm looking for.

Which reminds me, Brann Bronzebeard has sent for you. He's in Azsuna tracking down more pieces of whatever it is he's searching for.

Now where'd those pewter drinking cups go...

I'm close, <name>. I can feel it in me bones!

==Notes==
Brann Bronzebeard can be found in front of a tent at [[Llothien Highlands]], overlooking [[Illidari Stand]].
