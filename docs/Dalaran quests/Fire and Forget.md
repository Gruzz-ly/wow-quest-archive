==Objectives==
Test out the Prototype Pump-Action Bandage Gun on [[Wounded Kirin Tor Guardian]]s in [[Dalaran]]. Use the gun to calibrate it when needed.
* Wounded Guards Bandaged (3)

* Use the gun again to calibrate it once more
* Wounded Guards Bandaged (3)
* [[Prototype Pump-Action Bandage Gun]] (provided)

==Description==
They say, "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade." Well, life gave me a butt-load of guns.

So I've been figuring out ways to turn these guns into useful tools.

My latest modification is a gun that shoots bandages! Imagine it, you're on the battlefield, you see your ally go down, you pull out your bandage gun, shoot him with it and bam, he's back in the fight!

I just need you to test it first and make sure it's safe.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Schematic: Pump-Action Bandage Gun]]

==Completion==
Good job on calibrating the power. Shame about those first few though...

I've adjusted the numbers on the schematic to the new specifications so you should be able to make the safe version.

==Notes==

;After first calibration
*{{Text|say|Wounded Kirin Tor Guardian|What the...?! I guess that feels better.}}
*{{Text|say|Wounded Kirin Tor Guardian|Who throws a bandage at someone? Honestly?}}

;After second calibration
