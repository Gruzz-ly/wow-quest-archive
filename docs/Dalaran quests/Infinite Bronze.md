==Objectives==
Forge infinite bronze.
*Arrived at [[Tanks for Everything]]
*Anchor materials prepared
*Temporal fibers separated
*Anchoring materials infused
*Infinite Bronze forged

==Description==
Now that we have the stabilizing materials and the frayed threads we can get to work.

I am, however, forbidden from directly interacting with this timeline. So, you'll need to be my hands. Not to worry, nothing forbids me from giving you some guidance.

Head next door to the forge inside [[Tanks for Everything]] and we'll get to work.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||71|50}}
*1,550 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Progress==
Infinite bronze, a material loaded with potential.

==Completion==
Now that you have infinite bronze we can get you an artifact in order to properly carry out our tests.

Then you'll have no problem living up to your own legend, <name>.

==Notes==
Head east to [[Tanks for Everything]]:
:{{text|say|Momentus|First we'll need to use the forge to prepare the anchoring materials and separate the infusing power from them.}}

Interact with the [[Forge (Dalaran)|Forge]], the [[Fibers and Threads]], the [[Anchoring Materials]], and the [[Infinite Bronze (object)|Infinite Bronze]] in turn:
:{{text|say|Momentus|Good job. Now we need to separate the temporal fibers from the frayed threads.}}
:{{text|say|Momentus|Excellent. Now infuse the fibers into the anchoring materials.}}
:{{text|say|Momentus|Perfect. Now we just forge the infused anchoring materials into infinite bronze.}}
:{{Text|say|Momentus|Brilliant! You've done it. You've forged the infinite bronze.}}

After interacting with the Forge, a tray of [[Infusing Crystals]] appears on the nearby table. They are not used for anything with and disappear after interacting with the Anchoring Materials.
