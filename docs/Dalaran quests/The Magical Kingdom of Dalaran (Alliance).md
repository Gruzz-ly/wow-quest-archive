==Objectives==
Deliver the Kirin Tor Signet to [[Archmage Celindra]] at the [[Violet Gate]] in [[Dalaran]].
*[[Kirin Tor Signet]] (provided)

==Description==
Hello, <name>. You may or may not be aware that we [[Kirin Tor]] moved our city here to [[Northrend]].

No longer does Dalaran sit under its protective dome on the shores of [[Lordamere Lake]]. Now the city magically floats above the [[Crystalsong Forest]].

We believe you to be ready for your journey to the city. Speak with me again and I will cast a spell of teleportation to transport you there.

When you arrive, seek out Archmage Celindra and give her my signet as proof that we spoke.

==Progress==
Greetings, <class>.

==Completion==
Welcome to Dalaran.

I'll see to it that the ring is returned.

==Notes==
If you like saving over a gold and 6 or more minutes every time you want to fly using a [[flight path]] to Dalaran, get this quest at level 74. When you talk to the following members of the Kirin Tor, they will port you to Dalaran:

{{gossip|''I am ready to be teleported to Dalaran.''}}

'''{{FactionIcon|Neutral|small}} [[Neutral]]'''
*[[Magister Teronus III]] ([[The Argent Stand]], [[Zul'Drak]])

'''{{FactionIcon|Alliance|small}} [[Alliance]]'''
*[[Baron Ulrik von Stromhearth]] ([[Valgarde]], [[Howling Fjord]])
*[[Image of Archmage Modera]] ([[Star's Rest]], [[Dragonblight]])
*[[Vas the Unstable]] ([[Wintergarde]], [[Dragonblight]])
*[[Magister Dath'omere]] ([[Valiance Keep]], [[Borean Tundra]])
*[[Magistrix Haelenai]] ([[Amberpine Lodge]], [[Grizzly Hills]])

The trick is to ''never'' complete the quest. As long as you have the quest, you will always have an instant port to Dalaran from the [[Borean Tundra]], [[Dragonblight]], [[Howling Fjord]], or [[Grizzly Hills]]. Once you complete this quest, you no longer get to take advantage of it.
