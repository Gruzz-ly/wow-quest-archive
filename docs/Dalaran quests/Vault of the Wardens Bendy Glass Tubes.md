==Objectives==
Bring the Bendy Glass Tubes to [[Deucus Valdera]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Bendy Glass Tubes]] (provided)

==Description==
You find tubing formed from a bendable sort of glass. It appears as though [[Grimoira]] was using it to suck out the insides of her victims.

Its magical properties, however, would seem ideal for use on an advanced alchemy table.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What's this you have for me, <name>? Say, these are some wondrous tubes! I bet I know a way to make them even better.

I'll need you to temper these glass tubes in the fire of a [[dragon]]'s breath under the light of a full [[moon]] on the equinox, then travel into the [[Emerald Dream]] and--

Oh, hold on. These tubes are perfect just as they are. Nevermind!

Sometimes I get a bit caught up in this whole adventuring business...

==Notes==
*You can find the quest item while on the [[Vault of the Wardens: Demon's Bile]] quest.

;On completion
