==Objectives==
Find Lyndras in [[Dalaran]].
* Find [[Lyndras]] Again

==Description==
Oh dear.

He had just promised you that he wouldn't wander off, and then he did it again!

I'm starting to think that this Lyndras character might be a bit too impetuous for my tastes.

Please, go find him, before he gets into any more trouble.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My most sincere apologies, <name>. Not only did I make a spectacle of myself, I fear I may have also put the good name of your [[Talismanic Textiles|tailoring shop]] at risk.

You have every right to be upset with me.

==Notes==
Head to the Legerdemain Lounge's second floor where [[Catriona Macrae]] is cowering in fear in the corridor.
:{{Text|yell|Catriona Macrae|OH GOD, WHAT IS THAT THING?! Someone, help! Please! It's tearing my room apart!}}
*{{Text|say|Lyndras|It's in here! I know it!}}
*{{Text|say|Lyndras|Just a taste, that's all I need! Just, one... little... TASTE!}}
*{{Text|say|Lyndras|Why won't this blasted cabinet open up!!}}

;Speaking with Lyndras
:Get away from me!

:{{Gossip|Lyndras, please, stop! Get a hold of yourself, man!}}
:{{Text|say|Lyndras|What?! Oh, it's you, <name>. I was just looking for something. My apologies. I'll return to the shop immediately.}}
:''Lyndras runs away.''
