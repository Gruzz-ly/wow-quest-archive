This quest is from finding or buying a [[Waterlogged Recipe]], which is rarely found within a [[Bag of Fishing Treasures (Dalaran)]].

==Objectives==
Bring the Waterlogged Recipe to [[Christi Stockton]] in [[Dalaran]] City.
*[[Waterlogged Recipe]] (provided)

==Description==
This appears to be the remains of a mixture for potent wine. Perhaps the proprietor of [[One More Glass]] in Dalaran would be interested in it....

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40|ea=5}}
*24254 [[XP]] (or {{cost|13|23}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Wine is only as fine as the person drinking it, I always say.

==Completion==
This is quite a find, <name>. I can't have you selling this to anyone else, so I'm willing to offer generously.

==Notes==
This item can be traded with other players.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=[[Dalaran Cooking Award]] replaced with [[Epicurean's Award]].}}
*{{Patch 3.2.0|note=Added. Players with 300 or higher [[cooking]] have a chance to find a Waterlogged Recipe in the [[Bag of Fishing Treasures (Dalaran)]] awarded by the [[Daily_quest#Fishing_quests|Northrend fishing dailies]]. This item can be traded to other players and rewards several [[Dalaran Cooking Award]]s when turned in.}}
