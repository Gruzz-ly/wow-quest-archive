==Objectives==
Return your ward to the [[Dalaran]] orphanage by handing in the Wolvar Orphan Whistle to [[Orphan Matron Aria]] in [[Dalaran]].
*[[Wolvar Orphan Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
Know what? You not so bad after all, <name>. You take Kekek a lot of fun places. Kekek meet a lot of new friends and do things no other pup get to do.

You, and [[Hemet Nesingwary]], and [[Snowfall Glade]] pups all new best friends. Maybe sometime you bring Kekek that [[Green Hills of Stranglethorn|green hills]] book? Kekek promise to write sometimes, too, tell you how things go. Maybe even be nice to [[Oracles|big-tongue]] kids sometimes.

Kekek gotta go back to orphan-lady Aria now, back in purple [[human]] city.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
* [[Pet Care Package]]

* [[Well-loved Figurine]]

You will also receive: [[Curious Wolvar Pup]] (by mail)

==Progress==
Kekek not want to go. Kekek want to see more of [[Northrend]] with <name>.

==Completion==
Thank you for agreeing to care for Kekek this week. I know he can be a handful, but I think that with more individual attention and a few friends, he'll do a lot better. No doubt he's going to be telling stories of his adventures with you for weeks.

==Notes==
Within a day of completing the for the first time quest, the player receives this letter:

{{Book|From Kekek|content=
Dear <name>,

Kekek not good at writing, but learn how just to write you letter. Orphan-lady found old copy of Green Hills book Hemet talked about. Been reading it, learning how to be great hunter like you and Hemet Nesingwary. Takes a lot of words to be good hunter, Kekek guess.

Kekek want to try out stuff he read about in Green Hills book. Maybe you let Kekek come visit and we can hunt together? Kekek promise not to kill steal.

Your friend,<br/>Kekek

Attached is a [[Curious Wolvar Pup]].
