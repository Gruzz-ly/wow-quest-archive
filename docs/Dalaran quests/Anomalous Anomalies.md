==Objectives==
Use [[Khadgar]]'s crystal to neutralize anomalies in [[Dalaran]].
*[[Unstable Anomaly]] Neutralized (4)
*[[Translocation Anomaly Neutralization Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
Dalaran's move to this location was intended to be a temporary measure, but we may need to depart sooner than expected.

[[Blink]]ing a city across the world is no mean feat. The magnitude of energies involved can lead to... unexpected side effects.

Arcane anomalies are causing mischief throughout the city. Their presence could destabilize any attempt to blink again.

We don't have time to let them dissipate on their own, <name>. I have a device that will help speed things along.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60}}
*14,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you neutralized the anomalies?

I really can't emphasize enough how important this is.

==Completion==
Good work. There are still some stray anomalies floating about, but you've negated enough interference that we should no longer be prevented from relocating the city.

Now we just need to determine our destination.

==Notes==
Don't mind the Burning Legion invasion going on. The [[Unstable Anomaly|unstable anomalies]] are marked on the minimap. Target one and use the quest item.

;Quest accept:
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|[[Archmage Modera]] and I will continue examining the tome we recovered from Karazhan. We WILL find those Pillars, <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Hmm... That gives me an idea... We'll discuss it when you've handled those anomalies.}}
