==Objectives==
Find Lyndras.
* Find [[Lyndras]]

==Description==
That's strange. Lyndras was here one moment, and then he ran off the next. He had such a strange look on his face.

Perhaps we should track him down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,620 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Sorry about that, <name>. You caught me snooping around. I suppose my curiosity got the better of me.

Allow me to make it up to you.

==Notes==
Head to the [[Underbelly]] and find Lyndras in [[Fizzi Liverzapper]]'s chamber.

;Speaking with Lyndras
:These potions are just delightful...

:{{Text|say|Lyndras|Err... I was just uh... looking for new dyes. Yes, that's it. New dyes. I'll return to the shop immediately.}}
