==Objectives==
Treat the wounds of [[Defender Barrem]].
*Defender Barrem Cured
*[[Purify Stone]] (provided)

==Description==
I thought Barrem was lost to us after the tragedy at [[Broken Shore]], [[Light]] knows we lost far too many good soldiers just like him there.

I was shocked to see he was still alive when one of our patrols arrived carrying him. They found him floating in the sea with wounds that would kill any lesser [[draenei]].

There is something about those wounds that resists everything we've done to treat them. Please, priest, as a brother in the Light I ask you to do all that you can to help him to recover.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Completion==
I... I owe you my life, <brother/sister>, but that look on your face tells me you're here for something else.

<You tell Barrem about his mentioning of [[T'uure, Beacon of the Naaru|T'uure]] in his sleep.>

I must have been dreaming of [[Alora]], she was my cell mate in that [[Niskara|accursed world]] the demons took me to. She told me she saw the crystal but never said much else.

I just hope she is still alive.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|He's just inside. Please, do whatever you can to save him.}}

Defender Barrem is lying on the central bed just inside [[First to Your Aid]].

:{{Text|say|Defender Barrem|T... T'uure... Alora... escape...}}

He is initially at around 46% health and has the "Felcursed Wounds" debuff, which negates all healing he receives. Upon using [[Purify]] or [[Mass Dispel]] to remove the debuff, the following occurs:
:{{text|emote|Defender Barrem writhes in agony.}}
:{{text|bossemote|The Fel Magic reacts violently to your spell!}}
This causes a [[Fel Tainted Blood]] to spawn next to you and begin attacking. When you kill it, Barrem wakes up.
:{{text|say|Defender Barrem|Oh, my head... where am I?}}
:{{text|say|Defender Barrem|I... I need fresh air!}}

Barrem then runs out of the building. Boros stands next to him.
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|Barrem!}}

==Progression==
{{Priest artifact and class hall}}
