==Objectives==
Recover the forgotten loot from the [[Lich King]] and find its intended recipient at the [[Steam Pools]] in [[Feralas]].
* Take the portal to the [[Frozen Throne]] {{co|38.7|40.2|Dalaran (Broken Isles)}}
* [[Invincible's Reins (quest item)|Forgotten Loot]] {{co|49.7|71.1|Icecrown Citadel|6}}
* [[Nexus-Lord Ashaal]] slain
* [[Johnny Awesome|Stalwart Adventurer]] located {{co|68.8|73.1|Feralas}}

==Description==
An adventurer of another time has forgotten to loot something big... something that might cause them great emotional strain if not received quickly.

Your destination is [[Icecrown Citadel]], your target the Lich King's corpse. Retrieve the missing item post-haste and deliver it to the stalwart adventurer - he should be somewhere at the Steam Pools in Feralas.

My assistant will open a portal to deliver you there. Just a moment!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hold, peasant. What business have you with the illustrious Johnny Awesome?

==Completion==
You'd best carry a reason of a higher caliber than that to dare interrupt my time with these buxom beauties.

==Notes==
;Quest accept
:{{text|say|[[Katy Stampwhistle]]|One portal, coming up!}}
:''A [[Portal to the Frozen Throne]] appears.''
:{{text|say|Katy Stampwhistle|Voila!}}

The player will arrive atop [[Icecrown Citadel]] near the [[Frozen Throne]]. The Lich King lies dead near the throne itself.

;Approaching the corpse
: ''An ethereal appears and attacks, then another will spawn afterwards.''

Two types of stealthed [[ethereal]]s wander the Frozen Throne area.

[[Covetous Hoarder]]
* {{text|say|Can't I just have it?}}
* {{text|say|Do you know how long I've been waiting for this?}}
* {{text|say|I won't lose again! It's mine!}}

[[Dastardly Thief]]
* {{text|say|Dibs. Dibs! I called dibs!}}
* {{text|say|You don't understand - I need this!}}
* {{text|say|I saw it first!}}

;Looting [[Invincible's Reins (quest item)]]
: ''A void portal appears and Nexus-Lord Ashaal comes through it. If you don't back out of range right away he will attack.''
: {{text|say|Nexus-Lord Ashaal|My, my, what do we have here?}}

;Aggro
: {{text|say|Nexus-Lord Ashaal|Meddling where we shouldn't, I see. Understandable.}}

;During fight
: {{text|say|Nexus-Lord Ashaal|How did you know we were here, I wonder?}}
: {{text|say|Nexus-Lord Ashaal|You mortals are all the same. Fighting, but not knowing what for.}}

;Death
: {{text|say|Nexus-Lord Ashaal|Pity. You would have made an excellent servant.}}

There's no quest shortcut to Feralas. Consider the Earthshrine portals to [[Uldum]].

;Arriving at Johnny
:{{text|say|[[Johnny Awesome]]|I'm the elf your elf could be, if he was me.}}

Johnny is sitting in a beach chair, his steed [[Spooky]] at his side, and surrounded by five [[Resort Guest]]s.
