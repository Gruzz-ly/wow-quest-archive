==Objectives==
Speak to [[Lalla Brightweave]] in [[Dalaran]], and ask her to summon [[Lyndras]].
* Speak with Lalla Brightweave

==Description==
Might I ask a favor, <name>?

As I am recently without a home, shop, family, or friends, I was wondering if you might show me your floating city? I must admit, I am VERY curious about the place. I've also heard good things about their tailoring shop.

I have no way of getting there myself, but certainly such a magical city has SOMEONE who can summon me.

<Lyndras looks at you with hopeful apprehension.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find a tailor yet?

==Completion==
Your friend certainly has an... interesting appearance.

He taught you to sew this silk? Hmm. Maybe we should keep him around for a while.
