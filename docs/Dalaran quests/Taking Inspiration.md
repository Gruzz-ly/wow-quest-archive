==Objectives==
Obtain 6 Runed Breeches.
* [[Runed Breeches]] (6)

==Description==
I wish I had more patterns to share, but my notebook was lost along with my shop. We'll need to come up with some patterns on our own.

I've been thinking about the leather breeches that the [[Stormheim]] [[vrykul]] wear. They're certainly much thicker and heavier than anything we could sew, but their embellishing runework is quite impressive.

If I had a few pairs, perhaps I could re-imagine this runework on a more... refined garment.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*[[Silkweave Pantaloons]]

You will receive:
* 15,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm looking forward to this.

==Completion==
Aha! This will be much simpler than I'd first thought.

<[[Lyndras]] takes a moment to jot some instructions down on a scrap of [[vellum]].>

Here, <name>. You should have it.
