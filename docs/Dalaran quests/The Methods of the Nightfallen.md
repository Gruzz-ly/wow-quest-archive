==Objectives==
Obtain an Ancient Sentry Construct Memory Core.
* [[Ancient Sentry Construct Memory Core (drop)]]

==Description==
I have a theory, <name>.

Have you encountered the [[nightfallen]] [[elves]] of [[Azsuna]]? They descend from the [[Highborne]], and the accomplishments of Highborne smiths are legendary.

These fallen elves do a bit of [[arcane]] tinkering, crafting sentries to patrol their camps.

Bring me a memory core from one of their constructs. Who knows what manner of [[smith]]lore might lie within!

==Rewards==
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hopefully we can extract something useful.

==Completion==
If my guess is correct, the answer to our welding problem lies within this core.
