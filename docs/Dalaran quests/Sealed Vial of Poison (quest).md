==Objectives==
Bring the Seal Vial of Poison to [[Alchemist Cinesra]] in the [[Underbelly|Dalaran Sewers]].
* [[Sealed Vial of Poison]] (provided)

==Description==
This vial of poison looks particularly dangerous. Perhaps someone in [[Dalaran]] might be interested in it. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}} ({{cost|14|80}} at max level)
+325 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor]]

==Progress==
Is that what I think it is, <class>?

==Completion==
You are brave to have carried this.  If even one drop were to touch your skin, you'd have died an agonizing death.

Allow me to pay you for it... I can always use venom of exceptional potency.

==Notes==
This quest is randomly available as a result of doing the Dalaran fishing daily quests.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.1|note=This quest no longer rewards experience.}}
*{{Patch 3.1.0|note=Added.}}
