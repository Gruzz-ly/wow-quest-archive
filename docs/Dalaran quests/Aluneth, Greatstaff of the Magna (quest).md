==Objectives==
Meet [[Kalecgos|Kalec]] at the [[Violet Citadel]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Ancient Scrolls of Meitre]] x3 (provided)

==Description==
[[:Aluneth]]... a powerful and dangerous weapon. If tales are to be believed, Aluneth is actually the name of a very old and very powerful [[Aluneth (entity)|arcane entity]], somehow bound to a staff through ancient magic.

When [[Aegwynn]] relinquished Aluneth many years ago, it was entrusted to [[Kirin Tor]], who, fearing its unbridled power, handed it to the [[blue dragonflight]] to secure away in secret. Only they would know exactly where it was taken.

The dragon Kalec may be our best chance. He now resides on the [[Council of Six]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}
*1,500 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Completion==
So you seek Aluneth? A dangerous weapon, to be sure.

Long ago the Kirin Tor entrusted the blue dragonflight with its safekeeping. It was locked away in the only place that could contain its rampant power  - the [[Nexus Vault]].

I have not been there in some time, however. After the blue dragonflight was dissolved, the [[Nexus]] was all but abandoned. There is no knowing whether the Nexus Vault is still intact - or what may be waiting in the Nexus itself.

==Notes==
Use the portal to Dalaran in the eastern end of the room to travel to [[Krasus' Landing]], and then head to the Violet Citadel to speak with Kalec.

:{{text|say|Meryl Felstorm|Return here once you have retrieved the artifact, <name>. In the meantime, I'll see about tidying up a bit.}}
