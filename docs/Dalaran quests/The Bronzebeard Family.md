==Objectives==
Head to [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]] and [[Dagran Thaurissan II|Dagran]] in the [[Dalaran Visitor Center]] to inform them of what has happened to [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]].
*Talk to Brann

==Description==
<Moira takes a deep, centering breath.>

We need to let Brann and my son Dagran know what happened. They're at Dalaran's visitor center.

Could ye go get them for me? Father needs his family right now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
My son always has been the scholarly sort. Takes after his father in that way...

We're all quite proud of him.

==Completion==
It's good for us to all be in one room together, even if the reason is so dire. My father hasn't really been a... part of Dagran's life. But I mean to change that, you have my word.

Thank ye, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|You'll likely find Dagran with his nose in a book. It's why he insisted we come to Dalaran.}}

Moira has new gossip:
{{dialogue|Father... Da... What have you gotten yourself into this time? You can't leave us like this.

Please be alright, you old coot.

{{Gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Now listen, you old coot. I know you always meant right by me.}}
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|You didn't know that I chose to stay with the [[Dark Iron clan|Dark Irons]]. That [[Dagran Thaurissan|Dagran]] and I were in love.}}
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Whatever your intentions were, my husband died. Because of you.}}
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|I hated you for taking him from me. My anger built a wall neither of us could ever get through.}}
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|And now... we may never get the chance.}}
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|But my son--my little Dagran--he needs you. I guess so do I, loathe as I am to admit it.}}
:{{Text|say|Moira Thaurissan|You were never the best father. But you can still be a good gran'da. So please... wake up.}}

Head to the visitor center:
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|Have you seen these new tomes, Uncle Brann? They must be from [[Drenden]]'s library.}}

Dagran and Brann have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Dagran Thaurissan II|Oh! Hello there. Are you here to chat with Uncle Brann?

{{gossip|Tell me more about yourself.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Oh! Well, my ma is Moira Thaurissan and my da was Emperor Dagran Thaurissan. I'm named after him, see. That's why I'm the second.

Which I suppose makes me a prince, but I fancy myself more of a [[scholar]]. That's why I'm in Dalaran! I'm trying tae learn all I can about the world.}}}}
{{dialogue|title=Brann Bronzebeard|Hey there, champion! Dagran and I were just perusing the local books and whatnot. Lad couldn't be more excited for his first visit to Dalaran.

What brings ye here?

{{Gossip|quest=|Magni's hurt. Moira needs you both in the Portrait Room.}}}}
:''Dagran runs out.''
:{{Text|say|Dagran Thaurissan II|I hope Gran'da is all right. I never got to spend much time with him...}}
:{{Text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Don't worry, lad. Magni's made of stern stuff. Pardon the pun.}}
:''Brann follows suit.''

Return to the Portrait Room. Dagran and Brann have new gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Dagran Thaurissan II|Gran'da has been through way worse than this. I know he'll wake up soon. 

He has to...}}
{{dialogue|title=Brann Bronzebeard|Magni really mucked the bedroll with this one, didn't he? Couldn't leave well enough alone.

Well. I know that's not really his way. Not when the world is at stake.}}

During the [[Radiant Echoes]] event, the quest was followed by [[Memories of Adventures Past]]. After the launch of {{expac|The War Within}}, Magni gets up from bed upon turning in the quest.
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Father! Are you alright?}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Aye, lass. But I saw... a vision of destruction.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|And a name. [[Khaz Algar]].}}
