==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Fel Lord Nezmet.jpg|Fel Lord Nezmet|This [[lieutenant]] of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] is the key to breaking the Legion's resolve. Defeat him and we will be able to retake [[Dalaran]].}}
Kill Fel Lord Nezmet.
* Enter [[Violet Citadel]] (Optional)
* [[Fel Lord Nezmet]] slain

==Description==
Fel Lord Nezmet managed to slip through our [[teleportation]] spell and open cracks within our wards.

Left unopposed, Nezmet will widen those cracks until the wards fail and the full might of the Legion is brought down upon us.

We have a chance now, to finish him before he finishes us. Cut off their head and the rest of the Legion will wither and die.

Head to the Violet Citadel with all haste. There is not a moment to lose.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|46}}
*2,100 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Progress==
With Nezmet dead, Dalaran is saved.

==Completion==
We make a good team, <name>.

The [[Kirin Tor]] will handle the remaining Legion forces from here. For now my attention must turn to restoring the wards to their full strength.

==Notes==
