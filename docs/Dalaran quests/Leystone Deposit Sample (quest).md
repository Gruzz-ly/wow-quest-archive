==Objectives==
Bring the Leystone Deposit Sample to [[Mama Diggs]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Leystone Deposit Sample]] (provided)

==Description==
This ore looks like nothing you've seen before.

A mystical sheen moves through the metal in complex, unpredictable patterns. Your trainer in Dalaran would certainly like to see this.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining techniques#Legion|Mining Technique: Leystone Deposit (Rank 1)]]

You will also receive:
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's that you've got there, <boy/girl>?

==Completion==
It's so light. So pretty, too! Reminds me of [[elementium]], a bit.

If you see any more ore like this, try and strike it with the grain. You'll waste much less of it.
