'''Sew It Begins''' opens up 800 maximum skill for [[Tailoring]] and starts the profession's questlines in ''[[Legion]]''.

==Objectives==
Obtain 10 Shal'dorei Silk.  You can find Shal'dorei Silk on humanoids within the [[Broken Isles]], obtain some from a fellow [[adventurer]], or you may visit the [[Auction House]] and buy some.
* [[Shal'dorei Silk]] (10)

==Description==
Every time [[Dalaran]] takes us to a new shore, I get anxious over what types of fabric and cloth we might find below.

Threads imbued with [[magic]]?  Something [[demon]]ically-tinged?

Ugh, I hope it's not [[Sumptuous Fur|FURS]] again.

You're an adventurer... and tailor to boot.  Head on down there and see what you can scrounge up!

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*{{Abilities|Legion Tailoring|id=264629|icon=trade_tailoring}}

You will receive:
* 15,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I wouldn't mind working with some cashmere...

==Completion==
Now this... this I can work with!

Reminds me of some old [[Night elf|night elven]] festival cloth I've seen.

==Notes==
If you already happen to have ten silk, you will have to mail them to an alt and back again to make them count for the quest.
