==Objectives==
Return 9 Rejected Letters.
*Letters returned (9)

==Description==
You've arrived just in time!

Unlike the mail as of late, I'm afraid.

We are severely understaffed, and demand is at an all-time high. We simply can't keep up!

I'd love to chat, but I need help catching up before I can rest for even a moment.

First thing's first. Several parcels of rejected mail have broken loose again; will you help me round them all up and return them to their senders?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
*1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're an absolute natural!

Say, do you mind sticking around for awhile? I could sure use a helping hand!

==Notes==
To enter [[The Postmaster's Office]], go to {{Coords|33|32|Dalaran}} in [[Dalaran]] and enter the [[Mail Tube]].

;Quest accept
:{{text|say|[[The Postmaster]]|No need to track down the sender. The tubes will handle that!}}

The letters, like [[BAD HANDWRITING]], [[NOT ENOUGH STAMPS]], and [[NO ADDRESS]] are hovering around the mail room. Interact with them.
