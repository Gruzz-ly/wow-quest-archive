==Objectives==
Craft some Masterwork Silkweave Bracers.
* [[Masterwork Silkweave Bracers]]

==Description==
Okay, done mourning! Let's look through his stuff.

<Tanithria takes a moment to leaf through [[Lyndras]]' journal. Her eyes open wide.>

Our friend has been keeping secrets from us. Look at this! Every single one of the recipes he's taught us can be improved.

Let's start simple, with some bracers. I can supply most of the materials, but you'll have to talk to [[Alard Schmied]] in the [[Tanks for Everything|blacksmithing shop]] to get this powdered brimstone.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*{{Abilities|Advanced Silkweaving|id=186025|icon=trade_tailoring}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These patterns are fascinating. I never knew you could get this kind of result out of simple silks.

==Completion==
The good news is that we can now craft more efficient patterns out of silkweave.

The bad news is that we've expended the remainder of Lyndras' knowledge. Where should we turn next?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Tanithria|You should start by filling the dyeing tub. Green dye's on the shelf, but you'll have to get the brimstone shavings from Alard Schmied in the blacksmithing shop.}}

The player learns how to create [[Silkweave Bracer: Outer Layer]], [[Silkweave Bracer Lining]], and [[Masterwork Silkweave Bracers]]. Gather necessary items from the shop. For [[Alard's Brimstone Shavings]], speak with Alard:
:{{Gossip|Tanithria at the tailoring shop needs some brimstone shavings for a pattern.}}
:{{Text|say|Alard Schmied|Brimstone? What could she possibly want THAT for? Gah, tailors. Here you go.}}

Use it on the [[Tanithria's Dyeing Tub]]:
:{{Gossip|Fill the tub with green dye and brimstone shavings.}}

Interact with the tub again:
:<This is a tub suitable for dyeing fabric. The pattern you are working on requires a combination of green dye and brimstone shavings.>

:{{Gossip|Dye the silkweave.}}
