==Objectives==
Assist the [[nightfallen]] of [[Suramar]] until you discover a way to move safely amongst the [[Nightborne|elves]] of [[Suramar City]].

==Description==
I recall [[Lyndras]] mentioning a guild of tailors within Suramar City. Perhaps they could further our understanding of how to utilize this new cloth.

Unfortunately from what I've heard, they've sided with the [[demon]]s and anyone opposed to them is to be killed on sight.

You must find a way to move safely within the confines of their city if we're to continue our research.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=1000|Ancient Mana
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...

==Completion==
Now that you can move safely around the city, it's time to find some new masters.
