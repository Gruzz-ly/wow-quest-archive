==Objectives==
Send civilians to the landing for safety.
* Citizens saved (10)
* [[Nerubian]]s slain (0/100%)
*Talk to Alleria at [[Krasus' Landing|Krasus Landing]].

==Description==
As much as I'd love to hunt [[Xal'atath]] down, our first priority must be securing civilians. 

Rescue whoever you can and tell them to head to the landing nearby. I'll find [[mage]]s to teleport everyone to safety.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That's the first group evacuated. But we're not done yet.

==Notes==
[[File:Breach - Aerith Primrose.jpg|thumb|A reference, perhaps?]]

On accept:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|[[Dalaran]] will not be a fly in Xal'atath's web.}}
:''She runs off.''

Rescue any 10 of the following: [[Mei Francis]], [[Glutonia]], [[Aerith Primrose]], [[Imindril Spearsong]], [[Lianna Tai (NPC)|Lianna Tai]], [[Lucian Trias]], [[Kizi Copperclip]], [[Dariness the Learned]], [[Tanithria]], [[Afsaneh Asrar]], [[Thanid Glowergold]], [[Professor Pallin]], [[Sabriana Sorrowgaze]], [[Halga Steelbarrow]], [[Amisi Azuregaze]], [[Timothy Jones]], [[Tassia Whisperglen]], [[Kondal Huntsworn]], [[Teller Rames]], [[Ol' Toomba]], [[Hunaka Greenhoof]], [[Namha Moonwater]], [[Fialla Sweetberry]], [[Whirt the All-Knowing]], [[Olisarra the Kind]], [[Hobart Grapplehammer]], [[Deucus Valdera]], [[Sandra Bartan]], [[Li-An Skymirror]].

Fill the bar by killing [[Pestilent Drone]]s (+1%), [[Small Threadling]]s (+1%), [[Drone Abductor]]s (+4%), [[Rampaging Threadling]]s (+4%), [[Drone Bomber]]s, [[Nerubian War-Weaver]]s (+8%), and [[Nerubian Venomspitter]]s (+8%).

Several citizens did not survive the teleport and/or attack, including [[Jang Quillpaw]], [[Edward Egan]], [[Angelique Butler]], [[Tiffany Cartier]], [[Lalla Brightweave]], [[Ranid Glowergold]], [[Linzy Blackbolt]], [[Mongar]], [[Mama Diggs]], [[Arille Azuregaze]], [[Catriona Macrae]], [[Teller Hoag]], and a [[Crimson Pilgrim]].

While moving through the city, [[Elizabeth Ross]] can be seen fleeing, before getting grabbed by a Drone Abductor. Similarly, [[Bonegrim]] is attacked by a Nerubian Venomspitter, but it will abduct him when approached.

Some civilians have dialogue when saved.

*{{text|say|Lianna Tai|Looks like I needed an exterminator after all. My thanks!}}
*{{Text|Say|Fialla Sweetberry|We never should have come here!}}
*{{Text|Say|Aerith Primrose|Phew. That was a close one.}}

When the objectives are dealt with, head to [[Krasus' Landing]]. All the saved NPCs, and [[Koraud]], can be found standing around [[Archmage Celindra]].

On complete, Celindra teleports the evacuees away.
