==Objectives==
{{npc||Archmage Celindra}} at [[The Violet Gate]] in [[Dalaran]] wants you to use the Teleport to Violet Stand Crystal and the Teleport to Dalaran Crystal.
* [[Teleport to Violet Stand Crystal]] used
* [[Teleport to Dalaran Crystal]] used

==Description==
Just in case you didn't already know, you can use the crystal on the platform behind me to teleport to the ruins in [[Crystalsong Forest]] beneath Dalaran.

Correspondingly, you can use the crystal in the ruins below to return to the chamber above me.

I would like for you to do this now.

==Progress==
I sense that you haven't yet tested out both of the teleport crystals.

That's alright, take your time.

==Completion==
Excellent, <class>.  Now you know the way to get down to Crystalsong Forest and also how to return.

==Notes==
* It resembles a piece of the triforce from the Legend of Zelda.
* Though the optional prequest that allows you go get to Dalaran once requires level 74, the quest in Dalaran itself can be done before that (confirmed at level 68), providing you can get to the questgiver without doing the prequest. The prequest will no longer be available if this quest is done first.
