==Objectives==
Accept a gryphon ride to [[Dalaran]] and speak with [[Isirami Fairwind]] at [[A Hero's Welcome]].

==Description==
Welcome to [[Northrend]], <name>.  I have been asked to arrange travel for you to Dalaran so that you can meet with our allies there.

Ride the gryphon to Dalaran and once you land, make your way to our inn there, A Hero's Welcome.  Find Isirami Fairwind and speak with her immediately.

She can help you bind your [[:hearthstone]] to the city so you can use the [[Silver Enclave]]'s portal to travel back to [[Stormwind]] quickly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|780}}
*1250 XP (or {{coppercost|780}} at max level)
*+10 [[reputation]] with the [[Silver Covenant]]

==Completion==
Welcome to Dalaran!  This inn is part of the Silver Enclave, the headquarters of the official Alliance presence in our city.

Don't forget to bind your hearthstone here for easy travel to the city and access to the portal to Stormwind next door. 

==Notes==
Can be accepted at either [[Valgarde]] or [[Valiance Keep]].
