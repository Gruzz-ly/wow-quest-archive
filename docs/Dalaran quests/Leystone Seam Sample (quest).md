==Objectives==
Bring the Leystone Seam Sample to [[Mama Diggs]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Leystone Seam Sample]] (provided)

==Description==
This ore has clearly absorbed some of the latent [[Ley line|ley energies]] within the [[Broken Isles]]. It is cool to the touch, and reflects light in odd, playful angles.

Your trainer in Dalaran should analyze this.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Mining_techniques#Legion|Mining Technique: Leystone Seam (Rank 1)]]

You will also receive:
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What've ye brought me now?

==Completion==
Look at that! She's a lovely one, isn't she?

Treat this type of ore with care, lad. No fat-muscle shoulder swings necessary - just a gentle tap on the right spot and you'll extract much more ore than a beginner.
