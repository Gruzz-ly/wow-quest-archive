== Objectives ==
Kill [[Instructor Razuvious]].

This quest can be completed with any difficulty or size raid.
* [[Instructor Razuvious]] slain 

== Description ==
Instructor Razuvious smugly struts about the [[Military Quarter]] of [[Naxxramas]].  It is said that only a [[death knight]] personally trained by him could possibly even withstand the prowess of his blade.

You and your group are going to prove everyone wrong.

The [[Council of Six]] has decreed that Razuvious must die! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|33|20}}
*+125 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor]]

== Progress ==
Is Razuvious dead?  I think not.

== Completion ==
Well done, <class>.  The [[Scourge]] military command out of Naxxramas has been thrown into disarray by Razuvious's demise.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.3.0|note=Added.}}
