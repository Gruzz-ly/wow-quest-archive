'''Blood On Your Hands''' is a bread crumb quest to introduce players to [[Illnea Bloodthorn]].

==Completion==
Around the [[Broken Isles|isles]], the very blood of our [[Sargeras|enemy]] attempts to corrupt all things. But as you may already know, this blood can be extracted.

We [[demon hunter]]s use this blood for our own rituals, fueling us to fight back the demon invasion.

Bring me any [[Blood of Sargeras]] you find and I will trade with you what I can.
