==Objectives==
Bring the Leysmithing Guide to [[Alard Schmied]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Leysmithing Guide]] (Provided)

==Description==
I could spend hours poring over the details of this fascinating manuscript!

...is what I would say if this weren't the simplest of tasks for someone of my skill level. It's about something called "Leysmithing". Here.

<The [[gnome]] scribbles down a translation on the back of the scroll.>

There it is, word-for-word. Bring me something interesting next time.

==Rewards==
* 1,530 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the [[engineering]] shop?

==Completion==
I hadn't even thought far enough ahead to realize you'd need this to be translated, too. Good thinking.

See, this is why I keep [[adventurer]]s like you around the shop.
