==Objectives==
Speak with [[Kuhuine Tenderstride]] about the quick-reproducing property of [[:aethril]].

==Description==
As you harvest the aethril, your hand brushes the flower's pollinating organs against one another, creating a reaction.

You may have discovered a new herbalism technique. Your trainer in [[Dalaran]] would be a good person to discuss this with.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Legion|Herbalism Technique: Aethril (Rank 3)]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Kuhuine listens to your story about the aethril.>

What you're saying rings true, <name>. I have heard tales of herbalists that could coax flowers into quickly reproducing, but I was never able to master the technique myself.

Well done, herbalist. I feel great pride.
