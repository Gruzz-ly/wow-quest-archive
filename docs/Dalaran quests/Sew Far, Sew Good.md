==Objectives==
Craft a Silkweave Bag. You will need to gather materials inside the [[Dalaran]] [[Talismanic Textiles|tailoring shop]].
* [[Handcrafted Silkweave Bag]]

==Description==
Your tailoring skill really is impressive and, although I don't have my patterns with me, I do have some patterns memorized. One of those patterns is for a simple bag.

Follow my lead, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*[[Silkweave Satchel]]

You will receive:
* 15,620 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There's nothing quite like a new bag.

==Completion==
There you have it. Not the best bag in the world, but it's better than most.

I want to apologize again for running off, <name>. My hunger... err, curiosity... occasionally gets the better of me. I promise it will not happen again.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|[[Lalla Brightweave]]|Oh, <name>, I have some Spritethorns for sale if you need any for your bag recipe.}}

Loot [[Tanithria's Blue Dye]] and use Lalla's offer to restock.

Upon completion, Lyndras runs away again.
