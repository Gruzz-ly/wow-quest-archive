==Objectives==
Meet [[Khadgar]] in [[Dalaran]] at its new location above [[Deadwind Pass]].
* Take the Portal to Dalaran over Karazhan in the [[Cleft of Shadow]]
* Speak to Archmage Khadgar in Dalaran {{co|31.5|43.8|Dalaran}}
* Have Khadgar address the [[Council of Six]] {{co|30.7|48.9|Dalaran}}

==Description==
<The arcane anomaly addresses you in Khadgar's voice.>

Though I am loathe to interrupt your fight against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]], I must request your help in a matter of... diplomacy. We face a grave threat, and we require the full might of [[Azeroth]]'s people to overcome it.

The Horde must become part of the [[Kirin Tor]] once again. Some will not agree with this position.

Please join me outside the [[Violet Citadel]] in [[Dalaran]]. We have repositioned the city to defend the [[Eastern Kingdoms]], above [[Karazhan]].

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|9|70}}

==Completion==
[[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]]'s reaction was unfortunate, but not unexpected. She has endured so much...

Though it was [[Garrosh Hellscream]] who ordered the obliteration of [[Theramore Isle|Theramore]], the only thing she can think of when she looks at you, or any Horde, is her desire for vengeance. I hope one day she can overcome that hatred.

Enough ruminating. We must prepare the Kirin Tor for war.

==Notes==
This quest becomes available upon completing the [[Battle for the Broken Shore]] storyline, ending with [[Keep Your Friends Close]], or, for [[demon hunter]]s, their [[Demon hunter starting experience|starting experience]], ending with [[A Weapon of the Horde]].

On accept:
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Greetings, <name>. Word has reached me of your efforts to push back against [[Legion Invasion|Legion invasion forces]].}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I am reluctant to interrupt such important work, but I could use your help in a matter of... diplomacy. I fear I am about to anger an old friend.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Dalaran has been repositioned to defend the Eastern Kingdoms. You'll find it over Deadwind Pass, just above Karazhan. Please join me here.}}

Don't go to [[Northrend]]. Don't go to the [[Broken Isles]]. Head to [[Cleft of Shadow]], where there will be a portal to a special phased version of Dalaran floating over Karazhan.

The Dalaran above Karazhan is nearly useless as a capital city, as all of the NPCs are complaining about the abrupt move and will not perform their usual functions - auctions, training, vendors, etc.

Khadgar is just outside the [[Violet Citadel]] at {{co|31.5|43.8|Dalaran}} on the Dalaran map, and {{co|41.6|73.2|Deadwind Pass}} on the [[Deadwind Pass]] map. Speak with him:
:How was the flight in? Seems we moved Dalaran from one dark, gloomy land to another.
:At least it's warmer here. And I must admit, being so close to Karazhan brings back many memories.
''{{gossip|How can I help, Archmage?}}''
: ''Khadgar walks toward the entrance of the Violet Citadel.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|The Legion's attacks will only intensify. We must do whatever is necessary to bolster our strength.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I will propose that we invite the [[Horde]] back into the [[Kirin Tor]]. To certain colleagues on the Council, this will be... controversial.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Your presence is a testimony to the valor of the Horde. To some... that may not be enough.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|The [[Council of Six|Council]] is already assembled. Let's not keep them waiting.}}

Inside the Violet Citadel, [[Archmage Karlain]], [[Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver]], [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Archmage Modera]], and [[Archmage Vargoth]] are standing around. Speak with Khadgar again:
:This could be uncomfortable. Are you ready, <name>?
''{{gossip|Address the Council, Khadgar.}}''

:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Thank you all for gathering on such short notice.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Khadgar, we don't have time to waste in meetings. The Legion is advancing and the Horde arms for battle.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Then I'll get right to the point. For the Kirin Tor to fight at full strength, we need the mages of the Horde to join our ranks.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|NEVER! Do you hear me, Khadgar?}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Jaina, we know the pain you've endured. But this is about--}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|They obliterated Theramore. They left us to die on the Broken Shore. Again and again they've proven to be monsters... cowards!}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I've made my case. With respect, I move for a vote.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Very well. But consider your choice carefully. If you let those vermin back into this city, I will not be counted among your ranks when you welcome them.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|In the matter of allowing the Horde into Dalaran and offering membership in the Kirin Tor, I vote aye.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Karlain|Aye.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Vargoth|Aye.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Nay.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver|Nay.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Modera|Aye.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|The vote carries. I'm sorry, Jaina, but the stakes are higher than they've ever been.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Modera|Jaina, please... we are doing what's best for [[Azeroth]]. Stand with us!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|This Council is blind to the truth. When the Horde betrays you again, remember who warned you. Farewell.}}
:''Jaina teleports away, and Khadgar walks over to take her place.''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|That was... difficult. But we must move forward. We will send our invitation to the Warchief at once. We have a war to win.}}

On complete:
: ''[[Brann Bronzebeard]] runs into the building, stopping briefly when he sees that the two he's looking for are present.''
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|<Name>! Khadgar! Thank the Forge I found ye! Ye won't believe it! Me brother [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]]'s back!}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Brann Bronzebeard!? Well, this is unexpected.}}

Brann offers the next quest, [[The Diamond King]].
