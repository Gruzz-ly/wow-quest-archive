==Objectives==
Go to the [[Eye of Azshara (instance)|Eye of Azshara]], defeat the [[Wrath of Azshara]] and recover the [[:Heart of the Storm]].
* [[Heart of the Storm]]

==Description==
In order to craft the gloves, we'll require a special item. This will be no easy task to recover it, <name>.

The [[naga]] of [[Azsuna]] are said to be hard at work trying to summon a terrible creature into [[Azeroth|this world]].

The creature's heart holds immense energy that we can use to channel into the gloves, making them incredibly powerful.

I need... I mean, we need that heart if we are to produce a suitable pair of gloves for someone of your presence.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*{{Abilities|Silkweave Gloves|id=186022|icon=trade_tailoring}}

You will also receive:
* 16,170 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What were you able to find?

==Completion==
[[Lyndras]] ran off again before you could return, <name>. He left a note and a pattern for you.

The note reads,

"I'm sorry, <name>, but I'm afraid I may become a threat to the fellow tailors of [[Talismanic Textiles|this shop]]. I'm off to find somewhere to try and control my urges, or fall into depravity. It has been an honor training you.

Sincerely,

Lyndras"

How sad...
