==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ildine Sorrowspear]] inside the enchanting shop in [[Dalaran]].

==Description==
Welcome! It's nice to see familiar faces returning to Dalaran. You might remember Ildine, [[Vanessa Sellers|Vanessa]], and me from Northrend. 

[[Archmage Aranhir Starsinger|Archmage Starsinger]] is in charge of the shop, but he's away on [[Kirin Tor]] business at the moment. He's a fine fellow... mostly.

Your arrival is fortunate. We've run into a problem that we'd love to solve before the archmage returns. Interested in lending a hand?

==Rewards==
You will learn: Legion Enchanting

You will also receive:
*{{cost||56|}}
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm relieved you've come, <name>. We could certainly use another enchanter in the shop at a time like this.
