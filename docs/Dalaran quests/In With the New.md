==Objectives==
Bring the newly forged [[:High-Capacity Decoction Conduit]] to [[Deucus Valdera|Deucus]] in [[Dalaran]].

==Description==
Well, here's your new conduit. Try not to break this one, I really don't feel like making another.

Oh, and tell your boss, Deucus, that he owes me big time for this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You're finished? Let's see it!

<Deucus takes the conduit from you and places it against the wall.>

Now that is a good looking decoction conduit. I'm glad I upgraded its strength from [[Broken High-Capacity Decoction Conduit|that old hunk of junk]] I had before.

You might even say [[Svena the Infused|Svena]] did me a favor by destroying that old one.

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{Text|say|Deucus Valdera|Oh, that reminds me. While you were off doing the easy work, I was out taking care of the other part that was needed.}}
:{{Text|say|Deucus Valdera|I had to deal with those awful scribes over at The [[Scribe's Sacellum]]. But, ultimately, it was worth the effort.}}
:{{Text|say|Deucus Valdera|That should do it. I think we both deserve a pat on the back, <name>. Wouldn't you agree?}}
:{{Text|say|Deucus Valdera|You should talk to [[Patricia Egan|Patricia]]. I believe she can offer you a new recipe.}}
