==Objectives==
Observe Alard as he attempts to work with the [[leystone]] ore.
* Observe Alard's Work

==Description==
I've never seen anything like this "leystone" ore. It's light, like [[mithril]], but it carries much more of a magical energy... more even than [[saronite]] or [[elementium]].

Let's try making something with it. How about a nice pair of gauntlets?

==Rewards==
You will learn:
*{{Abilities|Introduction to Leystone Smithing|Learn to craft the following items: [[Leystone Armguards]], [[Leystone Waistguard]]|id=191237|icon=trade_blacksmithing}}

==Completion==
Are you alright? Most of my stock seems to be unharmed by the flames. It's a good thing this wasn't the tailoring shop.

The explosion seemed to happen when I applied the flux.

No flux means no welding. That's a shame. Without the ability to weld, we're limited to crafting belts and bracers.

==Notes== 
;On accept
:{{text|say|Alard Schmid|Alright, let's see what we can do with this ore. First things first: we heat the ore.}}
:''Alard takes the ore to the smelter and heats it.''
:{{text|say|Alard Schmied|Now let's see what we can make with it.}}
:''Alard returns to the anvil and starts to work.''
:{{text|say|Alard Schmied|Shaping the ore...}}
:{{text|say|Alard Schmied|Look how easily it bends...}}
:{{text|say|And now for the simple step of applying the flux. Lean in closely and watch my technique.}}
:''As Alard begins applying the flux, the scene cuts to the exterior of the shop. An explosion blasts from both entrances, shaking the area and knocking [[Braeg Stoutbeard]] off his feet.'' 
:''Back inside, Alard is dazed and blackened by the explosion.''

;Speak to Alard again
:<Coughing rather vigorously>

:Well that was unexpected! You alright, <name>?
