==Objectives==
Talk to [[Eternus]] at the [[Infinite Bazaar]] in [[Dalaran]] once you have embraced your own legend.
*Reach Level 40
*Infinite Research assignments completed (2)
*Speak with Eternus

==Description==
I will keep a close eye on your progress and watch your exploits with that artifact unfold with great interest.

Once you have embraced the power of your own legend, I would like to hear your perspective on how important the artifact you wield has been on your journey.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||20}}
*2,150 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Progress==
We are on a journey of learning and discovery. Let us walk it together.

==Completion==
You have grown stronger, but your artifact is stronger yet.

It would appear that my hypothesis holds true--artifacts appear to be the key to protecting [[Azeroth]].

==Notes==
Speak with [[Eternus]].
{{Dialogue|
Time is as varied as it is infinite.

{{Dialogue-child|
Your effort in our experiments have been most helpful, <name>.

But tell me. What have you learned?

*{{gossip|quest=|The artifacts are strong, but, in time, I will be stronger.}}}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Give it time, <name>. Much more we will learn in time.

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
