==Objectives==
Create a [[:Reaves Module: Snack Distribution Mode]]. Then summon [[Reaves]] and install it into him.
*Create a Reaves Module: Snack Distribution Mode (Optional)
*Summon Reaves and apply the module

==Description==
Now that we got this baby running, let's give it some cool abilities.

When I was fixing Reaves up, I installed a module port onto his motherboard. This will allow us to upload anything we want.

I'll teach you one of my module designs and you install it on Reaves.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Schematics: Reaves Module: Repair Mode]]

==Progress==
I have a lot of other ideas for things we can do, but I only wrote down couple to start.

==Completion==
Everything appears to be running as expected. Although to be honest, I half expected an explosion to go along with it.

Here's the other schematic I made for Reaves. It's based off the auto-hammer design I gave you earlier.
