==Progress==
Four times the cost of the first for only one seal. Remember, I still offer more efficient options, but I never refuse someone who is insistent on paying me more. I leave you the choice.

Remember, you can only obtain three seals per week. This counts as one of those three. Next week, I will have others.
* Collect: [[Order Resources]] (4000)

==Completion==
Feeling safe, stranger?

==Rewards==
You will receive: [[Seal of Broken Fate]]

==Notes==
Players may acquire THREE Seals of Broken Fate every week, and this weekly quest counts as one of those three acquisitions. It is cheapest overall to spread out the acquisitions over the two different currencies, [[Order Resources]] and Gold, as acquiring an additional seal with the same currency will cost double the amount.
