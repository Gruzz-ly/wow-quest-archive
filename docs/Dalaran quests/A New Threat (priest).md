==Objectives==
Search the [[Azure Dragonshrine]] for clues regarding the current state of the [[Nexus]].
*Take the [[Dalaran]] portal to [[Wyrmrest Temple]] (Optional)
*Travel to the Azure Dragonshrine
*Clues Found (3)
*[[Kalec's Image Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
If you seek the Nexus, I would warn not to rush headlong. There are strange happenings in [[Coldarra]], and it would be best to gather some information before proceeding.

During my last visit to the [[Dragonblight]], I sensed unusual energies from the Azure Dragonshrine. Since this place was very closely tied to [[Malygos]]' plans during the [[Nexus War]]s, whatever is present there may explain the current state of the Nexus.

I cannot accompany you, but this crystal can be used to communicate with me. Good luck.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Progress==
The communication device is inactive.

==Completion==
This appears to be a communication device commonly utilized by the [[ethereal]]s.

Perhaps it could be the key to finding out who is behind the happenings at the Dragonshrine.

==Notes==
The quickest way to the Azure Dragonshrine is, as the quest objectives point out, the portal in the [[Portrait Room]], which is reached by standing in the central teleporter in the [[Chamber of the Guardian]]. In Dragonblight, low-level characters have access to the Summon Dragon Flight extra action button that summons [[Wyrmrest Temple Drake]] as a mount (vehicle).

At the Azure Dragonshrine, the forces of the [[blue dragonflight]] have been slaughtered, and [[Seething Void]]s move about the area.

Upon interacting with clues in the area, the [[Image of Kalec]] briefly appears and explains their significance.

[[Strange Portal]]:
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|This portal is very similar to ones used by the ethereals in [[Outland]].}}
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|Could they be the threat? What did Malygos promise them?}}

[[Void Siphon]]:
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|This device appears to draw upon the [[void]] energy released when Malygos forced [[Azeroth]]'s [[ley line]]s into the [[Twisting Nether]].}}
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|The design looks very familiar...}}

[[Void-Tainted Blade]]:
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|This weapon has been infused with dark energies from the Twisting Nether.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|Whoever wielded it must be seeking to harness void energy. But for what purpose?}}

After interacting with all three types of clues, head to the southeastern corner of the Dragonshrine to find the [[Ethereal Communication Device]].
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|Yet more evidence of ethereal technology. This may be an unfortunate turn.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Kalec|There's only one way to find out who's really behind this.}}

==Progression==
{{Priest artifact and class hall}}
