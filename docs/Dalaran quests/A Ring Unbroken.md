==Objectives==
Aid the shaman of the [[Earthen Ring]] at the [[Maelstrom]]. [[Stormcaller Mylra]] will fly you there from [[Krasus' Landing]] in [[Dalaran]].
* Fly to the Maelstrom with Mylra
* Aid Shaman at the Maelstrom

==Description==
Our defeat at the Broken Shore was decisive. The [[Burning Legion]] has a foothold on [[Azeroth]], and the best of our armies are retreating in tatters.

The elders of the Earthen Ring have called an emergency council near the heart of our world - the Maelstrom. <name>, your triumphs throughout Azeroth and {{Au|Draenor}} are the stuff of legend. We need you more than ever.

Join me at the Maelstrom. Stormcaller Mylra will be flying there shortly - find her at Krasus' Landing here in Dalaran.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,050 [[XP]]
*{{cost|15|40}}

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. You saved me. You saved us all.

I was... outmatched. My relationship with the elements has changed since the events on Draenor. I have some soul-searching to do. <name>, you must carry the Earthen Ring forward without me. You are the leader they need.

==Notes==
As you walk around [[Dalaran]] over the [[Broken Isles]], [[Whispering Winds]] will spawn.
:{{text|say|Whispering Winds|<Name>! I found you! The four winds have been sent to seek you out. Come with me.}}
:{{text|emote|Whispering Winds gestures toward Thrall.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Shaman! I have an urgent message.}}
Thrall then offers this quest. Upon getting to Krasus' Landing:
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|Over here, shaman! We've no time to lose.}}
Interact with [[Stormbeak]] to continue.
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|It's a massacre out there. All around the world, our forces fall back.}}
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|Unless we find a way to turn this around, Azeroth will fall!}}
Upon getting to the Maelstrom:
:{{text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|The greatest shaman in the world are gathering below. What's left of 'em, that is.}}
Thrall and the rest of the Earthen Ring are gathered.
:{{text|say|Thrall|Yes, we must strike back. But how?}}
:{{text|say|[[Farseer Nobundo]]|We need weapons capable of overcoming the Legion.}}

===Stage 1: A Ring Unbroken===
:''Speak with Nobundo.''
* Speak with Nobundo.
Speak with Nobundo:
{{Dialogue|
Greetings, <name>. I am pleased you received Thrall's summons.

You can see, there are no factions here. We few are all that remain of the Earthen Ring, and we must struggle together or surely we will perish alone.

Survivors continue to make their way here from the four corners of Azeroth. See that their wounds are tended to. They need hope if they are to rejoin the fight, <name>. You must inspire them!

{{gossip|I will see to the others, Farseer.}}

:''Help the scattered shaman.''

:{{text|say|[[Tribemother Torra]]|What kind of a shaman can't light a fire?}}
:{{text|say|[[Bath'rah the Windwatcher]]|Shush, you! Dis wood be wet and me hands be shakin'.}}
Interact with the [[Damp Campfire]] to light it with [[Flame Shock]].
:{{text|say|Tribemother Torra|The Legion destroys us in the open fields. Even [[Thunder Bluff]] isn't safe from the [[Infernal]]s.}}
:''[[Gotura Fourwinds]] cheers and starts warming his hands above the fire.''
Helping Rehgar and Erunak:
:{{text|say|[[Rehgar Earthfury]]|This thing has sat useless for ten thousand years.}}
:{{text|say|[[Erunak Stonespeaker]]|It just needs a little... boost. Shaman, can you help?}}
Interact with the [[Maelstrom Pillar]] to power it with [[Lightning Bolt]].
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|Do you see? It's working. This world will fight for itself if we give it the tools to do so.}}
Suddenly, a group of [[Stormborn Infernal]]s are attacking!

:{{text|say|[[Geth'xun]]|Here is where you insects crawled!}}

:{{text|say|Thrall|Your Master has not won yet.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|I've got this one, shaman. Help the others!}}
