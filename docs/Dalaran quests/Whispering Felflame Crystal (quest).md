==Objectives==
Bring the Whispering Felflame Crystal to [[Aridormi]] in [[Dalaran]], floating above the [[Broken Isles]].

==Description==
The crystal pulses with an eerie, felfire green glow. Holding it, you hear faint echoes of guttural demonic voices. Although the words are jumbled, one is both decipherable and repeated often: Dalaran. 

Perhaps someone in the city floating over the Broken Isles can tell you more about this crystal and its purpose.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
