==Objectives==
Find [[Fargo Flintlocke]] in [[Azsuna]] near the [[Felblaze Ingress]].

==Description==
Yikes! OK. This thing is missing a LOT of parts.

Why don't you go hunt down some new gears or whatever while I do what I can to its existing frame?

A colleague of ours, down in Azsuna, may be able to help out here. His name's Flintlocke.

Fetching parts should keep him out of trouble. Just don't let him BUILD anything.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54|}}
* 1,510 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Shush-it, <class>! This 'ere place is crawlin' with [[demon]]y things.
