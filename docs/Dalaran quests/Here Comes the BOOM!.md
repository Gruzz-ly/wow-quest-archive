==Objectives==
Get Didi's fireworks back from the children in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Didi's Green Fireworks]]
* [[Didi's Blue Fireworks]]
* [[Didi's Purple Fireworks]]
* [[Didi's Red Fireworks]]

==Description==
<Name>, they stole all my [[fireworks]], the little scamps.

You didn't see them? I was just on the verge of creating a new module for [[Reaves]] when these kids came in here and ran off with my fireworks.

I need them back if I'm going to finish what I'm working on. Can you go get them back for me?

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Schematic: Reaves Module: Fireworks Display Mode]]

==Progress==
If I ever get my hands on those kids...

==Completion==
<Didi takes the fireworks from you and continues to work at her bench.>

There we go. All done!

Apply this to your bot, and you should be able to launch fireworks wherever you want! ALL explosions are beautiful in their own way... but fireworks really are something else.

==Notes==
The children in question are [[Dophnu]], [[Phraid]], [[Valmir]], and [[Smacky]] (accompanied by [[Shooby]]). Next to them are the missing barrels - [[Barrel of Green Fireworks|Green]], [[Barrel of Red Fireworks|Red]], [[Barrel of Blue Fireworks|Blue]], and [[Barrel of Purple Fireworks|Purple fireworks]].
