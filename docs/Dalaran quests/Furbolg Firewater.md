==Objectives==
Acquire skins of Smolderhide Firewater from the [[furbolg]] camp in [[Val'sharah]]. Bring them back to [[Deucus Valdera]] in [[Dalaran]] so he can make use of the corks.
* [[Smolderhide Firewater]] (8)

==Description==
Oh! I recognize these corks you brought me, <name>. I recently acquired several from a furbolg tribe in Val'sharah. They need sturdy corks to keep a tight seal on that potent firewater they brew.

We need more firewater potions--the corks would make an ideal addition to our alchemy table!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,340 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find more firewater potions? I bet it's tempting to take a swig!

==Completion==
These potions have the corks we need for the alchemy table. Another successful endeavor!

==Notes==
The quest items are looted in [[Smolderhide Thicket]].

;On completion
*{{Text|say|Deucus Valdera|Nicely done! [[Patricia Egan|Patricia]] has a new recipe for you, <name>.}}
*{{Text|say|Deucus Valdera|Excellent work. Speak to Patricia about a new recipe.}}
