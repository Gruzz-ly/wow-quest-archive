==Completion==
Want to earn a few quick coins? I need subjects to try my newest potion.

Unfortunately, I can't taste this one myself because it contains a few ingredients that I'm allergic to. Drinking this would be incredibly toxic to me. In fact, as far as I'm concerned, this is just one big bottle of poison.

Drink up!
