==Objectives==
Craft a [[:Skaggldrynk]], then go to the [[Vault of the Wardens]] and bathe the crucible in the bile of [[Grimoira]].
* Submerge the [[:Demonsbreath Crucible]] in Grimoira's bile
* [[Grimoira]] slain
* [[Cordana Felsong (tactics)|Cordana Felsong]] slain
* [[Lined Demonsbreath Crucible]] (provided)

==Description==
The key to a crucible like this is that it must be bathed in the foulest of [[fel]] energy. I hate to say it, but the most efficient method of accomplishing such a feat is to subject it to the bile of a [[demon]].

Yes, I said the bile of a demon. Ready to get to work?

In the Vault of the Wardens, such a demon exists. An [[imp mother]] by the name of Grimoira. The door to her room is sealed by an invisible lock.

I'd suggest bringing some Skaggldrynk with you. Use it when you get to her door.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You did it! I must say, I was a bit concerned for your well-being, but once again you've proven resourceful.

Now that the crucible's lining is restored and it has been bathed in demon's bile, it's ready for use on the alchemy table.

Well done!

==Notes==
Kill [[Inquisitor Tormentorum]] and at the door in northern [[Demon's Ward]] use Skaggldrynk. On the door, the [[Rune Lock]] appears. Click on it and enter the [[Vault of Law]] with Grimoira. During the fight stand in the bile she casts until you gain the credit. Then kill her and loot [[Bendy Glass Tubes]] which starts [[Vault of the Wardens: Bendy Glass Tubes]]. Finish the dungeon by killing Cordana and then return to Dalaran to complete both quests.

;On completion
