==Objectives==
Bring the Ancient Sentry Construct Memory Core to [[Timofey Oshenko]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Ancient Sentry Construct Memory Core]] (provided)

==Description==
Unfortunately, I have no idea how to access any information within this core. But I know someone who does.

Head over to "[[Like Clockwork]]", the [[engineering]] shop three doors down from here. Timofey Oshenko owes me a favor. He should be able to extract the memory out of the core.

==Rewards==
* 1,530 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You're here from Alard's shop? What does that musclehead want now?

==Completion==
Oh, a memory core? One moment.
