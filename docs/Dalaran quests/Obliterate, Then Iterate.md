==Objectives==
Use the Unraveling Sands ability to summon the Unraveling Sands, then place the Legion Armor Scraps in the sands to scrap it into Bronze.
*Summon [[Unraveling Sands]] (Optional)
*Scrap [[Legion Armor Scraps#Obliterate Then Iterate]] (provided)
*[[Bronze (quest item)]]

==Description==
Artifact is not what catches eye of Erus. No. You have demon armor scraps.

Now, you might think to yourself, 'but Erus, demon armor scraps are junk', and you might be right. But Erus sees demon scraps and he does not see junk, he sees bronze. Bronze hidden in the junk.

Listen closely, Erus will teach you how to use the Unraveling Sands. You put junk in sands, sands unravels it, and then you get bronze from the ashes.

Try using the Unraveling Sands and then toss in the Legion armor scraps.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||35|75}}
*775 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]
*25x [[Bronze]]

==Progress==
Happy scrapping!

==Completion==
Bronze can be spent at the [[Infinite Bazaar|infinite bazaar]] on many pretty things.

Whenever you find junk, just summon the Unraveling Sands.

Junk goes in, pretty bronze comes out.

Is convenient, yes?

==Notes==
Use the newly-provided [[Unraveling Sands]] ability to summon the portal, then toss the provided [[Legion Armor Scraps#Obliterate Then Iterate]] and any other unwanted armor in the scrapper to get bronze.
