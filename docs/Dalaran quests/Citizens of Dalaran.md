==Objectives==
Help the citizens of Dalaran prepare for the teleportation.
* Citizens of [[Dalaran]] helped (3)

==Description==
Our citizens must be prepared for Dalaran's departure. Can you ask around the city and see if anyone requires aid?

I'd also like for you to speak with [[Brann]] and [[Archmage Drenden]]. They both had concerns that would be best to address before we depart for [[Khaz Algar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|21|6}}
* 7,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Dalaran is always ready to defend the world, but that doesn't mean we can do so on a whim. Preparations are key to a smooth transportation.

==Completion==
Thank you for your help. It's important that the citizens of Dalaran are ready for whatever may come.

==Notes==
Exit the [[Portrait Room]] to the north, and two more quests are available: [[Meet the Team]] from [[Brann Bronzebeard]] and [[Strengthen the Wards]] from [[Archmage Drenden]].

Three citizens need help. [[Lianna Tai (NPC)|Lianna Tai]], the herbalism trainer in the [[Magus Commerce Exchange]]:
