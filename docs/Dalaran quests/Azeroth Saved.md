'''Azeroth Saved''' is a [[Legion Remix]] quest that triggers after completing [[The Burning Throne]] quest. Despite the quest text, it does not require actually completing [[Antorus]] and saving Azeroth.

==Objectives==
Talk to Moratari and answer her question.
*Answer [[Moratari]]'s question

==Description==
<Name>.

You have done it! [[Sargeras]] is gone and [[Azeroth]] is saved.

I can only imagine what must be going through your mind at this moment.

Let us remedy that.

Allow me to record your thoughts and your words. Not as written by a historian who you never met, but by a friend who wished nothing more than to listen.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Progress==
Yes, I am recording these data points for our experiment, but that does not diminish my empathy. I can be thorough and thoughtful at the same time.

==Completion==
Too many histories are written about the WHAT, the WHY, the HOW, and the WHEN. Other than names, however, we so rarely get to truly know the WHO.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Moratari]].
{{Dialogue|
Azeroth is forever changed, <name>. The [[sword of Sargeras]] only failed to kill our beloved world because of the valiant efforts and sacrifices of champions like you. How do you feel knowing that you have become the hero I always knew you to be?

{{gossip|quest=|Sword? [[What sword]]?}}

{{Dialogue-child|
What do you mean, what sword?

<Moratari turns in disbelief, searching for the sword of Sargeras on the horizon.>

{{gossip|quest=|All I see is a monument to the triumph of good over evil.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
<Moratari rolls her eyes.>

How humble of you. But nonetheless, a valid data point!

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}
{{gossip|Nevermind.}}
}}

{{gossip|quest=|I feel unburdened.}}

{{Dialogue-child|
Unburdened. Physically? Mentally? Emotionally?

<Moratari prepares her quill to record your answer.>

Please, the more detail the better. For research purposes, of course.

{{gossip|quest=|The expectations others had for me have been fulfilled, and now my future is my own. Thank you for your guidance, Moratari, but I think I'm going to walk the path before me alone--at least for a little while.}}

{{Dialogue-child|
You have earned it, <name>! Take all the time you need. I will be here when you need me.

<Moratari considers this for a moment.>

If you need me.

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
}}

{{gossip|On second thought...}}
}}

{{gossip|quest=|I feel anxious.}}

{{Dialogue-child|
Anxious? Curious. Care to expand on that feeling?

{{gossip|quest=|The enemy is beaten, but I am not naive as to why [[Eternus]] and the [[Infinite dragonflight|Infinite]] are here. This fight was only the beginning. The artifacts are not the answer you sought. So either there is no hope left, or I'm the hope you were looking for.}}

{{Dialogue-child|
There is always hope, <name>.

<Moratari readies her quill.>

Subject is expressing feelings of hopelessness and despair.

<Moratari looks up from her writings and beams.>

Thank you for your insights.

{{gossip|On second thought...}}
}}

{{gossip|quest=|I feel amazing!}}

{{Dialogue-child|
That's fantastic, <name>! Tell me more.

{{gossip|quest=|The [[Burning Legion]] is beaten, Sargeras has been banished, and I saved Azeroth. Bring on the next challenge. I'm ready for anything.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
That's the spirit, <name>.

<Moratari readies her quill.>

Subject is blissfully ignorant of what is to come.

<Moratari looks up from her writings and beams.>

Thank you for your inspiring insights.

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}

{{gossip|On second thought...}}
}}

{{gossip|quest=|I feel sorrow.}}

{{Dialogue-child|
Sorrow? But you've won. You've saved Azeroth. Shouldn't you be...

<Moratari's voice trails off as she realizes that emotions are raw.>

... happy?

{{gossip|quest=|How many needed to perish in this war? How can the Infinite just watch this unfold and not help? I know there are rules, and I'm sure you have had the very same feelings and questions I have now. Perhaps you still do. Perhaps the whole point of this wasn't to help the Infinite find the power to help save Azeroth, but instead to make sure the Infinite never forget what it feels like to lose something worth fighting for. That's how you save Azeroth--you care about it.}}

{{Dialogue-child|
<Moratari gives you a reassuring look and speaks softly.>

That's the truth of it, <name>. We're doing this specifically because Eternus does care. Too much, sometimes.
