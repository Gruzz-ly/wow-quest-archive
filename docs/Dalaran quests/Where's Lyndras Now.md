==Objectives==
Go the{{sic}} [[Agronomical Apothecary|alchemy shop]] across the street.
* Talk to [[Linzy Blackbolt]]

==Description==
[[Lyndras]] couldn't have gone very far. I mean, we're floating a thousand feet over the [[Great Sea|sea]].

I heard some commotion across the way this morning near the alchemy shop. I pray that wasn't Lyndras.

Could you please go over there and make sure?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
After listening to Linzy's account of what happened in her shop, you feel you must stop Lyndras before he causes any more trouble in [[Dalaran]].

==Notes==
Speak with Linzy.

:{{gossip|I heard you may have seen Lyndras?}}

::Yea, I've seen him. That cursed elf friend of yours came in here and stole one of my ley flame burners! I chased him as far as [[Underbelly|the sewers]] before he slipped away.

::If you find him, make sure he returns that burner, they're very rare.
