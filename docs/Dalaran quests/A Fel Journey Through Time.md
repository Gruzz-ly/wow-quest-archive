==Objectives==
Defeat 5 Timewalking dungeons.
* [[Timewalking]] [[dungeon]]s defeated (5)

==Description==
A corrupting star shines upon the land, threatening all with burning oblivion. The star betrays those who seek the light, its red glow obscuring rather than revealing.

While its influence holds, new paths may open up to distant places and even distant times. No sage truly understands the nature of this sign, but fortune favors the daring.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Timely Goodie Bag]]

==Progress==
I foresee that you will follow the corrupting red star and walk the paths it reveals.

==Completion==
...

==Patch changes==
