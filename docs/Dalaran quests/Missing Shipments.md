==Objectives==
[[Alchemist]] [[Deucus Valdera]] in [[Dalaran]] wants you to locate supplies lost near the water in [[Azsuna]].
* [[Crate of Khadgar's Whiskers]]{{Co|43.9|47.5|Azsuna}}
* [[Barrel of Fish Oil]]{{Co|44.9|52.2|Azsuna}}
* [[Basket of Dried Herbs]]{{Co|44.9|53.5|Azsuna}}

==Description==
Now that we've gotten to know each other, perhaps you can lend me a hand.

My weekly supply shipment was lost when my longtime courier--you know, old whatsername--was shot out of the sky over the shores of Azsuna. Surely a hardy sort like you could retrieve my lost goods.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I say, I do hope you were able to locate my lost supplies. How are we to build trust between us if you won't do everything I ask?

==Completion==
You found them! I had the utmost faith, of course. What's a few [[demon]]s or [[naga]] to one so dedicated to advancing our craft?

==Notes==
Near the Barrel of Fish Oil are a [[Mysterious Skeleton]] and an [[Alchemy Book]] which starts [[A Mysterious Text]].
