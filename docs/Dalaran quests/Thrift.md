==Objectives==
Recover the Dusty Stone Tablet, Bent and Battered Blade, and the Curious Curio for [[Momentus]].
* [[Dusty Stone Tablet]] {{co|40.9|24.0|Dalaran (Broken Isles)}}
* [[Bent and Battered Blade]] {{co|46.1|25.4|Dalaran (Broken Isles)}}
* [[Curious Curio]] {{co|38.8|39.9|Dalaran (Broken Isles)}}

==Description==
If we're going to help [[Khadgar]], [[Dalaran]], and our experiment, we're going to need to get you an [[artifact]].

Luckily I have a plan to accomplish just this.

Dalaran is currently loaded with all manner of temporally important items--so called epoch objects. We'll gather up a few that won't be missed, blame their disappearance on the [[Burning Legion|Legion]], and then use them to get you that artifact.

Here, I've made a shopping list.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||20}}
*1,750 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Progress==
These objects are loaded with epoch significance.

==Completion==
A fine collection of epoch objects.

==Notes==
The [[Dusty Stone Tablet]] is in an [[Archeology Chest]] in [[Things of the Past]]:
:{{text|say|Momentus|An ancient tablet locked away in a dusty chest? What a waste of valuable knowledge!}}

The [[Bent and Battered Blade]] is in a [[Weapon Crate (Legion Remix)|Weapon Crate]] upstairs in [[Tanks for Everything]]:
:{{text|say|Momentus|That bent and battered blade has seen exactly as many battles as you think it has.}}

The [[Curious Curio]] is in a [[Curio Lockbox]] in [[Simply Enchanting]]:
:{{text|say|Momentus|Oddities like that one tend to be great sources of temporal energy, thanks to the actions of their owners.}}

Upon completion of [[Thrift]] and [[Threadbare]]:
:{{text|say|Momentus|Ah, you're back! Now to forge some infinite bronze from what you've collected.}}
