==Objectives==
Select your artifact weapon.
*Choose a different talent specialization (Optional)
* Speak to [[Momentus]] after choosing a talent specialization
* Artifact Swapped
* Purchase [[Remix Time]] trait in your Artifact Weapon

==Description==
Now that you have your infinite bronze, we just need to select the right artifact for you, shape the bronze into a suitable simulacrum of the weapon, and then reach through a temporal knot and swap them.

No one will be the wiser.

All we have to do is remember to reclaim the simulacrum in this timeline and everything will work itself out.

Let's start by selecting your specialization, that'll determine which artifact we'll be borrowing.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
: {{abilities|"Borrowed" Artifact Weapon|Who knows what will happen when you borrow power from the future? It has infinite potential!|id=1232822|icon=inv_legendary_sword}}
You will receive:
*{{Cost||71|50}}
*1,550 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]
*25x [[Infinite Power]]

==Progress==
Every artifacts{{sic}} needs a mighty hero to wield it.

==Completion==
Intriguing. This artifact's potential has been deepened, perhaps by the fraying of this timeline. It can harness more power than any incarnation of it that I have yet encountered.

Let me record that data point for [[Moratari]].

Oh, important reminder--don't forget to recover the bronze simulacrum later or things might get... funky.

And lastly, maybe don't mention to people how you got that. It could ruin the experiment.

==Notes==
Speak with Momentus again:
{{dialogue|
Have you decided on your specialization?

{{text|red|<To change your class specialization, navigate to your Talents (default hotkey: N).>}}

{{plainlist|
* {{gossip|quest=|I am in my preferred class specialization.}}
* {{gossip|Let me think about it.}}
}}}}

The quest option opens a confirmation dialogue:
{{dialogue|{{text|yellow|Are you sure you want to proceed with your current specialization?}}

This choice affects your starting weapon and cannot be changed. You will eventually be able to acquire a weapon for each specialization.}}
:{{text|say|Momentus|Excellent choice! Now I'll reach through time and space to secure your artifact.}}

Interact with the [[Temporal Knot]] in front of Momentus. This shows the traditional Legion artifact cutscene:
:{{text|say|Momentus|This artifact has been altered--and enhanced--by this timeline's temporal energy... Its powers are different from before!}}

Open the character sheet, then shift-right-click on the equipped weapon to open the new artifact talent tree, then pick the left-most talent: Remix Time.
