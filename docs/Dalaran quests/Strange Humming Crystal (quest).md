==Objectives==
Take the [[:Strange Humming Crystal]] to [[Khadgar]] in [[Dalaran]].

==Description==
<You place the crystal to your ear and hear the disharmonious din of hundreds of voices speaking at once. Perhaps Khadgar might know more about this strange gem.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Such a cacophony! I could hear it before you pulled it from your pack.

What you've got there is a [[highborne]] memory crystal, somehow still intact. Created by ancient sorcery, they were used to store memories, stories, music, history, and whatnot.

Quite rare! With a little... tinkering... I should be able to create something useful with it.
