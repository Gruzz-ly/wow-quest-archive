==Objectives==
Bring the Fragile Demonsbreath Crucible to [[Deucus Valdera]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Fragile Demonsbreath Crucible]]

==Description==
I have customers asking for alchemist stones, but I'm unable to make any until I replace my crucible.

In order to create a new one, we'll need a few things, but first we'll need a proper container. Something that can be augmented to withstand a [[demon]]'s breath.

There's a place in [[Suramar]] which the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] has occupied. There surely must be a device there we can take that will be suitable for our needs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I trust you're strong enough to handle a few demons?

==Completion==
You've found something quite intriguing here! Others have brought me fragments of such implements, but never so complete a sample.

This is going to require a lot of work...

==Notes==
The quest item is in [[Felsoul Hold]].{{Co|29.7|82.9|Suramar}}
