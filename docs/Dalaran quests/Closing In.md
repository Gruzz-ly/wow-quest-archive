==Objectives==
Confront [[Akaari Shadowgore]] in the [[Legerdemain Lounge]].
* Akaari confronted

==Description==
The Legerdemain Lounge isn't far from here. We have agents nearby who can secure the area.

Come prepared for a fight. Akaari won't go down easily.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (level 100)
* 15,050 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Progress==
I can't believe it...

==Completion==
It was a ruse?!

==Notes==
On accept, Valeera begins running up the stairs to the southeast before despawning.
:{{text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|Akaari... your time has come.}}

At the Legerdemain Lounge, several [[Uncrowned Peacekeeper]]s are patrolling or guarding the building. Some of the lounge's patrons are cowering in fear in the corner. Valeera is standing in the center of the lounge.
:{{text|say|Uncrowned Peacekeeper|The lounge is secure, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|Akaari retreated upstairs as we arrived. She's all yours.}}

Once you ascend the stairs to the upper floor, Akaari emerges from one of the rooms.
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|I should thank you. You've saved me the effort of finding you.}}

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|[[Kil'jaeden]] will be pleased when I bring him your head.}}

During fight:
*{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|One by one, you will all fall to the [[Fangs of the Devourer|Fangs]].}}
*{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|Kirel volosh!}}
*{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|Miserable worm. Die!}}

Upon killing Akaari, however, she drops the illusion and is revealed to actually be a [[Shadowgore Bloodmaiden]].
:{{text|say|Shadowgore Bloodmaiden|You think my master so foolish...?}}

Valeera runs up the stairs and walks into the room.
:{{text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|Do you have the fangs?}}
