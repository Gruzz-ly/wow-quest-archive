==Objectives==
Gather [[Lyndras]]' Pinking Shears, his Box of Measuring Tools and his Threading Needles from where you first met him in [[Azsuna]].
* [[Lyndras' Pinking Shears]]
* [[Box of Measuring Tools]]
* [[Lyndras' Threading Needles]]

==Description==
I do truly want to help you work on your tailoring, but without my patterns or my supplies, there isn't much more I can do save for teaching you what little I remember.

If my memory still serves true, you're just missing a good pattern for some gloves and a hood.

The first thing I need you to do is grab a few things from where you first met me. Here's what I need...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 16,170 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I had no clue I'd be magically teleported [[Dalaran|here]], otherwise I would have gathered my things myself.

==Completion==
Excellent! It's always nice to have familiar things.

This will make instructing you much easier for me.
