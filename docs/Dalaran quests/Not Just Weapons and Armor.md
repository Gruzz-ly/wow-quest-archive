==Objectives==
Craft 4 Hard Leystone Bars and 24 Hard Leystone Nails.
* [[Hard Leystone Bar]] (4)
* [[Hard Leystone Nail]] (24)

==Description==
You know, we aren't just limited to armorsmithing and weaponsmithing. I regularly make chisels for the scribes, crucibles for the [[alchemist]]s, and even thimbles for the tailors.

They should sew in full plate gauntlets if they're really all that worried about their poor little thumbs.

Anyhow, I have a recipe I think an [[adventurer]] like you might be interested in. Let's try it out.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Recipe: Leystone Hoofplates]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|17|67|50}}
* 15,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let's get to work. I think you'll enjoy this.

==Completion==
Let me take those bars, make a few adjustments and...

Ta da! Hoofplates for your mount!

==Notes==
On accept, the player learns the following item recipes: [[Leystone Slag]], [[Hard Leystone Bar]], [[Leystone Shards]], [[Lumps of Leystone Slag]], [[Hard Leystone Ingots]], [[Heated Hard Leystone Ingot]], [[Hard Leystone Nail]], and receives 5x [[Shopkeeper's Leystone Ore]].

Just like in the previous quest in the area, use the glowing objects and create the required items.
