==Objectives==
Talk to [[Alard Schmied]] about the list of things you need done.
* [[Deucus' Conduit List]] (provided)

==Description==
While it's no secret my time is more valuable than... well, anyone's, I fear I must step in and help to replace my [[Broken High-Capacity Decoction Conduit|decoction conduit]].

You will also play a crucial part in this, <name>, as my liaison with the [[Smith|blacksmiths]]. The thought of getting soot on my robes curls my toes.

Here's a list of what we'll need done. Meanwhile I'll be out gathering the rest of what's needed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What's this then?

<Alard takes the list and looks it over. His eyes widen as he reaches the bottom>

I take it you don't fully grasp what it is that you need, do you? If this is truly what's required then we better get started.
