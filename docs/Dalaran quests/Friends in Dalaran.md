==Objectives==
Accept a ride to [[Dalaran]] from the flight master and speak with [[Uda the Beast]] at [[The Filthy Animal]].

==Description==
Welcome to [[Northrend]]. I have been asked to arrange travel for you to [[Dalaran]] so that you can meet our friends in the city.

Speak with me and accept a ride to [[Dalaran]]. Once you land, make your way to [[The Filthy Animal]].

Make contact with [[Uda the Beast]] immediately.

She can help you bind your hearthstone to the city so you can use the portal in Sunreaver's Sanctuary to travel back to [[Orgrimmar]] quickly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|0}} (or {{coppercost|780}} at max level)
*1250 XP (or {{coppercost|780}} at max level)

==Completion==
I've been expecting you! This inn is part of Sunreaver's Sanctuary, the Horde's enclave in Dalaran.

Don't forget to bind your hearthstone here for easy travel to the city and access to the portal to Orgrimmar, out by the fountain.
