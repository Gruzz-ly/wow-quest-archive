==Progress==
These seals provide an additional chance at treasure in dungeons and raids, but at what cost? Your order will certainly not miss these extra resources, but I must ask: When does it end? Will you ever stop risking others lives just to satisfy your greedy nature?

You can only obtain three seals per week.  This counts as one of those three. Next week, I will have others.
* Collect: [[Order Resources]] (1000)

==Completion==
Feeling safe, stranger?

==Rewards==
You will receive: [[Seal of Broken Fate]]

==Notes==
Players may acquire THREE Seals of Broken Fate every week, and this weekly quest counts as one of those three acquisitions. It is cheapest overall to spread out the acquisitions over the two different currencies, [[Order Resources]] and Gold, as acquiring an additional seal with the same currency will cost double the amount.
