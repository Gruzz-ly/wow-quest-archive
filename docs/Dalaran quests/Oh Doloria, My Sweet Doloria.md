==Objectives==
Seek out [[Doloria]] in the [[Legerdemain Lounge]] in [[Dalaran]]

* Travel to the Legerdermain Lounge

==Description==
What Ho! We are quite the dashing pair of [[adventurer]]s aren't we?

Now that we have secured my belongings, a new path unfolds before us. I did not journey here simply to thwart the [[Third invasion of the Burning Legion|demon invasion]], no! I came here in search of my beloved, my loved, Doloria. Whilst resting between slaying of dragons, I had a dream, almost a vision. It told me Doloria had been kidnapped and taken to a floating city in the sky!

It must be Dalaran. Quickly Squire, mount up and meet me at Dalaran's famous Inn. Make haste!

==Completion==
Blast, I didn't think he would find me again so fast.
