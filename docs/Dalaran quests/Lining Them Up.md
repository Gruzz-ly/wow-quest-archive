Since you're heading to [[Azsuna]], you may as well gather some lining for our projects.

Hunt them in the woods around [[Llothien]] and bring their fur back with you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 16,170 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't take them for easy prey. They're as vicious as they are cunning.
