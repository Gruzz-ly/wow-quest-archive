==Objectives==
Meet with [[Khadgar]] within the [[Violet Citadel]] in [[Dalaran]].

==Description==
Welcome to Dalaran, <name>. I'm glad you made it through safely.

Speak to me within the Violet Citadel. There's much to do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}
*1,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good to see you again, <name>.

The [[Broken Isles]] is in dire need of aid.

==Notes==
This quest is automatically received upon entering Dalaran on the Broken Isles as a [[Dracthyr (playable)|dracthyr]] [[evoker]]. Since the evoker class was added after ''Legion'', they lack a class hall campaign.
