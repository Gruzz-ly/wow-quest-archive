==Objectives==
Observe [[Deucus Valdera]] as he attempts one of the [[vrykul]] recipes.
* Attempt to make a [[:Draught of Raw Magic]]

==Description==
The tome contains a wealth of ancient vrykul recipes! Why, I could be the first [[alchemist]] in untold ages to craft one! How fortunate for you, friend <name>, that you are here to bear witness to my greatness!

Awful kind of that [[Svena the Infused|Svena]] person to die and leave her book for us, eh? Silly vrykul...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My poor table!

All the implements we needed to mix the new potions were on that table. Without them, the new recipes are useless!

Finding replacements will be no small task, but I'm confident you're up to it. If you need guidance, I can suggest places to look for the items we need.

Now, off with you!
