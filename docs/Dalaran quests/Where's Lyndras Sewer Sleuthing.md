==Objectives==
Search the [[Underbelly|sewers]] for clues as to where [[Lyndras]] has gone.
* Track down Lyndras

==Description==

You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Lyndras has once again eluded you. He must be found soon before something happens to him.

==Notes==
The quest objective is [[Flitz]]:

:You lookin for that crazy elf? Yea, I seen'im. He was down here making a huge ruckus and trying to munch on some sorta magical dust or something.

:I chased him off through, can't have the likes of him hanging around the shop.

:{{gossip|Where did he run off to?}}

:{{text|say|Flitz|Well, I chased him around until he scrambled up a pipe that leads up top in front of [[Violet Hold]]. You'll probably wanna go looking around up there somewhere.}}
