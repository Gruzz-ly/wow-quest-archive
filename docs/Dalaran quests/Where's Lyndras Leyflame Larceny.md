==Objectives==
Ask the Violet Hold guards about [[Lyndras]].
* Ask About Lyndras

==Description==
The guards here must have seen Lyndras come through. The trail of ley dust isn't exactly hard to miss either.

Perhaps one of the guards knows what became of Lyndras.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You looking for that crazed elf? Sorry to say he's been locked up.

We found him hunched in the corner making all sorts of noise and when we approached him, he attacked one of our guards.

We also found him with an item that was reported stolen. We had no choice but to lock him up in [[Violet Hold]].
