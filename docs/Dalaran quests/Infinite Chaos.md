'''Infinite Chaos''' unlocks access to the [[Heroic World Tier]] of [[Legion Remix]]. Players must first finish the introduction questline before [[Eternus]] will offer this quest.

==Objectives==
Explore the Heroic World Tier.
* Speak with Eternus (Optional)
* Use the [[Console of Infinite Chaos]] to enter the Heroic World Tier
* Enemies slain in Heroic World Tier (15)
* Empowered enemies slain in Heroic World Tier (3)
* [[Experiment Instructions]] (provided)

==Description==
You may think this ironic, but our time is running short, <name>. Great forces threaten more than one world's future.

[[Nozdormu]] won't like it, but I must hasten our study with experimentation. I have isolated a fractured timeline for you to explore. But be warned--this realm is devoid of all hope. It is the only way I can truly prepare us for what is to come.

I have established a research console by the [[fel]] monument behind you. Use it to enter this forbidden future so that we may learn the unknowable.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||20}}
*2,150 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]
*1000x [[Bronze]]

==Progress==
Have you seen the dark times that could have been?

==Completion==
You are braver than I thought, <name>.

Please continue to experiment. I will not let us enter dangerous futures unprepared.

==Notes==
Eternus hands over the [[Experiment Instructions]], which read:
{{book|content=
<Name>,

You have much work ahead of you so I'll be brief.

In addition to an overall greater danger in this timeline, certain enemies will be empowered with one, two, or even four experimental changes.

Should this timeline prove too difficult, you may use the research console at our Infinite Bazaar near Dalaran to exit the experiment. I have also ensured safe passage in the event of your untimely demise--you will understand should ill fate befall you.

Best of luck,<br>
Eternus

Speak with her:
{{dialogue|
{{gossip|quest=|I have questions about your experiments.}}

Yes, what is it?

{{gossip|Why are we studying the Legion?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Perhaps you will understand in time.

Xal'atath, Sargeras, the Titans--I see them all like puzzle pieces in the aether. But how they all fit together, that I do not yet know.

{{gossip|I want to ask about something else.}}}}

{{gossip|How exactly are you experimenting?}}
{{dialogue-child|Even small changes can cause great divergences. But what changes are possible without divergence?

I will subtly manipulate the Legion's forces to simulate what perils we may face in the not-to-distant{{sic}} future. Do not worry about how, you will have enough worries with your own survival.

{{gossip|I want to ask about something else.}}}}

{{gossip|What are you trying to learn?}}
{{dialogue-child|The Legion's forces nearly wiped out Azeroth's greatest champions. In how many timelines would we have succeeded?

Was it the artifacts that saved Azeroth, or perhaps something else entirely?

I have my theories, but I will withhold them until we have more evidence.

{{gossip|I want to ask about something else.}}}}

{{gossip|On second thought...}}

Interact with the [[Console of Infinite Chaos]] to open up another confirmation window:

{{dialogue|You are about to enter the Heroic World Tier where Eternus is experimenting dangerously with the timeline.

{{text|yellow|This significantly increases the difficulty of outdoor activities. You may return to the Normal World Tier at any time through this console.}}

Do you wish to proceed?}}

Hit Yes to change the timeline:
:{{text|say|Eternus|We must act boldly with the time that remains. Reward seldom comes without risk.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|You are now in an altered timeline where I have greatly empowered some of the creatures you will encounter.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Find and defeat these creatures to claim the temporal energy coursing through them. But know that you will be in for a challenge.}}

Players are given the Temporal Retreat spell:
:{{abilities|Temporal Retreat|Return to the Normal World Tier|notes=10 sec cast|id=1241425}}

The UI also displays a big icon below the minimap:
:You are in Heroic World Tier. Outdoor difficulty is significantly increased. To exit Heroic World Tier, cast Temporal Retreat from your General Spellbook.
