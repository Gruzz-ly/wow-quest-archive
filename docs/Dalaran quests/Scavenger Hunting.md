==Objectives==
Loot Legion Armor Scraps from the [[demon]]s around [[Dalaran]].
* [[Legion Armor Scraps]]

==Description==
[[Momentus]] may be expert what makes things, but [[Erus]] be expert what break things!

<Erus energetically punches his fist into his palm to accentuate the word "break".>

Go. Kill demons. Take their armor scraps. Then we get to scrapping!

I love scrapping.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||71|50}}
*1,550 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Progress==
One demon's trash is an infinite dragon's bronze.

==Completion==
Good. Good. You do well. Artifact grows stronger. Almost as strong as Erus.

<Erus laughs at his own boast.>

==Notes==
Kill demons until the [[Legion Armor Scraps]] drop.

Upon accepting [[As A Matter of Artifact]], [[Get Plenty of Exorcise]] and [[Scavenger Hunting]]:
:{{text|say|Momentus|Take that new artifact for a spin! Defeating enemies will provide temporal energy to further empower it, and armor for Erus to scrap.}}
