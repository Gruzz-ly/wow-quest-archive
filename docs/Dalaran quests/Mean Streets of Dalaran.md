==Objectives==
Purge demons from [[Dalaran]].
*[[Burning Legion|Legion]] [[demon]]s purged (0/100%)
*Meet [[Khadgar]] at the [[Chamber of the Guardian]].

==Description==
The rest of the [[Council of Six|Council]] and I are currently barricaded in the Chamber of the Guardian working on a solution.

In the meantime, we could use your help by taking some of the Legion's attention off us so we have time to think.

Once you've bought us enough time to properly assess the situation, join me in the Chamber of the Guardian so we can turn this situation around and put the Legion on the defensive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||20}}
*2,150 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Progress==
Dalaran could use a few less demons.

==Completion==
Well met, <name>, and splendid work. You took the pressure off us just long enough to get a handle on this whole debacle.
