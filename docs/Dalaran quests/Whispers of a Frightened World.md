==Objectives==
Meet [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]] in [[Sholazar Basin]] and hear the warning.
*(Optional) Take the [[Dalaran]] portal to [[Wyrmrest Temple]]
*Meet Magni in Sholazar Basin
*Meet Magni in [[Makers' Overlook|The Makers' Overlook]]
*[[Power Conduit|Conduits]] opened (3)
*Hear Azeroth's warning

==Description==
"Champion! [[Azeroth (titan)|Azeroth]] needs our help."

<Magni Bronzebeard's words echo in your mind, as if rising from somewhere deep and ancient. [[Azeroth]]'s [[World-soul|world soul]] seeks to deliver a warning to the Speaker, but some force is interfering with the message.>

<Magni has urged you to travel to Sholazar Basin, the vibrant heart of frozen [[Northrend]], to aid him.>


''If accepting from Archmage Khadgar:''

Champion, Magni needs your help!

The Speaker has a message for you, perhaps from Azeroth herself. He seems to be having trouble understanding her, but I'm sure he can explain everything better.

He said he was in Sholazar Basin, in Northrend. He should be contacting you shortly. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*16,450 [[XP]]
*[[Defense Construct Identifier]]

==Progress==
Yes, <name>? What news do you bring?

==Completion==
This warning is an ill omen indeed, <name>. It seems the fate of Azeroth is tied to that of Argus, the homeworld of the Legion.

We must uncover the [[Sargeras|Dark Titan]]'s plan! I believe the Speaker's connection to the world soul will prove crucial to our efforts.

Stay vigilant, <class title>. We must trust in Magni's guidance... and Azeroth's as well.

==Notes==
;Quest accept
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Champion! Azeroth needs our help.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|She's tryin' ta send me a message... a warning, methinks. But somethin's not right with her.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Meet me in Sholazar Basin up in Northrend. Together, we'll get ta the bottom o' this!}}

;Entering Sholazar Basin
:''As you enter Sholazar Basin, a [http://www.wowhead.com/spell=240146/magni-communication-crystal floating crystal] appears near you.''
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Ah, yer gettin' close. Come ta the [[Makers' Overlook]], high in the eastern mountains. I'll show ye the way inside.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|A shame [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]] didn't come with ye. ''(Chuckles)'' Nothin' me brother loves more than openin' [[titan]] doors!}}

;Approach Overlook entrance
:{{text|say|[[Monitor Construct]]|Subject identified: ally of Speaker. Annihilation protocols suspended.}}

;Enter corridor
:{{text|say|Monitor Construct|Subject vitals within normal parameters. The Speaker awaits you.}}

;Approach Power Conduit
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|All right, I got everythin' set up on this end. Activate the power conduits and the pad'll be operational!}}
:''In order to progress, you have to activate 3 Power Conduits on the ground to activate a teleportation pad.''

;Conduits opened
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Here ya go. This pad'll bring ye deep below ground, ta a place no mortal has walked in millennia... the [[Hall of Communion|Hall o' Communion]]! C'mon down, I've got a lot to show ye.}}

===Stage 1: Speaking with the Speaker===
* Find Magni

:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|The titans built these halls ta watch over the soul o' the world. From this chamber I can hear her, clear as diamond.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Lately she's seemed... troubled. Hard ta read. I hope ye can help me get through ta her.}}

Notice that you can hear what sounds like a steady heartbeat in the background.

===Stage 2: Dreams Beyond Dreams===
* Defeat the invaders (7)

:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Somethin's triggered the defenses! Careful now, ye've got company!}}

The heartbeat in the background has sped up, as though in distress. In front of you, you can see the shapes of what appear to be minions of the [[Old God]]s, assaulting the defenses. Kill any [[Distressing Vision]], [[Unsettling Despair]], and [[Haunting Phantasm (n'raqi)|Haunting Phantasm]]s you come across.
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|These phantoms must be her dreams... her nightmares. If we help her overcome these horrors, Azeroth should be able ta give us her message.}}

===Stage 3: The Stuff of Nightmares===
[[File:Hall of Communion 2.jpg|thumb]]
* Reactivate the defenses (4)

:{{text|say|[[Defense Node]]|Threat neutralized. Deploying repair matrix.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|I sense her fear... her doubt. We've gotta help her! Looks like some o' the defenses are down. If ye reactivate 'em, it might help snap her out o' this!}}

The heartbeat returns to a more normal pace, but not for long. Upon stepping across into the next area, more of the same creatures are seen, with the addition of [[Disturbing Echo]]es plus [[Nightmarish Horror]]s, which have the shape of [[shivarra]], and [[Coalescing Nightmare]], seen as [[felstalker]]s. Repair the [[Damaged Construct]]s around the room to help fight them off.
:{{text|say|[[Defense Construct]]|Self-repair mode resumed. External assistance evaluation: appreciated.}}
:''The construct casts Dream Sedation Protocol to remove a nearby tentacle horror.''
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Talkin' to a world soul ain't like chattin' with a mortal. Might be why she needed someone ta become her Speaker.}}

Second defense construct:
:{{text|say|Defense Construct|Reactivation sequence complete. Initiating sentry protocols.}}

Third defense construct:
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|She's haunted by the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]... and the Old Gods. But there be somethin' more... a greater darkness...}}

===Stage 4: Night Terror===
* [[Amalgam of Torment]] defeated

:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|That's it! Her thoughts be clearin' up. She's feelin'... fear. Watch out!}}

An [[aberration]] manifests and begins to fight you, echoing the words of battles past. Although the aberration is an elite mob, the defense construct will assist you by periodically casting Suppression Protocol, which stuns the aberration for a moderate amount of time.
:{{text|say|Defense Construct|Facility lockdown confirmed. Engaging threat.}}
:{{text|yell|Amalgam of Torment|Look upon the [[Yogg-Saron (tactics)|true face of death]], and know that your end comes soon!}}
:{{text|yell|Amalgam of Torment|The pain of flesh is fleeting. [[Il'gynoth|True torment lasts forever]].}}
:{{text|yell|Amalgam of Torment|You are BLIND. [[Garrosh Hellscream (tactics)|I WILL FORCE YOUR EYES OPEN]].}}
:{{text|yell|Amalgam of Torment|Soon [[Archimonde (tactics)|the heart of your world]] will beat no more!}}
:{{text|yell|Amalgam of Torment|[[C'Thun (tactics)|Your courage will fail]].}}

Amalgam defeated:
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Ye did it! The nightmares are contained. Keep going, I'm just ahead in the next chamber.}}

===Stage 5: Dark Revelations===
* Speak with [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]]

Continue north to meet with Magni in the [[Chamber of Observance]].<!-- While in chamber, "Heartbeat" is constantly highlighted. Looking below, the chamber appears to be directly overlooking the world soul's heart. --> On the way you'll pass the [[Maiden of Vitality]], who is responsible for monitoring the world soul's vitals.
:{{text|say|Maiden of Vitality|Threat signatures neutralized. Facility defenses at 74.39 percent. Repairs in progress.}}
:{{text|say|Maiden of Vitality|Subject: [[Azeroth (titan)|Azeroth]]. Minor {{wplink|Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia}} detected, but vitals within acceptable parameters. Incident reports updated.}}

Magni is looking over a console, but will turn to greet you as you approach.
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|'Tis good ta see ye, <name>. Now that the nightmares are gone, we can find out what she wants ta tell us. Give the word and we'll begin.}}

Speak with Magni to hear Azeroth's warning.
:She's calmer now, but still troubled. I should be able ta reach her.

:Are ye ready, <name>?

:{{gossip|Let us hear what she has to say, Magni.}}

===Final Stage: A Word of Warning===
* Hear Azeroth's Warning

:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Talk ta me, lass. Tell me what's got ye all in a tizzy...}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Her feelin's are a jumble. I need ta focus, let her thoughts flow into--UNNGG!}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|[[Silithus|Sands]]... soaked in pain. Rivers... rivers of blood.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Skies aflame. [[Sword of Sargeras|A sword]]... in the darkness... [[Silithus|the wound]]... burning...}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Sar...ger...as...}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|The [[Sargeras|Dark Titan]] comes! We gotta stop him! [[Argus]]... the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s homeworld. She says our destiny lies there.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Looks like we've got some preparin' ta do, champion! Ye best tell [[Khadgar]] what we've learned. Good luck!}}

Take the teleportation pad next to Magni to return to Dalaran. If you try to talk to him he will say:
:Don't worry lass, we'll protect ye. We've got to!
