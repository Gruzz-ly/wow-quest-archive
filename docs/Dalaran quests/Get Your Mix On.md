==Objectives==
[[Deucus Valdera]] in [[Dalaran]] wants you to craft some new [[potion]]s. Merchant [[Patricia Egan]] in the [[alchemy]] [[shop]] can help you learn how. 
* Craft an [[Ancient Healing Potion]]
* Craft an [[Ancient Mana Potion]]
* Craft an [[Ancient Rejuvenation Potion]]

==Description==
Let's see... potion stains on your tabard, crushed herbs on your boots... I know a fellow [[alchemist]] when I see one!

We will do good work together, the two of us. I trust you're not averse to learning new tricks.

Be sure to use my state-of-the-art alchemy table. I built her myself!

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Alchemy|Legion Alchemist]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost||56|}}
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope you're making good use of my alchemy table. It's my pride and joy!

==Completion==
I trust you were successful in making the potions? This will be the first step in building trust between us.
