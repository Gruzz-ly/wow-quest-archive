'''Skin Deep''' is about collecting crafting material. This can either be done by [[Skinning]] or trading from other players. Half of the Material requested will be returned to the player.

==Objectives==
Acquire 20 Stonehide Leather and 5 Stormscales. If you are not a skinner, you may acquire them from the auction house or other players.
*[[Stonehide Leather]] (20)
*[[Stormscale]] (5)

==Description==
Welcome, <name>. It's an honor to be working with someone of your caliber.

In order for us to begin our work together, we'll first need to collect some materials.

The [[Broken Isles]] are home to many strange, exotic creatures which no doubt have interesting hides to experiment with. We'll need scales to make mail armor with as well.

Go and collect some materials for us so we may begin working.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=10|Stonehide Leather
|q2=3|Stormscale
}}

You will also learn: [[Leatherworking|Legion Leatherworking]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I trust you gave the creatures a merciful death?

==Completion==
These materials have my mind racing. I can't wait to see what we can make with them!

I'm just going to keep some to study. You can have the rest back.

==Notes==
[[Namha Moonwater]] is found at Magus Commerce Exchange in [[Dalaran]] after it moved to [[Broken Shore]].
