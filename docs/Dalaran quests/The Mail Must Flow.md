==Objectives==
Help the [[Postmaster]] sort at least 15 letters within the time limit.
* Sort at Least 15 Letters

==Description==
Due to all of the recent shenanigans, I'm running short on mailementals to sort letters.

It's a simple job, really - just toss the letter into the proper portal, where it will be whisked away to the far corners of [[Azeroth]] and beyond.

I like to make a little game out of it. How many can you sort in one minute?

==Rewards==
*You will receive: 
*[[The Total Package]]
* {{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well done! 

Is it not fulfilling? To see each letter safely to its destination?

Come by and help any time!

==Notes==
;Interact with The Postmaster
:I need help sorting these letters!
''{{Gossip|I want to sort letters!}}''

This starts the mail sorting minigame. The camera zooms in to the six mail tubes, each showing a continent, listed in the order of introduction (but skipping Draenor):
*[[Kalimdor]]
*[[Eastern Kingdoms]]
*[[Outland]]
*[[Northrend]]
*[[Pandaria]]
*[[Broken Isles]]

Players have sixty seconds to click on the right continent for a town and zone combination. For the quest, only fifteen correct sorts are required.

;Completion
:{{Text|say|The Postmaster|Excellent work, <name>! You might be ready for something more challenging... Speak with me if you're interested!}}

This will unlock the challenge achievements [[Post Haste]] and [[Priority Mail]].

==Letters==
After completing the quest, you will receive an in-game mail from the Postmaster with a [[Bulging Package]]:
{{Book|Through Sleet and Snow|align=left|content=
<Name>,

It is through your actions and heroism that the mail continues to flow successfully throughout Azeroth and beyond.

However, I must come clean - I have not been completely honest with you.

The events which first brought you here were orchestrated - I knew you were the only one that could save the [[Postmaster's Office|post office]] from an undue end.

I cannot rely on you forever - the mail must be able to operate without your aid. I must ask you to help me orchestrate once more to guide more into these stamped halls to give me aid.

Take the attached message and send it to someone you deem worthy to carry the torch forward. I've included a whistle to call [[Katy Stampwhistle|Katy]] to your side should you need her aid.

I trust you to the end.

- The Postmaster}}

After one day of completing [[Due Reward]], you will also receive another with a [[Timeworn Heirloom Armor Casing]], from [[Johnny Awesome]]:
{{Book|A Tip for Your Troubles|align=left|content=
Dearest <name>,

I look back upon our adventures together as if they happened yesterday.

Several of my admirers informed me that you looked rather... sullen... when last we met. While I see no reason for such behavior when you had the pleasure of working with the world-renowned Johnny Awesome, I did feel a twang of... what was it... pity?

Being as such, I felt it appropriate to send you this tip as a token of my appreciation for your efforts.

Do people still tip? If people do NOT still tip, please return all attachments to me at once, along with a small amount of coin to cover my shipping costs.
