==Completion==
Want to earn a few quick coins? I need subjects to try this potion.

I spent most of my development time focusing on the potion's effects, and not a lot on its... pleasantness. You may have to ignore the taste, smell, mouthfeel, and appearance.

Actually, I think I heard a few SOUNDS coming from this particular potion... you should ignore those, too.

Cheers!
