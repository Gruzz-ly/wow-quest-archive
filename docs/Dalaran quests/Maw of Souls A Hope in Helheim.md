==Objectives==
Retrieve a crate of Dragur Dust from Heroic: [[Maw of Souls]], craft a Flask of the Seventh Demon and return both items to [[Alard Schmied|Alard]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Dragur Dust]]
* [[Flask of the Seventh Demon]]

==Description==
For this last ingredient, well...

<Alard begins pondering for a moment, then nods his head.>

Yes, that's the only way. For this last one, you'll need to go to the land of the damned, [[Helheim]].

Well, not there exactly, but aboard the boat that ferries the dead across the [[Maw of Souls]]. Upon that boat may be the final ingredient we need.

It's called Dragur Dust. Keep an eye out for it.

Also, one needs to be quick when adding this ingredient. I'll need something to heighten my reflexes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to board the ship? Did you find the dust?

==Completion==
It was there? You found some?

<Alard takes the crate and opens it. He reels back from the smell.>

Yep, that's the stuff alright. By the light, does that reek.
