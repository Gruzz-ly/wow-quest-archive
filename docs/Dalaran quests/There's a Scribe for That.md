==Objectives==
Bring the Runewritten Tome to [[Professor Pallin]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Runewritten Tome Translation]]
* [[Runewritten Tome]] (provided)

==Description==
Fine! I admit, even my considerable intellect can't translate the strange tome you discovered. No doubt the water smears made it illegible.

Say, one of those dimwitted scribes down the block owes me a favor. This sort of busywork is just his cup of tea.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I don't have time to translate tomes! That's what lesser professions are for.

==Completion==
It seems that twerp of a [[scribe]] has his uses after all! Let's see what he came up with...

==Notes==
;Speaking with [[Professor Pallin]]
:{{Gossip|Deucus said you owe him a favor. I have a tome in need of translation.}}
:{{Text|say|Professor Pallin|I suppose I do owe that blowhard a favor. Lucky for you, translation is my specialty!}}
:''Pallin casts a spell.''
:{{Text|say|Professor Pallin|This is ancient [[vrykul]] script, the property of someone named "[[Svena the Infused|Svena]]". A rare and intriguing find indeed. Tell Deucus he is now in MY debt!}}
