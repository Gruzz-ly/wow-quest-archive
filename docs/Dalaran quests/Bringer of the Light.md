==Objectives==
Discover the purpose of the {{Item|Mysterious Lightbound Object}}.
*Purpose of the Mysterious Lightbound Object discovered

==Description==
[[Turalyon]] lives! For ages I had thought that my old friend had perished on some desolate [[Burning Legion|Legion]] world. But to know that he yet lives and is in danger is too much to bear.

We must hurry, <name>. We must uncover the object's sacred purpose.

The prophet of whom Turalyon spoke of is undoubtedly the leader of the [[draenei]], [[Velen]]. Take the object and journey to [[the Exodar]]. It is there that you will find Prophet Velen.

I will open a portal for you now. Take my beacon and use it when you are ready to return.

You will also receive:
*{{cost|77|60}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*[[Draenic Wooden Wall Shelf]]

==Completion==
[[Kil'jaeden]] took the child from [[Velen]], let Velen believe that the boy had been killed, then raised the child as an agent of the [[Burning Legion]] with the express purpose of murdering his own father? That bastard waited 13,000 years to exact vengeance upon Velen for defying [[Sargeras]] and the Legion? The Deceiver indeed...

For Velen to have to experience such tragedy after what he and his people have already been through is heartbreaking. Such a thing would test anyone's faith.

==Notes==
[[File:WorldMap-AzuremystIsleScenario.jpg|thumb|World map.]]
On accept:
: ''A portal appears and Khadgar points to it.''
: {{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|This portal will take you to the Exodar. Good luck, <class hall title>.}}

The portal leads to a phased version of [[the Exodar]], beginning a [[scenario]].

===Stage 1: The Prophet and the Butcher===
* Seek out [[Prophet Velen]] in the [[Vault of Lights]].

:{{text|yell|Prophet Velen|We make our last stand at the Vault of Lights! If you can make your way here you will find sanctuary, although I cannot say for how long...}}
:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|Did your visions foretell of this day, Prophet? Did you see our coming?}}
:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|I bring you a message from Kil'jaeden, to be served in the blood of your people! JUSTICE WILL BE MET!}}
:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|A coward's death to these traitorous "draenei!" Mar their corpses so the living may see the fate that awaits them!}}

[[High Vindicator]]s are fighting against [[Rakeeshi Honor Guard]]s.
*{{Text|say|High Vindicator|We will keep our monstrous brethren occupied, please hurry to the Vault of Lights! Our people need you!}}
*{{Text|say|High Vindicator|The Prophet is holding off the entire invasion at the Vault of Lights! He needs assistance!}}
*{{Text|say|High Vindicator|I don't know how much longer the Prophet can keep the barrier up. Time is of the essence!}}
*{{Text|say|High Vindicator|Quickly, hero, to the Vault of Lights!}}
*{{Text|say|High Vindicator|Many thanks, hero. You must hurry to the Vault of Lights. The Prophet awaits your arrival!}}

;Entering the Seat of the Naaru
:{{text|yell|Prophet Velen|Rakeesh... His name means "butcher" in [[Eredun]]. It is no coincidence that Kil'jaeden sent an [[eredar]] to slaughter my people. The Deceiver revels in his "creative" punishments for those that dare defy him.}}

;Citizens
*{{Text|say|If the Prophet's barrier falls we are all doomed!}}
*{{Text|say|They've finally found us...}}
*{{Text|say|We won't go down without a fight!}}
*{{Text|say|Save us!}}
*{{Text|say|Do you think my family is safe? I haven't seen them.}}
*{{Text|say|The Burning Legion are unrelenting.}}
*{{Text|say|Is this the end?}}
*{{Text|say|Light help us!}}

Upon approaching Velen:
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Fate has delivered you to us in this most dire time, hero! While I sense that your mission is urgent, if we do not push back these invading demons, we will all perish.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|This barrier protecting my people requires all of my energy and focus. I am afraid you must venture into the demon infested halls alone. Please, search for survivors and eliminate the Legion invasion point portals that you find across the Exodar.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|You must hurry. I do not know how much longer I can keep this barrier active!}}

===Stage 2: In Defense of the Exodar===
*Rescue terrified citizens found throughout the Exodar and destroy Legion fel portals.
* [[Terrified Exodar Citizen]]s rescued (12)
* [[Fel Portal (Exodar)|Fel Portals]] destroyed (8)

The [[Fel Annihilation]] bonus objective also becomes active.

:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|Break your bodies upon the prophet's barrier, minions! Soon it shall fall, and with it the hopes of the draenei!}}
:{{text|yell|Huk'roth the Huntmaster|Your will be done, master!}}

Upon destroying a portal:
:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|Your interference only delays the inevitable. Minions, destroy <him/her>!}}
:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|Send in the wrathlords at once! Stop these meddling insects!}}
:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|You foolishly stand in defiance of the endless armies of Sargeras! Sisters, bring me his head!}}

The citizens have these things to say when rescued:

:{{text|say|Terrified Exodar Citizen|Light bless you!}}
:{{text|say|Terrified Exodar Citizen|I was so scared! Those angry draenei are hurting everyone!}} (child)
:{{text|say|Terrified Exodar Citizen|Thank you, <class>! Without you I would have surely perished!}}
:{{text|say|Terrified Exodar Citizen|Have you seen my mommy?}} (child)
:{{text|say|Terrified Exodar Citizen|I can make it back on my own now. Your heroics have strengthened my resolve!}}
:{{text|say|Terrified Exodar Citizen|Have you seen my brother? I hope he made it to the prophet!}}

As you work on the portals, High Vindicators and [[Lightsworn Anchorite]]s come to your aid with [[Draenei War Banner]]s.

Rescued 12 citizens first:
:{{text|yell|Prophet Velen|Thanks to you, most of our people have returned safely to the Vault of Lights!  The time has come to focus your attention on the remaining fel portals and end Rakeesh's incursion!}}

Destroyed 8 portals first:
:{{text|yell|Prophet Velen|You have destroyed most of the fel portals, greatly hindering Rakeesh's ability to bring in reinforcements. Focus your attention on finding survivors now!}}

Also, during this stage, the optional quest [[Nobundo's Last Stand]] is available.

:{{text|yell|Farseer Nobundo|We have retreated into the collapsed shaft on the northern edge of the [[Crystal Hall]]. We are holding back the demon onslaught, but our defenses are quickly falling apart!}}

===Stage 3: Return to the Prophet===
*Return to Prophet Velen in the Vault of Lights.

:{{text|yell|Prophet Velen|Divinius, <class hall title> <name> has crushed the incursion. Now is the time to take the Chosen and finish off the leftover demonic taint within our halls. Secure the Exodar for our people once more!}}
:{{text|Divinius|As you command, Prophet!}}

Upon returning to Velen:

:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I fear we have but a moment, hero. Rakeesh is still here - somewhere - and he must be stopped if my people are to find peace again.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I know that you have ventured far to find me and have brought with you a dire message.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|In your possession is an object of great importance. May I see it?}}

===Stage 4: The Light's Heart===
* Let Prophet Velen examine the [[:Mysterious Lightbound Object]].

Upon interacting with Velen:

:Please, show me what you have brought. We haven't much time.

:{{Gossip|<Place the Mysterious Lightbound Object on the ground.>}}

::{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Mother of Light! I... I am sorry. I did not know.}}
::{{text|say|Prophet Velen|<Class hall title> <name>, we have to go. NOW!}}
::{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I will explain on the way there. Inform me when you are prepared to leave, but please hurry.}}

===Stage 5: A Long Way Down===
* Speak to Prophet Velen, then escort him to the [[Seat of the Naaru]].

Upon interacting with Velen:

:Are you prepared to save [[O'ros]] from Rakeesh and uncover the secrets held within Light's Heart?

:{{Gossip|I'm ready, Velen!}}

Velen will start running towards the [[Seat of the Naaru]]. Follow him.

:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|What you have brought to me is known as Light's Heart. It is the sentience core of the naaru prime: [[Xe'ra]].}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Locked away within the core is wisdom... knowledge crucial to our battle against the Burning Legion.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Yet only a naaru born of Xe'ra is capable of unlocking the core. This is why you were sent here, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|And this is the true purpose of the Burning Legion's invasion of the Exodar.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|The last of Xe'ra's line, [[O'ros]], sits unguarded in the heart of the Exodar. If they destroy O'ros, the information within Light's Heart will be lost forever.}}

Velen reaches the beginning of the ramp down to O'ros, which is covered in fel taint. Do not run ahead of him! If you do, the floor will kill you very quickly.

:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|For a prophet you are doing a very poor job of making predictions...}}
:{{text|yell|O'ros|*O'ros emits a bitter melody*}}
:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|HAH! It makes music when you beat it! What a delightful creature! I will enjoy ending its existence.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Light damn him!}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I will guide us to the heart of the vessel. Stay within my protective barrier as I cleanse the fel taint from the pathway.}}

Velen floats up and starts clearing the path for you. Again, do not run ahead of him, though there is no pressing need to keep up with him, either.

:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|We have made it in time! By the grace and glory of the Light, I will heal O'ros. Then we will deal with Rakeesh.}}
:''Velen channels a spell, removing the beams of fel energy surrounding O'ros.''
:{{text|yell|Prophet Velen|You have lost, Rakeesh! O'ros is renewed and now you must answer for the atrocities you have committed!}}
:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|Ah, the fated heroes have arrived. It would appear that you have bested me, Velen.}}
:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|But before I surrender and face the judgment of the Light there is one last thing I must do.}}
:''A large [[Fel Annihilator]] appears. Rakeesh enters it and destroys O'ros.''
:{{text|yell|O'ros|*O'ros lets loose a woeful dirge as he is disintegrated*}}
:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|Can you know victory without first knowing defeat? Come. Fail. Die.}}

===Final Stage: Revelations===
* Defeat [[High General Rakeesh]]

Your first two [[Class Hall]] champions run down the ramp, joining you and Velen.

:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|We attack on your mark, <name>. Lead the charge!}}
:''The first champion follows with an introduction line, which varies depending on your class.''

{{ClassIcon|Death Knight}}
:''[[Nazgrim]] and [[Thassarian]] appear.''
:{{Text|say|Thassarian|Deathlord, please forgive our tardiness! Nazgrim insisted on strangulating every demon we ran across. Sir, I won't lie... I'm having second thoughts about him.}}

{{ClassIcon|Demon Hunter}}
:''[[Altruis the Sufferer]] / [[Kayn Sunfury]] and [[Asha Ravensong]] appear.''
:{{Text|say|Altruis / Kayn|Apologies for our late arrival, Slayer. The demons foolishly attempted to block out path, and we made them suffer in return!}}

{{ClassIcon|Druid}}
:''[[Naralex]] and [[Zen'tabra]] appear.''
:{{Text|say|Naralex|We sensed that you might be in distress, Archdruid. Together, we shall strike this demon down!}}

{{ClassIcon|Hunter}}
:''[[Emmarel Shadewarden]] and [[Loren Stormhoof]] appear.''
:{{Text|say|Emmarel Shadewarden|You left in quite a hurry, Huntsmaster. We went to great lengths to track down your location. Thankfully we found you in time!}}

{{ClassIcon|Mage}}
:''[[Archmage Modera]] and [[Kalecgos]] appear.''
:{{Text|say|Kalecgos|Already getting into trouble, Archmage? Hopefully we can be of service!}}

{{ClassIcon|Monk}}
:''[[Chen Stormstout]] and [[Li Li Stormstout]] (and a Cloud Serpent 106792) appear.''
:{{Text|say|Chen Stormstout|We have arrived, Grandmaster, and brought with us good brew and an overly positive attitude!}}

{{ClassIcon|Rogue}}
:''[[Garona Halforcen]] and [[Vanessa VanCleef]] appear.''
:{{Text|say|Garona Halforcen|Rumors of your death are greatly exaggerated, Shadowblade. They said the demons got you. We came to make sure.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|There is still a chance.}}

{{ClassIcon|Paladin}}
:''[[Lady Liadrin]] and [[Lord Maxwell Tyrosus]] appear.''
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|Reporting for duty, Highlord. Prophet, it has been ages since we last saw each other. Unfortunate circumstances for our reunion, but hopefully the outcome will be in our favor!}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|You have taken well to the Light, Liadrin! It would seem that the Sunwell has renewed your vigor!}}

{{ClassIcon|Priest}}
:''[[Calia Menethil]] and [[High Priestess Ishanah]] appear.''
:{{Text|say|High Priestess Ishanah|High Priest <name>, we came as soon as we heard! Thank you for saving my people! Through the light we will be victorious!}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Light be praised. It is good to see you, Ishanah.}}

{{ClassIcon|Shaman}}
:''[[Duke Hydraxis]] and [[Stormcaller Mylra]] appear.''
:{{Text|say|Stormcaller Mylra|<Lad/Lass>, why would ya go off on your own without us? Do ya know how hard it is to get to this bumble-fudged island without a mage's portal?}}

{{ClassIcon|Warlock}}
:''[[Calydus]] and [[Ritssyn Flamescowl]] appear.''
:{{Text|say|Ritssyn Flamescowl|This imbecile, Calydus, insisted I bring him along. I refused. He followed me anyway. Let's get this over with before I lose my patience and incinerate him.}}
:{{text|say|Prophen Velen|This is awkward.}}

{{ClassIcon|Warrior}}
:''[[Finna Bjornsdottir]] and [[Ragnvald Drakeborn]] appear.''
:{{Text|say|Finna Bjornsdottir|Little hero, we have come to fight and die alongside you! Or we could win I suppose. Either way, we have come to fight!}}

Upon engaging Rakeesh:
:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|In my master's house smolder the burning husks of a thousand worlds. I am here now to prepare a place for you amidst the ruin of tomorrow.}}

Upon dropping Rakeesh to 30% health, he retreats and starts casting "Gift of Argus".

:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|You think you've won? You will know the taste of defeat, even if it means my own death!}}
:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|From the mouth of Argus comes your doom! For soon the annihilator will have its fill and detonate with the force of a collapsing star! Nothing but ash will be left where we stand!}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|No, this is all wrong. I... I have been here before, but that would mean...}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|IT CANNOT BE!}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Heroes we mustn't kill Rakeesh! Stop! Please!}}
:{{text|yell|High General Rakeesh|It will be your faces that I see in my last waking moments. A final agonizing memory before I am turned to ash and cast into oblivion. I welcome it...}}
:{{text|say|Class Hall Champion|He's left us no choice, Velen! If we don't destroy the machine this place and every living soul inside will be annihilated!}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|If you will not spare him then I must stop you!}}

At this point, if you haven't brought Rakeesh down to 0 health already, Velen will attack you, though he does low damage.

After Rakeesh dies, Velen approaches him, kneels before him, and lifts him by his head.

:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|You asked me if I foresaw this day, child.}}
:{{text|say|Class Hall Champion|What's wrong with the prophet?}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I... I did... And until this moment I did not understand.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|In a time that is now just a whisper of a memory, I had a son. On the day of his birth, a vision came to me.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|In that vision I saw myself weeping as I held a dying eredar in my arms. His skin fel-pocked and battle-scarred.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Like yours...}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|But I buried that vision after Kil'jaeden took my family from me, and for eons let it be lost in the darkest recesses of my being.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Now, finally, as I hold you in my arms, I understand.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|There is nothing left here for you, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Take Light's Heart and return to Khadgar. Tell him... Tell him that the Light died here this day.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Farewell.}}

Use [[Khadgar's Beacon]] to teleport back to Dalaran. Shortly after the beacon begins casting, the [[Light's Chosen]] run in. (The following dialog continues beyond the cast time, and will require canceling the cast to be seen in full.)
:{{text|say|Divinius|We came as soon as we were able! Thank the Light that you are safe, prophet!}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|I am neither prophet nor pawn. Not any longer.}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Did Romuul survive?}}
:{{text|say|Divinius|[[Grand Artificer Romuul]] yet lives, sir!}}
:{{text|say|Prophet Velen|Good. Find Romuul. Tell him to begin repairs on the vessel. We are going home.}}
