==Objectives==
Craft a [[:Handcrafted Silkweave Robe]] on Tanithria's Finishing Bench{{sic}}.  You can find the pattern in your tailoring pattern list.  You can find the materials for the pattern in her shop.
*[[Tanithria's Red Dye]] (Optional)
*[[Tanithria's Purple Dye]] (Optional)
*[[Tanithria's Thread]] (Optional)
*[[Tanithria's Silkweave]] (20)
* Craft a Silkweave Robe at [[Tanithria's Finishing Table]]

==Description==
I have plenty of silk patterns that we can put this cloth to work on.

Help me to prepare the materials, <name>.  We're going to put this cloth to good use and make you a new robe.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*{{Abilities|Introduction to Silkweaving|id=186017|icon=trade_tailoring}}

You will receive:
* 15,050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We're back in business again.  How exciting!

==Completion==
That's a shame.  Without the ability to do any stitching, we can hardly do anything with this fabric.

<Tanithria pouts.>

Still, there ARE patterns we know that don't require stitching.  Shoulderpads are easy, and belts should be a cinch.
