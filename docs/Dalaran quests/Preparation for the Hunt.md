==Objectives==
Speak to [[Apata Highmountain]] at [[Krasus' Landing]] in [[Dalaran]].

==Description==
[[:Talonclaw]] is a mighty spear indeed! I first set eyes upon it when the [[Highmountain tauren]] led the members of [[Unseen Path|my order]] up to [[Talon Peak]] to found the [[Trueshot Lodge]].

But such tales must wait for another time.

Apata has been in Dalaran gathering supplies for her expedition. I imagine she's ready to depart by now.

Seek her out at Krasus' Landing. I know she will be eager to begin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94}}
*1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My brother [[Wuho Highmountain|Wuho]] and I will be honored to have you on this quest, <name>. Talonclaw is a sacred artifact to my people, and I know with your help we will recover it.

We just have to do one thing before we head out, speak with the [[Ohn'ahra|Eagle Spirit]].
