'''Radiant Warnings''' concludes the Hunt for the Harbinger chapter of the [[Dark Heart campaign]], added in [[patch 10.2.7]].

==Objectives==
Deliver [[Locus-Walker]]'s warning to [[Khadgar]] in [[Dalaran]].
* Listen to Locus-Walker
* Return to Khadgar in Dalaran

==Description==
So she goes by Harbinger now, does she? How fitting.

I no longer feel her presence, but make no mistake. [[Xal'atath]]'s nefarious games continue. And [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] is now a pawn upon her board.

As are you, champion of fate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|80|90}}
* [[Winding Slitherdrake: Void Scales]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]
* [[Hunt the Harbinger]]

==Progress==
Telogrus Rift should no longer tempt Xal'atath. For now.

==Completion==
The Harbinger is Xal'atath? And she's already attacked [[Telogrus Rift]].

This is most serious, <name>. I'm afraid we have no more time for investigations.

If Locus-Walker is right, the answer will lie within the [[Radiant Song]]. We must discover what it means.

==Notes==
Speak with Locus-Walker again:
{{Dialogue|
I have much to discuss with you both.

About Xal'atath, now named Harbinger. And about this Radiant Song heard all across [[Azeroth]].

{{gossip|quest=|{{text|rare|(Play Scene)}} I'm ready.}}}}

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-game cinematic]] plays:

{{#ev:youtube|_XxPjokjwL4|urlArgs=start=3&end=97}}

{{text|bossemote|Locus-Walker|So it is Xal'atath who has claimed the [[Dark Heart]]...}}

{{text|bossemote|Locus-Walker|I understand now why she calls herself the Harbinger.}}

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|I've had enough riddles for one day...}}

{{text|bossemote|Locus-Walker|The radiant visions you spoke of are the very same [[ethereal|my people]] had...}}

{{text|bossemote|Locus-Walker|...before [[K'aresh|our world]] was consumed by the [[void lord|Void Lord]] [[Dimensius]].}}

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|What?! You don't think...}}

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Could Xal'atath be seeking that same fate for Azeroth?}}

{{text|bossemote|Locus-Walker|I fear that is precisely what she intends.}}

{{text|bossemote|Locus-Walker|You... must find a way to stop her.}}

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Me? Look, she knew exactly how to hurt me.}}

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|I don't think I'm the one to...}}

{{text|bossemote|Locus-Walker|Yes, she knew your greatest fear is endangering your family.}}

{{text|bossemote|Locus-Walker|But you must let go of that fear.}}

{{text|bossemote|Locus-Walker|Embrace who you truly are.}}

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|I know who I am.}}

{{text|bossemote|Locus-Walker|Do you? You are unbalanced.}}

{{text|bossemote|Locus-Walker|You must master your unique nature, Alleria.}}

{{text|bossemote|Locus-Walker|If you cannot... then Azeroth is already doomed.}}

After the cinematic:
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|It's best if I leave. I'm a danger to you all, so long as Xal'atath's gaze is cast upon me.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Tell Khadgar what we learned. I will return to Dalaran in time.}}
:''Alleria walks off.''

Locus-Walker has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
My first and most troublesome student. Perhaps one day Alleria will see reason.

Let us just hope it's not too late by then.

{{gossip|{{text|rare|(Play Scene)}} Tell me your warning once more.}}

{{gossip|Why have you chosen to teach the [[void elf|ren'dorei]] about the [[Void]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Your question is not without merit. Long ago, I chose to teach Alleria about the ways of the Void. But she had proven herself worthy of such lessons with my rescue from the [[Burning Legion|Legion]].

Perhaps I merely wish to sate my own curiosity. And Telogrus Rift and the ren'dorei are both quite the curiosities, aren't they?

{{Gossip|Tell me about something else.}}}}}}

Take the Void Rifts to hop-scotch across the Telogrus Rift back to the northern end, where a [[Rift to Dalaran]] awaits.

Before taking it, speak with [[Magister Umbric]], surrounded by the five [[Riftwalkers]]:
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|
Further understanding of the Void is the only way to protect Azeroth against the shadows. And so our studies continue.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|
*{{text|say|Magister Umbric|Alleria reported her findings regarding the strange phenomenon you have all been investigating.}}
*{{text|say|Magister Umbric|We now believe the Dark Heart is capable of drawing in magical power and converting it to shadow.}}
*{{text|say|Magister Umbric|Your orders have not changed, however. You will still be responding to unusual void activity.}}
*{{text|say|[[Riftwalker Dellyn]]|Will Lady Windrunner be leading further investigations?}}
*{{text|say|Magister Umbric|Ah. I'm afraid she's... indisposed with her own mission at the moment.}}
*{{text|say|[[Riftwalker Soran]]|Telogrus needs her. She's supposed to guide us.}}
*{{text|say|Magister Umbric|Alleria will return to us in time. But for now, you may seek Locus-Walker for guidance.}}
*{{text|say|Magister Umbric|We ren'dorei do not have an easy path. The whispers shall always tempt us. Threaten to consume us.}}
*{{text|say|Magister Umbric|Entire [[world]]s can be destroyed by the power of the Void.}}
*{{text|say|Magister Umbric|But it also allows us to protect Azeroth in a way no other can. To defend our home against the dark.}}}}}}

Return to Khadgar in Dalaran, and [[Jaina Proudmoore]] has returned:
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Still no word from [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni]]?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|No. The Speaker of [[Azeroth (titan)|Azeroth]] remains strangely silent.}}

Before turning in, Jaina has gossip:
{{Dialogue|Khadgar told me that he sent you and Alleria to investigate the Dark Heart. Glad to know we have our best on the case.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Xal'atath has returned as the Harbinger. And now she has the power of the Dark Heart at her disposal.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|It's all connected to the Radiant Song. It has to be.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Locus-Walker said the [[ethereal]]s heard a similar song before K'aresh was destroyed.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Then is... Azeroth herself the one in danger? Is she speaking to us?}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|We need answers. We need her Speaker.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I will seek out Magni. But first, I must inform [[Thrall]] of what we learned here.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|We must face this crisis together. [[Horde]] and [[Alliance]] both.}}

Upon complete, both Jaina and Khadgar have new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Jaina Proudmoore|
It seems your investigation bore more fruit than mine did.

I've been questioning those who claimed to see the Radiant Vision. Trying to understand what it could all mean. But there seemed to be no connection between those who were seeing it. Nor did anyone understand what it meant.

Could Locus-Walker be right? Is it a warning from the Azeroth herself? We need the [[Worldsoul]]'s Speaker. I must speak with Magni.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Archmage Khadgar|
Jaina and I have much to discuss about your investigation.

You are free to join us, if you wish.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}} (''repeats the on-complete text'')

{{gossip|Can you tell me more about Xal'atath and her role as Harbinger?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
We now know that The Harbinger is Xal'atath, a being of the Void. Her spirit was once trapped within [[Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|a dagger]], but she was recently released onto Azeroth. And it seems she means to make the most of her freedom.

Xal'atath has allied herself with [[Iridikron]] and gained a powerful relic, the Dark Heart. There's now strong evidence that she is using this relic, but we know not to what ends. She has also gained a force of void spawn. She used this force to attack Telogrus Rift, which you and Alleria luckily defended against.

However, we still do not know exactly what the Dark Heart is capable of. And now, with what we know of the Radiant Song, I fear for the worst...

{{gossip|Locus-Walker gave us a warning about the Radiant Song.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Locus-Walker claims that his people, the ethereals, once had a vision similar to the Radiant Song that many across Azeroth are currently witnessing. However, this vision came shortly before their world was destroyed by the Void Lord Dimensius.

Does this mean the Radiant Song is a warning of imminent destruction? Perhaps a warning from the very Worldsoul of Azeroth. And I cannot help but fear it has something to do with Xal'atath and her Dark Heart.

We need the wisdom of Azeroth's Speaker, but Magni has yet to answer our calls. Jaina as agreed to seek him out, once she has spoken with Thrall. I wouldn't be surprised if she eventually requested your help on the manner, <name>.
