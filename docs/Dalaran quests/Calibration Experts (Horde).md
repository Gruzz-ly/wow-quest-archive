==Objectives==
Take the Uncalibrated Malloric Burettes to skilled alchemists for calibration.
* Consult [[Emmara Marie]]
* Consult [[Jana Winterhoof]]
* Consult [[Tryks Pourtrue]]
* [[Uncalibrated Malloric Burettes]] (provided)

==Description==
It will take the cooperation of several highly skilled sorts to calibrate these burettes for a variety of substances.

Chemist Emmara is an old friend from the [[Undercity]] who has helped me with similar endeavors.

[[Thunder Bluff]] smells like a barn to me, but Jana Winterhoof is an [[alchemist]] with exacting standards.

And while I'd never travel to [[Booty Bay]] without a lock on my wallet, Tryks Pourtrue has proven reliable and fair.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
{{Stub-section}}

==Completion==
Yes, I'd say these burettes look well-calibrated.

I knew those three would be meticulous. Never underestimate the value of someone who obsesses over tiny details, <name>!
