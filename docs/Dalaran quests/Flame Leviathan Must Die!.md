Kill [[Flame Leviathan]].

This quest can be completed with any difficulty or size raid.
* [[Flame Leviathan]] slain

== Description ==
Within the [[Formation Grounds]] sits [[Ulduar]]'s first line of defense: Flame Leviathan.

The [[Kirin Tor]] have been provided with information suggesting that this Keeper-created machine is soon to be transported to an undisclosed location and let loose to wreak havoc upon the mortals of [[Azeroth]].

This must not come to pass. The [[Council of Six]] has decreed that Flame Leviathan must die! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|29|60}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor]]

== Progress ==
Why is Flame Leviathan not in pieces?

== Completion ==
I never cease to be amazed by the horrors that can be created through the use of technology.

==Patch changes==
