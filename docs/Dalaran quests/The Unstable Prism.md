==Objectives==
Deliver the [[Frigid Timewarped Prism]] to [[Auzin|an interested mage]] in [[Dalaran]].

==Description==
As the prism struggles to stabilize in a single time flow, it bleeds a shadowy chill, the likes of which you haven't felt since Northrend. Surely some mage in Dalaran would be interested in this relic.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*500 [[Timewarped Badge]]

==Completion==
Let me see that.

<Auzin ponders the prism for a while, before turning back to you.>

Hmm... [[Cupri]] could run tests on this for an eternity. This certainly qualifies as further evidence of meddling by a third party... or is it a sixth party...

Do you mind if I keep it?

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2024-10-07|bluenote=Now rewards 200 badges for repeat completions. As before, it rewards 500 badges the first time on your account.}}
