==Objectives==
Find [[Navarrogg]] at the [[Misty Coast]] in [[Highmountain]].

==Description==
The [[Highmountain Tribe|Highmountain]] have passed along a dire warning from their [[drogbar]] allies. The [[Bloodtotem tribe|Feltotem]] are spreading their demonic corruption into the wildlife around them, infecting the land itself. We believe this is something that should be looked into sooner rather than later.

The drogbar chieftain, Navarrogg, is handling this personally and we'd like you to meet him near the Feltotem village.
