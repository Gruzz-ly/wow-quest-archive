==Objectives==
Borrow a Rune of Portals from [[Archmage Celindra]].
* [[Rune of Portals]]
* Rune of Portals delivered

==Description==
A rune of portals?! Who does [[Val'zuun]] think he is?

<[[Valeera Sanguinar|Valeera]] takes a deep breath.>

It's worth the price, but those runes aren't exactly easy to come by. Unless...

Archmage Celindra, the [[Kirin Tor]]'s portal master, has a study in the center of town. We [[rogue]]s aren't particularly welcome there, nor would she simply hand a rune over even if we were...

<Valeera smirks.>

But who said anything about asking?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (level 100)
* 15,050 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Progress==
They say the [[Fangs of the Devourer]] have no equal. If that's true, they're worth any price.

==Completion==
Val'zuun actually kept his end of the bargain... I'm impressed.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|Stay in the shadows to avoid detection. The Kirin Tor are no fools.}}

At the [[Violet Gate]], Celindra has summoned several [[Arcane Sentry|Arcane Sentries]] to ward against intruders. While Celindra herself is patrolling back and forth in the room, [[Warcaster Fanoraithe]] in the southern corner is calling down frost bolts with "Revealing Blizzard" and [[Jessa Weaver]] in the northern corner is summoning "Revealing Flames" on the floor.
:{{text|say|Archmage Celindra|My wards detected someone entering the study. Find them at once!}}

If you approach Fanoraither or Jessa, they will say the following:
:{{text|say|Warcaster Fanoraithe|I heard it, too, Archmage. I will expel them at once!}}
:{{text|say|Jessa Weaver|I definitely heard something. Don't worry, Archmage, I'll find them.}}
If you are detected by the archmage or one of her elementals or hit by Fanoraithe or Jessa's spells, you will be instantly teleported back out and rooted in place with "Runic Binding" for 3 seconds. The teleporting mage (be it Celindra, Fanoraithe or Jessa) will also say one of the following:
*{{text|say|There you are!}}
*{{text|say|Reveal yourself!}}
:{{text|bossemote|You've been detected!}}

Use [[Stealth]] to sneak past them into the small room in the center and loot the [[Rune of Portals]]. Then, head back to the [[Underbelly Descent]] to find Val'zuun and a crouching, stealthed Valeera. Hand in the rune to Val'zuun to complete the quest objective.
:What brings you to this lawless place?
:{{gossip|<Hand the Rune of Portals to Val'zuun.>}}
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|Excellent... you will find [[Akaari Shadowgore|Akaari]] in the [[Legerdemain Lounge]].}}
