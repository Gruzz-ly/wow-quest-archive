==Objectives==
Continue following [[Lyndras]]' trail.

==Description==
[[Flitz]] mentioned a manhole near [[Violet Hold]], perhaps that would be the best place to pick up Lyndras' trail.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The trail ended at [[Linzy Blackbolt|Linzy]]'s ley flame burner, lying in pieces upon the ground.

There are too many guards around for this to have gone unnoticed. Perhaps they have some information about Lyndras.

==Notes==
In the street on the ground there are [[Ley Dust Trail]]s.
