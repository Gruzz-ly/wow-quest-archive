'''Luminous Pearl''' starts the short quest chain to acquire the fishing artifact, the [[Underlight Angler]]. After completing [[Bigger Fish to Fry]] by fishing up all of the rare Legion fish, a [[Luminous Pearl]] can be fished up from any school or open water fishing on the [[Broken Isles]].

==Objectives==
Bring the Luminous Pearl to [[Archmage Khadgar]] in [[Dalaran]].
*[[Luminous Pearl]]

==Description==
Balanced upon your fishing hook, you find a pearl unlike any other you've seen before. It shines with a cold, steady light, and its size and weight fluctuate in your hand.

This is clearly a magical item, and should be brought to a magical person.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A pearl, you say? Well now, let me have a good look at that...
