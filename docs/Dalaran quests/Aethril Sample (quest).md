==Objectives==
Bring the Aethril Sample to [[Kuhuine Tenderstride]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Aethril Sample]]

==Description==
This herb has clearly been absorbing [[magic]]al energy from the land. Filaments of [[Ley line|ley energy]] course from root to leaf.

Your herbalism trainer in Dalaran will want to see this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
From the look of it, I would expect such an herb to be fragile and delicate, but... it's quite sturdy.

Oooh, look at these!
