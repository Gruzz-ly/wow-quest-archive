==Objectives==
Reinforce 5 magical barriers.
* Talk to [[Khadgar]] (Optional)
* [[Magical Barrier|Magical barriers]] reinforced
*Meet Momentus at the Obliterum Forge in the Magus Commerce Exchange.

==Description==
The citizens of [[Dalaran]] have sequestered themselves behind magical barriers that will keep the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] at bay, for now. However, the power of the barriers is not infinite.

Take my Reinforcing Ring and reinforce the barriers in order to keep our people safe. That will free me up to investigate the source of this Legion invasion.

Once you're done, keep culling the Legion's numbers. I'll contact you once I've discovered more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||20}}
*2,150 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Progress==
Reinforcing the magical barriers should hold the Legion at bay until Khadgar can get this situation sorted out.

==Completion==
I think this is magnificent!

You're the perfect control group to test our theories on the importance of artifacts in the grand scheme of the flow of timelines.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|The spell we cast was supposed to banish the Legion's forces from Dalaran before it was teleported to the Broken Isles.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|I don't know what went wrong, or how the Legion was able to breach our defenses, but we must retake the city.}}

Speak with Khadgar:
{{dialogue|It always seems darkest before the dawn, doesn't it, <name>?

{{gossip|quest=|What happened, Khadgar?}}

I still do not know.

Something went wrong with our spell.

Instead of banishing the Legion forces across Azeroth and abjuring them from Dalaran upon our arrival, somehow they slipped inside.

I aim to discover how that came to pass, and whatever, or whoever, is responsible.

{{gossip|quest=|Then I'll buy Dalaran the time you need.}}}}

:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|If we don't reinforce the buildings' barriers, then the civilians hiding inside will be left defenseless.}}

Speaking with Khadgar again:

{{dialogue|Dalaran will not fall. Not while I still draw breath.}}

[[Magical Barrier]]s are all over Dalaran, in the same places as in [[Mean Streets of Dalaran]]. Interact with five:
:{{text|say|Moratari|I've discovered why you have amnesia! When you entered this timeline, you took the place of "another you," a hero of vast renown.}}
:{{text|say|Moratari|So, you have some big shoes to fill. But [[Momentus]] can help you live up to your own legend! Find him at the [[Obliterum Forge]].}}

At the Obliterum Forge are Momentus and [[Erus]]:
:{{text|say|Momentus|<Name>! Moratari let me know what's going on. Let's get to work!}}

Speak with him:
{{dialogue|Reinforcing the magical barriers has bought us plenty of time against the Legion to figure out exactly what's going on with you.

<Momentus scrutinizes you from toes to nose.>

Hmmm.

As I suspected.

{{gossip|quest=|Suspected? Suspected what? What do you see?}}

<Momentus leans back, satisfied with his inspection.>

As Moratari has told you, this timeline has quite a few holes in it. The you-of-this-timeline stepped through one of them and swapped places with you.

In short, you are you, but... different.

{{gossip|quest=|Different? I don't feel different.}}

The you-of-this-timeline has accomplished deeds beyond your imagination and the people of this timeline owe much to them.

They are a mighty hero.

You have quite the legend to live up to, <name>.

{{plainlist|
* {{gossip|quest=|That's concerning.}}
* {{gossip|quest=|That's encouraging.}}
* {{gossip|quest=|That's depressing.}}
* {{gossip|quest=|That's irrelevant.}}}}

There are few problems that a little heat and a hammer cannot solve.}}

:{{text|say|Momentus|If you're going to play the hero, then you'll need a powerful artifact weapon from this timeline.}}
:{{text|say|Momentus|I can pluck one from its current time and place for you, but I'll need a few reagents to cast the spell.}}
