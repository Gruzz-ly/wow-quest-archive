* [[Blood of Sargeras]]
* [[Kaldorei Ginger Wine]] (5)
* [[Moist Azsunian Feta]] (5)

==Description==
I may have what you're looking for, burettes you say? Not a very common item.

For that, I require a moderate favor. Nothing too big, just a few things really.

A silver hair from a [[Khadgar|high-ranking]] [[archmage]]... the blood of a [[titan]], and, oh... some wine and cheese.

What?! I have appetites that need satiating.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't take too long now. Who knows who else may be in [[Black Market (Dalaran)|the market]] for your precious burettes.

==Completion==
You got the hair?!

<Ms. Xiulan laughs audibly.>

Oh, I wish I could have been there to see the look on his face. Nevertheless, a deals a deal.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Ms. Xiulan
:{{Gossip|How in the light am I supposed to get a hair from an archmage?!}}
::Judging by what you're asking for I assume you're an alchemist?

::And if that's true, isn't there some sort of invisibility potion you can brew Skaggldrynk I believe it's called.

::He'll never see you coming.

On your way to Khadgar stop by [[Fialla Sweetberry]] and buy [[Kaldorei Ginger Wine]] and [[Moist Azsunian Feta]].

;Khadgar's hair
Drink [[Skaggldrynk]] and speak with [[Archmage Khadgar]] in the [[Violet Citadel]].

:{{gossip|Carefully pluck a single strand of hair from Khadgar's head.}}
:{{text|yell|Archmage Khadgar|OW!! What in the light was that?!}}
:{{text|say|[[Archmage Modera]]|Khadgar, what's wrong? What happened?}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Something... bit my head I think.}}
:{{text|say|Archmage Modera|Something bit your head? That's all? Would you like me to kiss it for you?}}
:''Modera blows a kiss at Khadgar.''
