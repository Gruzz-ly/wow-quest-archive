==Objectives==
Collect Frayed Temporal Threads from the streets of [[Dalaran]].
*[[Frayed Temporal Thread]]s collected (12)

==Description==
To get you an [[artifact]] we'll need some temporal energy.

Normally we use infinite cloaks woven from temporal threads, but those threads are frayed in this timeline. So instead I need you to gather those frayed temporal threads from around Dalaran.

You can find them popping into and out of existence here and there. They look like radiant golden orbs of power, you can't miss them.

Once you have enough of them bring them back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||20}}
*1,750 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Progress==
With this source of power Momentus should have what he needs to help you get an artifact.

==Completion==
These threads contain traces of potential epoch energy. To access their power we'll need to infuse them into a stabilizing material, such as infinite bronze, in order to anchor them in place.

They'll lose some of their potency, but at least they will be sufficient for our needs.

==Notes==
Frayed Temporal Threads are small motes of bronze all over the city.

Upon completion of [[Thrift]] and [[Threadbare]]:
:{{text|say|Momentus|Ah, you're back! Now to forge some infinite bronze from what you've collected.}}
