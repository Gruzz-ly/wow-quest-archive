==Objectives==
Meet with Brann in [[Suramar]].

==Description==
<Name>! I just heard that [[Brann Bronzebeard]] - that crazy, [[titan]]-obsessed dwarf - has decided to go hunting for his precious disc in Suramar.

Talk about the last place you'd want to go digging around, given the [[Suramar storyline|current events]].

I'm sure he could use your help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
*1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There's [[demon]] stink all over this place. But there's also a lot of clues as to where a piece of the titan disc is!

==Progression==
#[[One Step Closer]]
#[[Deciphering Demonology]]
#[[Dark Secrets]]

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
