==Objectives==
Save [[Dalaran]].
* Return to the city
* Navigate the sewers
* Free webbed citizens (5)
* Enter the sewer grate
* Take the citizens to safety

==Description==
Follow me. We'll work together to find any others in need of rescuing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The [[nerubian]]s are capturing anyone they can and stringing them up in webs. Make sure to free whoever you find before moving on.

==Completion==
Looks like we saved who we could. Let's just hope the other rogues escaped.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|There could still be more survivors. With me, champion!}}

Follow Alleria back into the city. As she runs towards the [[Violet Hold]], a pillar falls from above, blocking the way.
:{{Text|Say|Alleria Windrunner|Damn it all! Cut through the sewers and find Khadgar. He'll know what to do.}}
