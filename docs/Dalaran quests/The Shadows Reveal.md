==Objectives==
Speak to your contacts in [[Dalaran]] to acquire intel on [[Akaari Shadowgore]]'s whereabouts.
* [[Desmond Gravesorrow]]'s intel
* [[Val'zuun]]'s intel
* [[Lucian Trias]]' intel
* [[Valeera's Note]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Fangs of the Devourer]] are wielded by Akaari Shadowgore, one of [[Kil'jaeden|Kil'Jaeden]]'s personal assassins. Every attempt on her life ends the same... she's gone before we even arrive.

<[[Valeera Sanguinar|Valeera]] scrawls a few lines on a piece of paper, then hands it to you.>

But not this time. We've been working with these contacts to find Akaari so we can finally take the Fangs for our own purposes.

Go to each contact and tell them "The shadows reveal." See what they know.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Progress==
Hmm?

==Completion==
<Valeera glances in your direction.>

Any luck?

==Notes==
Before accept:
:{{text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|We're finally closing in on her after all these years...}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|I'll meet you upstairs in [[Glorious Goods]] when you're done. Another one of [[Khadgar]]'s dogs has been nosing around, asking too many questions...}}

To find the informers, follow the directions given in [[Valeera's Note]]. Desmond Gravesorrow is found at a small camp in the small alley south of the [[Violet Citadel]]. However, by the time you arrive, he has been killed by a [[Shadowgore Darkcaster]]. Upon interacting with Desmond's body, you get the following text:
:Desmond seems to have crossed someone he shouldn't have.
:{{gossip|<Search the body for clues.>}}
::{{text|bossemote|There's nothing here.}}
[[Desmond's Lockbox]] nearby can be opened for 3 [[Thistle Tea]].

Val'zuun is sitting in the [[Underbelly Descent]] in the [[Underbelly]].
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|I was beginning to doubt you would come.}}
Upon speaking to him:
:What brings you to this lawless place?
*{{gossip|The shadows reveal.}}
*{{gossip|What are you exactly?}}

The second option is always available to all classes, but the first option is the one you need to select to progress in the quest. It will trigger the following dialogue:
:''Val'zuun stands up.''
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|It seems fate is on your side.}}
:''Val'zuun walks a few feet northwest and then stops.''
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|Akaari is in this very city as we speak, spying for her masters.}}
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|I will gladly tell you where... in exchange for a [[Rune of Portals|rune of portals]].}}
:''The [[eredar]] walks back to his previous position and sits back down.''
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|Until then, our business is complete.}}

Lucian Trias is found in [[One More Glass]], the wine, bread and cheese shop in the northeastern part of the city.
:I carry only the highest quality products.
:{{gossip|The shadows reveal.}}
::{{text|say|Lucian Trias|Nothing to share, I'm afraid. The wine gets people talking, but sometimes they just don't have anything useful to say.}}
::{{text|say|Lucian Trias|Say, care for some [[:Moist Azsunian Feta]] while you're here? It has a lovely tangy flavor!}}

Head back to Glorious Goods to find Valeera again.
