==Objectives==
Retrieve some Sabelite Sulfate from Heroic: [[Black Rook Hold]], craft a Flask of the Countless Armies and return both items to [[Alard Schmied|Alard]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Sabelite Sulfate]]
* [[Flask of the Countless Armies]]
*[[Dantalionax]] Slain

==Description==
The next ingredient on the list will supposedly add strength to the mix, according to [[Deucus Valdera|Deucus]]. I've heard of it before, but haven't really used it.

It's called Sabelite Sulfate, and it's said the [[night elf|elves]] of Black Rook Hold use it in their blacksmithing.

Something like that won't just be lying around. You may have to delve deep into the hold to find it.

And due to its weight, I made need a concoction of yours to compensate, something to give me a bit more strength.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I hope Deucus was right about these ingredients. This'll be the first time I'm making something like this.

==Completion==
<Alard takes the bag from you and peers inside.>

So this is the stuff? It's definitely true what I've heard. It is quite heavy.
