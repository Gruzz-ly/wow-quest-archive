==Description==
Due to the incredible volume of complaints in recent months we have been barred from delivering s... s...

<[[The Postmaster]] holds back tears, pain visible in his eyes.>

[[Solid stone]]. We're positively swimming in it - if we can't deliver it then pretty soon we will be overwh-

<The Postmaster's eyes light up suddenly.>

That's it!

There is an old [[Consortium]] portal not far from here that we could deposit it in with none the wiser!

Can you help, <name>? The stone is extraordinarily heavy.

You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

:{{text|say|The Postmaster|Katy, would you help <name> and go open the old Consortium portal by the [[Antonidas Memorial]]?}}
: ''Katy salutes.''
:{{text|say|[[Katy Stampwhistle]]|I'll meet you there!}}
: ''In two leaps Katy is wisked away by the exit Mail Tube.''

Grab a [[Sack of Solid Stone]] and head out.
* If you can fly, the fastest route would be to fly up and follow the top of the city wall.
* [[Druid]]s can speed things up with [[Displacer Beast]].
* [[Mage]]s' [[Blink]] works as usual.
* [[Hunter]]s' [[Disengage]] will work.
* [[Demon hunter]]s' [[Glide]] is not hindered by the sack.
* Another player can give you a ride with a two-seater mount.
* Likely the very best option is to use the [[Brulfist Idol]] toy to gain height, in conjunction with the [[Emerald Winds]] toy for distance.

;Arriving at the portal with the sack
:{{text|say|Katy Stampwhistle|I can't hold this forever! Do it!}}
:''The player uses the ability provided and tosses the sack into the portal. From the other side someone familiar responds.''
:{{text|say|[[Nexus-Prince Haramad]]|What's this? More of this blasted stone?!}}
:{{text|say|Nexus-Prince Haramad|You will pay for this, stranger. I will find you... and I will destroy you.}}
:{{text|say|Katy Stampwhistle|Oh my, that doesn't sound good. Go ahead and head back to The Postmaster - I'll dismantle this portal real quick.}}

;Completion
:{{text|say|The Postmaster|Pay Haramad no mind. Deep down I know he appreciates all of that free stone.}}
