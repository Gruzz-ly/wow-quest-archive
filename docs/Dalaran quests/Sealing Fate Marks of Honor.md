==Progress==
These seals provide an additional chance at treasure in dungeons and raids, but at what cost? Killing others isn't honorable, and yet you collect marks for honor? I suppose I can use those marks for an additional treasure. That is the offer I present.

Remember, you can only obtain three seals per week. This counts as one of those three. Next week, I will have others.

* Required items: [[Mark of Honor]] x5

==Rewards==
You will receive: [[Seal of Broken Fate]]
