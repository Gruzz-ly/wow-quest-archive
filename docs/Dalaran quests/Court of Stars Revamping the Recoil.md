==Objectives==
Go into the [[Court of Stars]] and recover the Arcanic Compressor for [[Hobart Grapplehammer|Hobart]].
* [[Arcanic Compressor]]
* [[Advisor Melandrus]] slain

==Description==
<Name>, you'll be very excited to hear that I've been working on a newer, better version of those goggles that [[Fargo Flintlocke|Flintlocke]] rigged up.

The ones I've designed have double the power, but unfortunately they also have double the recoil. I'm afraid if you use them, they'll break your neck.

But I found a solution. Deep inside [[Suramar City]] lies a magical mechanism that will reduce the recoil to practically nothing.

Recover that mechanism for me and we're in business!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Schematic: Semi-Automagic Cranial Cannon
|Schematic: Sawed-Off Cranial Cannon
|Schematic: Double-Barreled Cranial Cannon
|Schematic: Ironsight Cranial Cannon
}}

==Progress==
[[Nightborne|Those elves]] probably had no idea the quantum mechanical applications that mechanism has!

==Completion==
<Hobart takes the mechanism from you and begins tinkering with his design.>

Yes, I believe that's it. Good work, <name>.

As per usual I'll let you have a copy of my schematic for your personal gain.
