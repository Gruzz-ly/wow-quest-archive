Kill [[Malygos]].

* [[Malygos]] slain

== Description ==
Our resources are strained.  Malygos, the Spell-Weaver, is draining all of the [[magic]] out of the world, consolidating it in the [[Eye of Eternity]].  Without magic, we are doomed.

<Class>, the [[Nexus War]] must be brought to an end.  The [[Council of Six]] has decreed that Malygos must die! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|29|60}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor]]

== Progress ==
Malygos yet lives.  The [[Dragon Aspects|Aspect]] of Magic must die or the war is lost, <class>!

== Completion ==
With Malygos defeated, the Nexus War should come to a swift conclusion.  You have the gratitude of the [[Kirin Tor]], <name>.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 3.3.0|note=Added.}}
