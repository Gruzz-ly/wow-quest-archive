==Objectives==
Retrieve the Curious Simulacrum left in place of your "borrowed" artifact weapon by completing your artifact weapon's acquisition storyline as part of your Order Hall campaign.
* "Borrowed" artifact retrieved from your Order Hall campaign

==Description==
The artifact we snatched from the timeline earlier was replaced with a simulacrum so none would notice the true artifact's absence.

Such a wealth of infinite energy should not be abandoned so readily. You should seek it out and reclaim it.

Once you have recovered the simulacrum you can scrap it for an embarassing sum of bronze and infinite power.

==Rewards==
The end of this questline rewards:
: {{abilities|Heap of Bronze|Momentus put a simulacrum in place of your artifact weapon. Retrieve and scrap it for a large sum of bronze.|icon=inv_10_jewelcrafting_gem3primal_cut_bronze|id=1251776}}

You will receive:
*{{Cost|1|23}}
*1,700 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]
*[[Perfected Epoch Memento]] (once per account)

==Progress==
I can still smell the bronze used to make that simulacrum. Have you recovered it yet?

==Completion==
Success!

It's almost a shame to destroy such a beautiful replica.

But you have the real thing, so I say scrap it and rejoice at the bounty of beautiful bronze!

==Notes==
Proceed through the artifact acquisition storyline until getting the first artifact choice, then Momentus will step in:
:{{text|say|Momentus|Remember when I took your artifact from its proper time and place? I used the infinite bronze to craft a simulacrum to replace it.}}
:{{text|say|Momentus|If you were to retrieve it, Erus would scrap it for the materials we used in its creation.}}

In place of the actual artifact, players will loot the [[Curious Simulacrum]]. Use it:
:{{text|say|Momentus|Ah! The simulacrum I left in place of the artifact that I retrieved from the timeline.}}
:{{text|say|Momentus|Well, it's served its purpose and none are the wiser. Erus would be quite happy if you scrapped it to reclaim our materials.}}

Using the curious simulacrum turns it into the [[Bronze Simulacrum (item)]], which starts [[Bronze Simulacrum]].
