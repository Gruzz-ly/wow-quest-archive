==Objectives==
Talk to [[Khadgar]] in the [[Chamber of the Guardian]].

==Description==
Everything is unfolding splendidly, <name>. With your artifact in hand, you should have no issues assisting Khadgar in driving the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] fully from [[Dalaran]].

According to Moratari's calculations, he should have discovered the source of the Legion invasion. Return to the Chamber of the Guardian when you are ready and learn what he has discovered.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|1|23}}
*1,700 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Completion==
It has been a hard day, <name>, but our resolve is soon to be rewarded.

With the Legion distracted by your timely heroics, I was able to stretch out my arcane power and divine the mastermind behind the Legion incursion into our beloved city.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Momentus|Now that you have your artifact, it's time to be the hero you're meant to be. Report to Khadgar and save the day!}}

Return to Khadgar:
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|<Name>! I've discovered how we can expel the Legion from Dalaran!}}
