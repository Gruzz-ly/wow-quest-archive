==Objectives==
Join [[Valeera Sanguinar]] in the [[Underbelly Descent]].

==Description==
That lying [[demon]] SCUM! I should have known.

Let's show [[Val'zuun]] what happens to people who dare cross [[the Uncrowned]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}} (level 100)
* 1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
He's lying again, I know it... but he might be our only option.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|yell|Valeera Sanguinar|Val'zuun, I will be your death!}}
:''Valeera runs down the stairs.''

When you arrive at the Underbelly Descent, Valeera has cornered Val'zuun and made a mess of his alcove.
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|Stop! Stop! I did not know! I swear it!}}
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|I can still help you! I can take you to [[Akaari Shadowgore|Akaari]]'s stronghold!}}

Val'zuun has new gossip at this stage:
{{dialogue|Are you ready to begin?}}

==Trivia==
*{{text|yell|Val'zuun, I will be your death!}} is likely a reference to "I will be your death!", Valeera's "Threaten" emote in ''[[Hearthstone (game)|Hearthstone]]''.

==Progression==
{{Rogue artifact and class hall}}

==Patch changes==
