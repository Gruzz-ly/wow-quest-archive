'''The Prime Exchange''' is a bread crumb quest intended to get the player's attention. It is offered aboard the ''[[Vindicaar]]'' by [[Maras]], who is located on the bottom floor in the professions area.

==Completion==
As you've no doubt learned, [[:Primal Sargerite]] is a precious material which yields great power when infused with items. In our fight against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]], we need all the power we can get our hands on.

Bring me any Primal Sargerite you find and I will trade you what I can.
