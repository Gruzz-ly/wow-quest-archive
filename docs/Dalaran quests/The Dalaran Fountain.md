'''The Dalaran Fountain''' continues the short quest chain to acquire the [[fishing]] artifact, the [[Underlight Angler]].

==Objectives==
Bring the Luminous Pearl to the fountain in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Luminous Pearl]] (provided)

==Description==
You fished this up, did you? I'm... not quite sure what you want ME to do about that. Here.

<Khadgar pats you on the head.>

"Good job."

With regard to the pearl... it does seem to be magical, but I couldn't tell you much more than that. Perhaps it might look nice in the [[Dalaran fountain]]?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|19|40|}}

==Completion==
She's a BEAUTY! I've never seen the like!

Yeah yeah, sure, throw 'er in that fountain. [[Light]] knows people throw all sorts of other junk in there.

<The pearl glows brighter now, and moves to a spot above the water.>
