==Objectives==
Obtain the [[Fangs of the Devourer]] from [[Akaari Shadowgore]].
* Use the [[Twisted Gateway]]
* Fangs of the Devourer

==Description==
If you spare me I can use the [[Rune of Portals|rune of portals]] you provided to open a gateway to Akaari's citadel in the [[Twisting Nether]].

Of course, killing the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s master assassin in her own domain will be no simple feat, but surely the Fangs of the Devourer are worth the risk, no?

<Val'zuun smiles.>

I will guide you through the citadel once you arrive, but you will have to defeat Akaari on your own.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive: {{cost|14|60}}
|Gorefang
|Akaari's Will
}}
* 1,480 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Any luck?

==Completion==
I knew you'd succeed, <name>. I'm glad you're on our side.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Val'zuun stands up.''
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|Thank you for seeing reason.}}
:''Val'zuun walks a few feet northwest and begins casting a demonic spell.''
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|Ered'achor, shudas'urzul... kurai.}}
:''A [[Twisted Gateway]] appears in front of the [[eredar]].''
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|It is done. The way to [[Shadowgore Citadel]] is open.}}
:''Val'zuun walks back to his original position.''

Upon interacting with the gateway, you are transported to [[Shadowgore Citadel]] and placed in a single-player scenario.

===Stage 1: The Unseen Blade===
:''Engage Akaari Shadowgore while you have the element of surprise.''
*Engage Akaari Shadowgore

:{{text|say|Val'zuun|Akaari is just across the citadel from you. With your skill, you should be able to reach her undetected.}}

[[Shadowgore Bloodmaiden]]s and [[Shadowgore Stalker]]s are patrolling the citadel, while [[Shadowgore Darkcaster]]s are channeling spells. Two [[Eye of Xirus|Eyes of Xirus]] are patrolling the center ring. Their ability, "Sight Beyond Sight", allows them to detect [[stealth]]ed characters. If they fixate their gaze upon you for long enough, they will force you out of Stealth and inevitably cause several nearby mobs to aggro to you. It is therefore best to [[crowd control]] them (e.g. [[Sap]]) or avoid them altogether.

;Getting too close to an Eye of Xirus:
:{{text|emote|Eye of Xirus looks in your direction!}}
:{{text|bossemote|Eye of Xirus spots you and runs to its allies for help!}}

;Getting too close to a Shadowgore Stalker:
:{{text|emote|Shadowgore Stalker sniffs the air excitedly.}}
:{{text|emote|Shadowgore Stalker perks up!}}
:{{text|emote|Shadowgore Stalker growls.}}

As you make your way towards Akaari, she speaks to her servants.
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|Prepare yourselves, minions. Our lord requires us on the field of battle.}}
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|Our enemies will feel the fangs' agonizing bite! They will all perish!}}

Once you reach Akaari, engage her in combat. On aggro, she says:
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|You were dead the moment you arrived here.}}

During the fight, she uses an ability that creates several illusionary copies of herself that aid her in combat.
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|Try to keep up.}}

Once you get Akaari to around 75% health, she will stun you with [[Cheap Shot]].
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|Enough!}}
:''A [[Soulkeeper (mob)|Soulkeeper]] [[Jailer (demon)|jailer]] emerges from a portal and begins using a draining spell on the player as the screen slowly fades to black.''
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|Take them to the holding cell. Lord [[Kil'jaeden]] will be most pleased.}}

===Stage 2: The Key===
:''The Soulkeeper is in a deep trance. Obtain the key he has dangling from his belt.''
*Use [[Pick Pocket]] on the Soulkeeper.

When you awaken, you have been disarmed by the and placed in a cage by the "Chains of the Legion" spell. The Soulkeeper is floating right next to the cage and undergoing a "Focused Trance", the ability description of which reads: "This unit is unaware of his surroundings."

:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|Move out, armies of Kil'jaeden! Glory awaits!}}
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|That jailer presents an opportunity for your escape.}}

Enter [[Stealth]] and use [[Pick Pocket]] on the Soulkeeper to obtain the [[Holding Cell Key]].

===Stage 3: Escape Artist===
:''Now that you have the key, free yourself from the cage and reclaim your weapons.''
*Escape the Jailer's Prison.
*Reclaim your weapons.
*Open the Holding Cell door.

Interact with the cage to destroy it and free yourself. Interact with the [[Weapons Cache]] in the northeastern part of the chamber to remove the "Chains of the Legion" debuff and re-equip your weapons. Then, simply head over to the [[Legion Door]] and interact with it to break it open.

===Stage 4: The Eyes of the Deceiver===
:''Akaari has sent [[Inquisitor]] [[Xirus]] to stop you.''
*Slay Inquisitor Xirus.

As you break open the door, the Shadowgore Darkcaster and Bloodmaiden standing the next room flee in panic just before Xirus himself appears in the center of the chamber.
:{{text|yell|Shadowgore Darkcaster|Xirus is here. Run!}}
:{{text|yell|Shadowgore Bloodmaiden|Get out while you still can!}}
:{{text|say|Xirus|I herald your endless torment.}}
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|Xirus, deal with them. We have nearly made contact.}}

During fight:
:{{text|say|Xirus|The end is inevitable.}}
:{{text|say|Xirus|Welcome the embrace of the twisting dark.}}

Upon killing Xirus, he says:
:{{text|say|They will devour your flesh until nothing remains...}}

===Stage 5: Ascension===
:''Find Akaari Shadowgore atop the citadel.''
*Ascend the Citadel
*Find Akaari Shadowgore.

:{{text|say|Val'zuun|The fangs are within your grasp!}}
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|Kill them, you fools! I will not be denied my destiny!}}

[[Shadowgore Stalker]]s, a [[Chaos Guard]] and several [[Shadowgore Bloodmaiden]]s patrol both of the ramps leading up to the top of the citadel. It is easiest to sneak past all of them using Stealth.

Once you reach the top of the citadel, a cutscene begins.
:''Akaari is standing in front of an immense pool of fel lava.''
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|Welcome, Lord of Flame! Welcome, Kil'jaeden!}}
:''Kil'jaeden the Deceiver rises from the pool.''
:{{text|say|Kil'jaeden|You have done well, Akaari. You have earned my blessing.}}
:''Kil'jaeden begins channeling dark magic into Akaari, who is lifted off of the floor.''
:{{text|say|Kil'jaeden|Azhir manari kirel. Akim manari galar!}}
:''Akaari lands back on the floor.''
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|The fangs... their power is beyond comprehension! I am your humble servant, my lord!}}
:{{text|say|Kil'jaeden|It is time for your true test. Use the Fangs to dismantle [[Azeroth]]'s kingdoms from within. Let their shattered husks pave our path to victory!}}
:''Akaari walks over to stand in a ritual circle in the center of her platform.''
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|They will taste blood in your name!}}
:''Kil'jaeden sinks back into the fel pool and disappears.''

===Stage 6: A Duel of Fate===
:''Kill Akaari Shadowgore.''
*Kill Akaari Shadowgore.

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|Let us finish this once and for all.}}

During fight:
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|Do you feel the fangs' bite withering the flesh from your very bones?}}
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|[[Mephistroth]] guide my hand! I will not fail!}}
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|I have broken entire worlds from the inside out. Azeroth will crumble!}}
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|No more games.}}

Death:
:{{text|say|Akaari Shadowgore|Join me... in the Nether...}}

===Final Stage: Master of Shadows===
:''Wield the Fangs of the Devourer.''
*Wield the Fangs of the Devourer.

The Fangs appear above the ritual circle, floating in mid-air. After interacting with and looting them, Val'zuun's voice is heard once again as the Shadowgore Citadel begins to crumble.
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|The citadel has begun a self-destruct sequence. Make your way to the portal once you have the fangs!}}

Head straight west to the western platform of the citadel and used the Twisted Gateway to return to the Underbelly Descent and exit the scenario.

When you arrive back on Azeroth, Val'zuun applauds your efforts.
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|Ah, you made it. Well done!}}
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|[[Valeera Sanguinar|Valeera]] said you would know where to meet her upon your return. Not wise to keep her waiting.}}
:''Val'zuun bows.''
:{{text|say|Val'zuun|Until our paths cross again.}}
:''Val'zuun walks away deeper into the Underbelly and despawns.''

Return to the [[Chamber of Shadows]] in the order hall to turn in the quest.
