*[[Valeera Sanguinar|Valeera]]'s plan considered
*[[Tess Greymane|Tess]]' plan considered

==Description==
For quite some time, we've been looking for someone who can operate outside these halls.

<Name>, you are the answer to that search. You will be the blade in the dark that vanquishes our foes.

In order to do so, you require weapons capable of striking down the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s best.

Greymane, Tethys, and Valeera each have devised plans to obtain weapons worthy of the tasks to come. I suggest you hear each out before proceeding.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}} (level 100)
*1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well chosen.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lord Jorach Ravenholdt|Consider your choice carefully.}}
:{{text|say|Fleet Admiral Tethys|Gimme yer ear, <name>. I got a plan that's guaranteed to put worthy blades in them hands!}}
:{{text|say|Valeera Sanguinar|I'm close to locating a foe we've been hunting for years. With a bit of help, we can take her out and lay claim to her daggers.}}
:{{text|say|Princess Tess Greymane|[[The Kingslayers]] are the only way to ensure the Legion's end. Hear me out!}}

Tethys:
:What can I do for ya?
:{{gossip|Tell me about your plan.}}
::Just after the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]], one o' me best discovered a pair o' golden cutlasses unlike any ye've e'er seen. The moment [[Dread Admiral Eliza|Eliza]] touched 'em, she had a vision o' herself conquerin' city after city, commandin' a crew o' lost souls.

::Ye may doubt such a grand tale, but it indeed came t' pass. [[The Dreadblades]] 'ave claimed countless souls, and now we're comin' for 'em!

Valeera:
:Jorach spoke highly of you. He's a good friend to have.
:{{gossip|Tell me about your plan.}}
::After the fall of [[Sargeras]]' hound [[Goremaw the Devourer|Goremaw]], his [[nathrezim|dreadlords]] took the beast's fangs and forged them into a pair of daggers known as the [[Fangs of the Devourer]]. It's said they still carry the monster's bite.

::Sargeras called upon one of his top assassins to wield the fangs, an [[eredar]] named [[Akaari Shadowgore]]. Despite our best attempts, we haven't been able to stop her.

Tess:
:What's the matter? Never seen a princess who knows how to twist a blade?
:{{gossip|Tell me about your plan.}}
::I plan to acquire the cursed dagggers that took down [[Llane Wrynn I|King Llane Wrynn]]. [[Garona Halforcen|Garona]] hid the Kingslayers for good reason. Their power is not to be underestimated.

::I need your help to retrieve them. These storied blades are just what we need to destroy {{Au|Gul'dan}} and his foul allies.

After talking to all three Shadows, speak to Jorach again.
:The Uncrowned will do what no others can: finish this war.
:{{gossip|I'm ready to make a decision.}}

;Which weapon should we pursue first?
;Assassination
:The Kingslayers were Garona's daggers as [[Gul'dan]]'s personal assassin. They inflict a traceless poison, leaving little evidence of their grim work.

:Garona stowed the blades away long ago in her anguish, but she has taken them up once more against a dangerous Legion cult.

:We have to find her.

:[[The Kingslayers]]

:(Select)

;Outlaw
:The Dread Admiral Eliza is known as the scourge of the [[South Seas]]. Many have learned to fear her cursed blades.

:We've tracked her anchored off the coast of [[Azsuna]] in the [[Broken Isles]]. Her blades can be yours if you hurry.

:[[The Dreadblades]]

:(Select)

;Subtlety
:The Legion now boast one Akaari Shadowgore - an eredar assassin unlike any we've seen. Her daggers twist the very air around their wielder to conceal them in shadow.

:We have intelligence pointing to her current location. Now is the time to strike.

:[[Fangs of the Devourer]]

:(Select)

;Artifact chosen
:Are you sure you wish to pursue this artifact? It may be some time before you are able to seek out the others. (Okay/Cancel)
