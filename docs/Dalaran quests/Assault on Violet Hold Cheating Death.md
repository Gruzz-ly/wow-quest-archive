==Objectives==
Craft 2 Failure Detection Pylons. Go to the [[Assault on Violet Hold|Violet Hold]] and recover a Plasmatic Laser Bolt and return everything to [[Didi the Wrench]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Failure Detection Pylon]] (2)
* [[Plasmatic Laser Bolt]]
* Third Escaped Prisoner Defeated

==Description==
[[Hobart Grapplehammer|Hobart]] was showing me a copy of a design you found, and it got me to thinking of a new module for [[Reaves]].

Unfortunately I didn't have the materials required to test it.

Could you make me a couple Failure Detection Pylons?

I'll also need a plasmatic laser bolt. You should be able to find one in the [[Violet Hold]].

==Rewards==
You will learn the following: [[Schematic: Reaves Module: Failure Detection Mode]]

==Progress==
Just rip the bolt off of one of the prison cells. I'm sure whatever's inside has long since died.

==Completion==
<Didi takes the pylons and begins tinkering with them and starts writing some notes.>

Yea, that should do the trick!

One new and improved Reaves module schematic for you, <name>.
