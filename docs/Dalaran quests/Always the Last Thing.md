==Objectives==
Find a suitable power source for [[Didi the Wrench|Didi]]'s design and deliver it to her. Then, see if her new battery actually works.
* [[Prismatic Felslate Diamond]]
* Have Didi test the diamond
* [[Volatile Leytorrent Potion]]
* Have Didi test the potion
* Find a [[Fel-Infused Core|Fel-infused Core]]
*Get [[Catriona's Jewel]]
*Trade Jewel for Core
* Have Didi test the core

==Description==
Well, I've worked out all the kinks. Added a few nuts and bolts, and fitted a new housing for the power core.

Problem is, none of the batteries I have here seem to work. I think we're gonna have to fashion somethin' new together.

I'm gonna need your help, <name>. Let's start by trying a charged gem from the jewelcrafting shop down the way.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*Schematic: Reaves Battery

You will also receive:
*[[Reaves Battery]]

==Progress==
Hopefully it's not too much trouble finding a suitable power source.

==Completion==
We did it! That's one fully functional, killer-lookin' [[fel reaver]].

Should it ever run out of power, here's the schematic for that battery I came up with.

Just pop a new one in it and you should be good to go.

By the way, whatcha think we should name it? I was thinking somethin' deadly, like "Reaves."

==Notes==
;Speaking with [[Tiffany Cartier]]

:{{Gossip|Didi sent me to retrieve a Prismatic Felslate Diamond.}}
:{{Text|say|Tiffany Cartier|I suppose I can part with one. But tell Didi I'm sending her a bill for it. We're not running a charity here.}}

;Returning to Didi
:{{Gossip|Here's the diamond you requested.}}
:{{Text|say|Didi the Wrench|Let me just insert this into the core and we'll see what happens.}}
:{{Text|say|Didi the Wrench|Flashy, but ineffective. We'll have to try something else. Maybe we need a chemical reaction.}}
:{{Text|say|Didi the Wrench|Go to the alchemy shop and ask Deucus for a potion with some punch in it.}}

;Speaking with [[Deucus Valdera]]
:{{Gossip|Didi sent me to retrieve a Volatile Leytorrent Potion.}}
:{{Text|say|Deucus Valdera|Ah yes, I have one right here. Now be VERY careful with that. Spilling a drop of it can result in, well, unfortunate results.}}

;Returning to Didi
:{{Gossip|Here's the potion you requested.}}

:{{Text|say|Didi the Wrench|Alright, I'm going to pour in the solution now. Watch yourself, not sure how this is going to react.}}
:{{Text|say|Didi the Wrench|Are you alright? *Cough, cough* I'm thinking the only thing that's going to work here is a fel-infused core.}}
:''A small explosion happens, and Didi is disoriented for a second.''
:{{Text|say|Didi the Wrench|It's a long shot, but there may be someone here in Dalaran who has one. Try asking Bonegrim in the [[Ledgerdemain Lounge]] if he's come across any.}}

;Speaking with [[Bonegrim]]
:{{Gossip|Would you happen to have a Fel-infused Core?}}

:{{Text|say|Bonegrim|Yea, I got what you're looking for. But I ain't just gonna hand it over. I need something in return.}}
*{{Text|say|Bonegrim|There's this lovely, [[Catriona's Jewel|red jewel]] upstairs that caught my eye. Get it for me and I'll trade you the [[Fel-Infused Core|core]] for it.}}

Head upstairs.

;Speaking with [[Catriona Macrae]]
:{{Gossip|Catriona, I heard someone was looking for you downstairs.}}
:{{Text|say|Catriona Macrae|Oh, well then I'll be right down. Coming!}}
:''Catriona goes downstairs.''
:{{Text|say|Catriona Macrae|Hello, was someone looking for me?}}
:{{Text|say|Catriona Macrae|I wonder where they went to. Oh well, perhaps they'll come back.}}

Click on [[Catriona's Jewel]]
:A large, radiant ruby set upon a pillow.

:{{Gossip|Try to take the jewel.}}

If Catriona is not sent away, she instead says:
:{{Text|say|Catriona Macrae|Excuse me, but that's my jewel. Could you please leave it alone?}}

Return to Bonegrim.

:{{Gossip|Here's the jewel, now give me the core.}}
:{{Text|say|Bonegrim|Nice doing business with you, friend.}}

;Returning to Didi
:{{Gossip|Here's the core you requested.}}

:{{Text|say|Didi the Wrench|You found something?! That's amazing! You're amazing, <name>! Keep your fingers crossed, I'm gonna put it in now.}}
:''Reaves comes to life, and Didi cheers.''
:{{Text|say|Didi the Wrench|Success!}}
