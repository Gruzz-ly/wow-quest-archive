== Objectives ==
Kill [[Lord Marrowgar]].

This quest can be completed with any difficulty or size raid.
* [[Lord Marrowgar]] slain

== Description ==
Lord Marrowgar is the guardian of the [[Frozen Throne]] within the [[Spire Chamber]]. Pieced together by the [[Lich King]] from the bones of a thousand vanquished adventurers, Marrowgar wields the power of the throne itself.

Without the destruction of this bone wraith, there is no hope of taking [[Icecrown Citadel]].

The [[Council of Six]] has decreed that Lord Marrowgar must die! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|29|60|cp=138}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor]]

== Progress ==
I have heard no news of Lord Marrowgar's demise.  Is there a problem, <class>?

== Completion ==
The Frozen Throne is without its chief guardian thanks to you. Our attacks upon the Lich King's forces will be all the more successful now.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 3.3.0|note=Added.}}
