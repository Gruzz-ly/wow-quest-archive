==Objectives==
Meet with [[Lessah Moonwater|Lessah]] in [[Highmountain]].

==Description==
[[Things of the Past|This new shop]] is shaping up quite nicely, I think. Still, there's so much left to organize.

<Name>, Lessah has requested your presence in Highmountain. Something about a moose?

I'm not sure to what she's speaking of, but as soon as you have a chance, please go see her. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>, I've found an actual piece of something very close to [[Huln Highmountain|Huln]].

I believe that this the very bone of [[Eche'ro]], Huln Highmountain's animal companion!

==Progression==
#[[The Right Path]]
#[[Laying to Rest]]
