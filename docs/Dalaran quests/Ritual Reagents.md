==Objectives==
Search within [[Dalaran]] for Grave Dust, a Can of Overheated Oil, an Aged Snowplum Brandy and a Stag Blood Sample.
* [[Grave Dust]]
* [[Can of Overheated Oil]]
* [[Aged Snowplum Brandy]]
* [[Stag Blood Sample]]

==Description==
The [[:Skull of the Man'ari]], oh good choice! It's very powerful and it's held by an [[Mephistroth|even more powerful Dreadlord]]!

There is a weakness, the skull has a will of its own! If we can commune with the skull we might be able to convince it to serve you instead!

We will need reagents from the floating city before we can perform the ritual to commune with it. Dust from a fresh grave, dark oil, and a powerful alcohol catalyst.

Oh, and blood! I sense a beast whose blood should be perfect.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Progress==
Did you obtain everything, friend?

==Completion==
Very good! Now, we're ready to begin.

==Notes==
On accept, Calydus runs up out of the [[Circle of Wills]] into the [[Underbelly]] before despawning.
:{{text|say|Calydus|While you are busy, Calydus will search for a suitable location for the ritual.}}

The [[Stag Blood Sample]] is obtained from a [[Docile Stag]] in the [[Magical Menagerie]]. {{coords|59.6|38.8|Dalaran}} Upon interacting with the stag, you will be given two different options to obtain the blood sample.
:<The beast looks at you for a moment and neighs.>
:{{gossip|<Carefully take a small blood sample.>}}
:{{gossip|<Obtain the blood with your dark magic.>}}

Using the first option will cause the stag to briefly rear and neigh in pain in addition to granting you the blood sample. Using the second option, however, will cause you to channel a demonic draining spell on the beast until it dies, granting you the blood sample as well as eliciting the following reaction from [[Breanni]].
:{{text|emote|Breanni gasps.}}
:{{text|say|Breanni|You need to leave, warlock... NOW!}}

The [[Aged Snowplum Brandy]] is found on the counter on the bottom floor of the [[Legerdemain Lounge]]. {{coords|48.6|38.6|Dalaran}} Upon looting it, a [[Drunken Mage]] appears behind you and attacks you.
:{{text|bossemote|You hear footsteps behind you!}}
:{{text|yell|Drunken Mage|Hey! Tha... thash MY drink! <hic!>}}

Upon damaging the mage down to 1% health, he gains the "Knock Out" buff and falls asleep on the floor.
:{{text|say|Drunken Mage|S... sleepy time... <hic!>}}

For the [[Can of Overheated Oil]], head to [[Like Clockwork]] in the [[Magus Commerce Exchange]] and loot one of the objects of the same name. {{coords|38|25|Dalaran}}

Finally, the [[Grave Dust]] is obtained from either of the two [[Freshly Dug Grave]]s found at the small graveyard northeast of the [[Violet Citadel]]. {{coords|34.5|38.7|Dalaran}}

Upon obtaining all four reagents:
:{{text|say|Calydus|Calydus found a perfect spot for the ritual! Come, friend, meet Calydus in the room behind the curtains  at the place called the [[Violet Gate]].}}
Head to the Violet Gate and speak with Calydus to proceed to the next quest.
