==Objectives==
Unlock artifacts traits using Infinite Power gained from looting Epoch Mementos from any enemy.
*[[Infinite Power]] gathered (250)
*Artifact weapon trait purchased

==Description==
There's more to artifacts than meets the eye, <name>.

Simply using an artifact allows its legend to grow, and as that legend grows, so too does its power.

In order to unlock the full potential of that power, however, you'll need to focus infinite power into the artifact's traits. As more traits are empowered the artifact's true potential will be unlocked, and its legend will be undeniable.

Let's get started.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||20}}
*2,150 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Progress==
Unlocking the full potential of your artifact will be key to understanding their impact on this timeline.

==Completion==
As you gather infinite power do not forget to focus it into your artifact.

The more power you invest, the swifter you will gather more infinite power and grow your artifact's legend--and your own.

==Notes==
As players likely only have ~60 Infinite Power at this point, work on the other quest, [[Get Plenty of Exorcise]], to earn 500. Then open the artifact interface again and spend 125 Infinite Power on Powerful Arcanocrystal Shard, Fortified Arcanocrystal Shard, and Masterful Arcanocrystal Shard.

Upon accepting [[As A Matter of Artifact]], [[Get Plenty of Exorcise]] and [[Scavenger Hunting]]:
