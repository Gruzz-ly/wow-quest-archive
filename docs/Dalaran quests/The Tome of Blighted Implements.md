==Objectives==

* Artifact Chosen

==Description==
The book you carry is the key to your friends' salvation, and to your absolute power! It holds within information about many relics too dangerous to the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] to leave unchecked.

Read, friend. And decide which of these artifacts you will use to strike [[Jagganoth]] down!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|70}}
* 7,550 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you made your choice?

==Completion==
Yes, friend chose very wisely!

==Notes==
Players should pick the artifact for the spec they wish to play for some period of time, as the other two artifacts cannot be acquired until level 102.

;Which weapon should we pursue first?
;Affliction
:Wielded by [[Sataiel]], the first [[necrolyte]], the Deadwind Harvester earned its name by stripping the life from the lands known as [[Deadwind Pass]].

:After centuries locked away, Ulthalesh has been discovered in the possession of the [[Dark Riders]]. You must hunt them down if you wish to find where they have it hidden.

:[[Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester]]

;Demonology
:The sorcerer [[Thal'kiel]] was one of the first [[eredar]] who learned the techniques of summoning and controlling demons.
:After his defeat, his skull was put on display as an example of the dangers of the dark arts.
:The lesson went unheeded.

:After the eredar's fall, the skull was taken by the generals of the Burning Legion to enhance their control of their armies.

:[[Skull of the Man'ari]]

:(Select)

;Destruction
:Crafted by hundreds of eredar warlocks and the [[Sargeras|Dark Titan]] himself, it was used for terrible acts of destruction. Capable of tearing gaps in reality to other worlds, it was the key to the invasion of [[Azeroth]].

:Later used by [[Ner'zhul]], he thoughtlessly unleashed its power on [[Draenor]], causing its [[Outland|near destruction]]. Thought to be long lost, it has returned to the hands of the Legion.

:[[Scepter of Sargeras]]

:(Select)

;Artifact chosen
:Are you sure you wish to pursue this artifact? It may be some time before you are able to seek out the others. (Okay/Cancel)

;Speaking with Calydus
