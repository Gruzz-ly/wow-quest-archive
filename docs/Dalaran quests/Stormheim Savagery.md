==Objectives==
Obtain 7 Vrykul Leather Bindings.
* [[Vrykul Leather Binding]] (7)

==Description==
There's a land below - [[Stormheim]], they call it - that's inhabited by [[vrykul]]. I remember the vrykul from my days in [[Northrend]].

What I remember most was how well-crafted their armor was.

If the vrykul here are as skilled as the ones in Northrend, then I'm certain we can learn something by studying their armaments.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Recipe List: Warhide Armor]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are the vrykul giving you much trouble?

==Completion==
Well now, this is a good variety of equipment you've brought me. Let's see what we have here...

<Diane studies the armor pieces very carefully for a while.>

Look here, <name>. See how they've strengthened the leather by over-stitching the seams...
