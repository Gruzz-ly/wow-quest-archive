==Objectives==
Talk to [[Eternus]] at the [[Infinite Bazaar]] in [[Dalaran]] once you have shaped a new legend.
*Amass Infinite Power
*Infinite Research assignments completed (20)

==Description==
It is clear now that the person is at least as important as the artifact they wield.

Perhaps it is the quality of mortality that diminishes the importance of the individual through the lens of history. While an artifact is eternal, the people wielding them are fleeting.

But no flame that burns brightly burns forever.

I want you to burn as brightly as you can. Empower your artifact and carve a new legend into the world for all to see.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|23|40}}
*[[Ensemble: Sargerei Commander's Felscorned Regalia]]
*[[To Fel and Back (Legion Remix)]]

==Progress==
An artifact cannot empower itself. Its power grows only when its wielder performs great deeds with it.

==Completion==
Humbling.

It is the very nature of finite existence that is the answer.

Mortality is the flame that shines brightest because it is free to choose a single moment of glory, rather than be burdened by the weight of eternity.

Choose your moment well, <name>, and nothing, not even time, will be able to stop you.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Eternus]].
{{Dialogue|
Time is as varied as it is infinite.

{{gossip|quest=|Let us speak about my progress.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
It is said that knowledge is power.

Surely, then, power must also be knowledge.

Tell me, <name>. With all the knowledge you have gained, what do you now know to be true?

{{plainlist|
*{{gossip|quest=|The power of the artifacts is too great. No matter how well-intentioned the wielder, they will eventually be corrupted by them.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|The artifacts are mighty tools, but ultimately, it is in champions forged by those tools that Azeroth will be saved.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|It is not about the power of the artifacts, but the lessons such power has taught the wielder. That is their true power.}}}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I... I see. Thank you, <name>, for imparting this wisdom with me.

I must take some time to consider this.

Go, learn what else you can while this timeline remains stable.

{{gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
