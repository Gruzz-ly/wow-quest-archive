==Objectives==
Travel to [[Darkstone Isle]] near the [[Broken Shore]] and search for [[Alora]].
*Flight to Darkstone Isle secured
*Demon Camp cleared
*Alora resurrected

==Description==
Alora and I were were{{sic}} able to escape through one of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s portals back to [[Azeroth]] but that's about as far as our luck got us.

The portal put us on a small isle somewhere to the west of the Broken Shore. They saw us quickly and we made a run for the protection of the water. As I attempted to leap to safety, I was wounded. But Alora... she tripped and I watched them drag her back.

Rescue her, please! I'll mark where the camp is on your map, just don't let her go through that ordeal again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
*15,050 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Completion==
I felt my soul being ripped from my body. If you hadn't come when you did... I don't even want to think about it!

Is there anything I can do to repay you? I owe you my life after all.

<You mention to her Barrem's story.>

Barrem still lives too? Oh thank the [[Light]]! Yes, I'll gladly tell you everything I know.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Vindicator Boros]]|I'm coming with you, <name>. You helped one of my men, so it's only fitting that I return the favor.}}
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|I'll meet you at [[Krasus' Landing]]. We can take my [[gryphon]] down to the island.}}

At Krasus' Landing, Boros is standing next to two gryphons: [[Lightfeather]] and [[Morning Glory]].
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|Let's fly, <name>. Lightfeather is saddled and ready to go.}}
Interact with Lightfeather to mount it and fly down to Darkstone Isle. Boros follows closely behind on Morning Glory, landing on the island a few moments after you do.

A few yards away, a [[Niskaran Executioner]] is sucking the soul out of Alora, who is lying dead next to a few Legion cages.
:{{text|say|Vindicator Boros|That beast is trying to take her soul! Hurry, we can still save her!}}

Upon aggroing the executioner:
:{{text|say|Niskaran Executioner|So eager to be enslaved.}}

After killing the executioner, Boros kneels down next to Alora's body. Use [[Resurrection]] to bring her back to life.
:{{text|say|Alora|I... I'm alive! By the Light, I live again!}}
