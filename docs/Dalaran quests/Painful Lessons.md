==Objectives==
Take the portal to Dalaran.
*Take [[Jaina]]'s portal to [[Dalaran]] (Optional)
*Meet with [[Khadgar]] in Dalaran

==Description==
Magni appears stable for now, but he's still not responsive. We need to get him treatment quickly. I'll open a portal to Dalaran.

Follow us when you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm unsure why the Speaker of Azeroth would end up in such a state after attempting to... well, speak with Azeroth.

All we can do is wait for Magni to recover.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|[[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]]|Hopefully we can revive him. Meet us in Dalaran when you're able.}}

Before Jaina teleports everyone away, she has gossip:
{{dialogue|Magni will recover. He must. And not just because he is a dear friend.

We need to learn what Azeroth told him. Before it's too late.}}

Take the Portal to Dalaran that she opened to enter the Dalaran location above the Broken Isles. It drops players off in the [[Portrait Room]]:
:{{Text|say|[[Thrall]]|He tried to commune directly with [[Azeroth (titan)|Azeroth]]. It seems the strain was... too much.}}
:{{text|say|Moira Thaurissan|Da... What have you done to yourself this time?}}

Characters have new gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Thrall|I don't believe we should blame Azeroth for this outcome. Magni knew the risks of connecting with her with such reluctance in his heart.

Now we can only hope that he was able to hear her message in the end.}}
{{dialogue|title=Anduin Wrynn|Magni is stable for now, but I don't know how long it will take for him to recover. 

At least he's with family.}}
{{dialogue|title=Moira Thaurissan|Father... Da... What have you gotten yourself into this time? You can't leave us like this.

Please be alright, you old coot.

{{gossip|Tell me more about yourself.}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Moira Thurissan, Queen-Regent of the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Irons]]. I represent [[Dark Iron clan|my clan]] in the [[Council of Three Hammers]]. I also happen tae be Magni's daughter.

Some will say I betrayed [[Ironforge]] by marrying [[Dagran Thaurissan|the emperor]] of their greatest enemies. However, the current circumstance speaks for itself. The [[dwarf]] [[clan]]s now live in peace as equals, and I can assure you that it was my efforts that made that possible.}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Khadgar|Troubling times lie ahead. But don't they always?

At least we can face them together.

{{Gossip|{{text|rare|(Play Movie)}} Remind me of the events so far.}}
