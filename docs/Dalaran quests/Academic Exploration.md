==Objectives==
Meet with [[Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher|Tae'thelan]] in [[Azsuna]].

==Description==
<Name>, good to see you. What do you think of my shop so far? Not too bad for just one person, huh?

By the way, High Examiner Tae'thalan{{sic}} has been digging around Azsuna, and asked that I send you to see him.

Knowing him, he probably thinks he's found yet another world-shatteringly powerful artifact.

==Rewards==

==Completion==
Hello, <name>. I'm glad you came.

I've found something that may serve both of our interests.
