==Objectives==
Acquire Precipitating Powder in [[Neltharion's Lair]] and bring it to [[Deucus Valdera]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Precipitating Powder]]
* [[Dargrul (tactics)|Dargrul]] slain

==Description==
I've heard rumors that the ancient [[drogbar]] collected powder from the residue of [[dragon]]'s breath. If it's true that Neltharion's Lair lies somewhere below us, it seems a likely source.

Go there and try to find a replacement for my powder.

You will receive:
* 15,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have we here?

==Completion==
You... you found some? I'm impressed, and that doesn't happen easily I'll have you know.

Now let's see what exactly it was that you found...
