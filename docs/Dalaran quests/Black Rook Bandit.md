==Objectives==
Obtain 5 pieces of Black Rook Armor.
* [[Black Rook Armor]] (5)

==Description==
I've heard rumors of a [[Black Rook Hold|grand castle]] in [[Val'sharah]] that's known to house an impressive army. Surely, the armor they wear ain't made of sticks and hay.

I'm willing to bet they've fashioned some mail armor at some point fer their troops and it's just sitting there, ripe for the taking.

How about ye head over there and see what ye can "borrow" from their armory.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Recipe: Battlebound Armor]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40|}}
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Make sure ye don't get captured now, lad.

==Completion==
I knew ye had it in ye! Good work, lad.

<Thanid looks the pieces over with a careful eye.>

Very clever. The [[Night elf|elves]] certainly know their trade.

We should be able to copy this method with little to no problem.
