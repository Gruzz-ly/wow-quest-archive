==Objectives==
Purchase a Depleted Leyflame Burner from [[Hobart Grapplehammer]] and bring it to [[Deucus Valdera]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Depleted Leyflame Burner]]

==Description==
I've heard that someone over in the [[Like Clockwork|engineering shop]] is selling a burner that might be usable. You could likely negotiate a fairer price than I could!

The shop is just across the street. I'll make a note on your map for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,070 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's a good thing the other crafters around here make such items. I couldn't imagine wasting my time on such endeavors.

==Completion==
Ah, this burner is exactly what we need for the alchemy table!

Wait just a moment... No, no, this will never do!
