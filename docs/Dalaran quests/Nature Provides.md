==Objectives==
Obtain 10 Foxflower.

If you are not an herbalist, you can purchase Foxflower on the Auction House, or you can obtain it from another player.
* [[Foxflower]] (10)

==Description==
This is interesting, it says that leystone reacts violently with anything it views as a contaminant. Our foreign-mined flux was enough to cause the small explosion.

Local ingredients, however, have learned to coexist with leystone. Up in [[Highmountain]], an herb called [[:foxflower]] grows that can be turned into a suitable flux.

Go and gather some foxflower that we can turn into a usable flux.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|82|}}
* 15,340 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How goes the search for foxflower?

==Completion==
Excellent work. Let's get these turned into flux right away.
