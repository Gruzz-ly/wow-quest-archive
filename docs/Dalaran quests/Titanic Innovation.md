==Completion==
Spectacular! Marvelous! At last, I understand fully, and the [[titan]]s themselves speak to me! They have shown me how to use the essences to craft the finest armors the [[Azeroth|world]] has ever seen, though I think the results may be... somewhat unpredictable.

<Vridiel beams with pride.>

Well, what are you waiting for? Bring me as many Wakening Essence as you can find!
