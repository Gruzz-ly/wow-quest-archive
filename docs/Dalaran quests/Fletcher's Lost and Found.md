==Rewards==
You will learn how to create: [[Kungaloosh]]

==Completion==
Above the stale, unwashed stench, you catch a whiff of a familiar smell! It appears as if this once-mighty adventurer has a real love for Kungaloosh.

Peeking through the bars, you can barely make out the recipe written on his arm...

==Notes==
This may be a tribute to Fletcher Hodges, one of the main characters of the [[Wikipedia:Adventurers Club|Adventurers Club]] - the now-closed Walt Disney World nightclub. The [http://allears.net/din/rec_kung.htm Kungaloosh] was the signature drink of the Adventurer's Club.
