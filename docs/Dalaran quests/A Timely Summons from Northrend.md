'''A Timely Summons from Northrend''' is a [[timewalking]] quest from [[Archmage Timear]] in [[Dalaran]] above the [[Broken Isles]].

==Objectives==
Meet with [[Vormu]] in [[Dalaran]] above [[Crystalsong Forest]].

* Speak with Vormu in Dalaran

==Description==
The blazing wanes in the shadow of a celestial mass, striking fear in to the seers. Seek out the sage Vormu in Dalaran, and lend her your aid.

No, not this Dalaran, the other one. Yes I know, it's terribly confusing.

==Completion==
We're behind schedule - let's get moving.

==Notes==
If you're picking this quest up from the Dalaran in the Broken Isles, the quickest means to get to the "other Dalaran" is to use the [[Vale of Eternal Blossoms]] portal in {{alliance}} [[Greyfang Enclave]] / {{horde}} [[Windrunner's Sanctuary]]. From there, you can use the faction shrine's portal on the upper level to the Dalaran in Northrend.
