==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Emerald Nightmare]] and acquire Nythendra's Heart. Bring it to [[Alard Schmied|Alard]] in [[Dalaran]].
* [[Nythendra's Heart]]

==Description==
Now that we have all the ingredients assembled, we need one last thing.

The fire of my forges burn hot, but not hot enough to work these ingredients into glass. For that, we need more heat. The heat of a [[dragon]], to be exact.

I'm aware of one that has emerged from the [[Emerald Dream]] in a corrupted state. Corrupted or not, a dragon's heart burns with enough heat to melt the strongest of materials.

Bring me its heart and you'll have [[High-Capacity Decoction Conduit|your conduit]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm getting the mixture ready now. As soon as you return with the heart, I'll begin the construction.

==Completion==
<You hand the heart over to Alard. He places it within his forge and it begins to burn white hot.>

Perhaps I should refer to you as Dragonslayer <name> from now on.

Joking aside, I'll begin my forging.

==Notes==
;On completion
:{{Text|say|Alard Schmied|Alright <name>, you may want to stand back. Things are going to get hot.}}
:''Alard proceeds to his [[Alard's Forge|forge]] to work on the [[High-Capacity Decoction Conduit]].''
:{{Text|say|Alard Schmied|Adding the sulfate now.}}
:{{Text|say|Alard Schmied|And last but not least, the dust.}}
:{{Text|say|Alard Schmied|Success! I have to say, this is some of my finest work. I guess some credit goes to [[Deucus Valdera|Deucus]] and his detailed design.}}
:''Alard returns to his usual spot.''
