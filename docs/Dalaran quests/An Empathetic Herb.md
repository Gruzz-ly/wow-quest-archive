==Objectives==
Obtain 15 Healthy Dreamleaf and 5 Blight-Infested Dreamleaf.
* [[Healthy Dreamleaf]] (15)
* [[Blight-Infested Dreamleaf]] (5)

==Description==
Something is different about this [[:dreamleaf]], though. It is less than pure.

I have a theory.

The wilds of [[Val'sharah]] have been blighted by a [[Emerald Nightmare|nightmarish curse]]. Sensitive herbs like this may be susceptible to such a blight.

I need more information before I can draw any conclusions. Find me some healthy samples and some blight-infested samples, and we can continue.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Herbalism techniques#Legion|Herbalism Technique: Dreamleaf (Rank 1)]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Those poor plants...

==Completion==
It is just as I suspected. The infested herb is dying... but this may be turned to our advantage.

Look, herbalist. The dying dreamleaf has swollen with herbaceous extract. While harvesting the healthy dreamleaf is trivial, you can harvest enormous amounts of product from the infested ones.
