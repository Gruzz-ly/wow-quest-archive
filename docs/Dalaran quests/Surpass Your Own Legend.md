==Objectives==
Talk to [[Eternus]] at the [[Infinite Bazaar]] in [[Dalaran]] once you have surpassed your own legend.
*Reach Level 80
*Infinite Research assignments completed (5)
*Speak with Eternus

==Description==
While artifacts are key, we must not dismiss the power of the individuals who wield them.

Continue in your fight against the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]. Grow strong, stronger than you ever thought possible.

Then we will compare the might of your legend against that of the artifact.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||20}}
*1,400 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Progress==
The person wielding an artifact is of some importance. But how much? Which legend is the greater?

Let us find out together.

==Completion==
I admit. I am pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong. Your power has grown and I cannot say with certainty which is the greater. You, or the weapon you wield.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Eternus]].
