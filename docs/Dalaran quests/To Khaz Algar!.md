==Objectives==
Tell Khadgar you're ready to depart.
* Talk to [[Khadgar]]

==Description==
From what [[Magni]] has seen, Khaz Algar may not be the safest of destinations. We'll be relying on your aid, should a fight break out.

Let me know when you're ready to depart.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
She was [[Archmage Drenden]]. All along, [[Xal'atath]] has been watching, plotting, right in front of me. How could I be so blind?

And now she's invading [[Dalaran]] with an army of [[nerubian]]s.

Xal'atath planned this. All of this. She wanted us to come to Khaz Algar.

==Notes==
Speak with Khadgar again:

An [[The War Within in-game cinematics|in-game cinematic]] plays, Dalaran Arrives at Khaz Algar:

{{#ev:youtube|1XmNNDU00Q0}}

''Exterior, day. Dalaran floating in the clouds off in the distance, shaded pink by the sun. Starting from the Violet Citadel, arcane crackles spread to cover the mainland and the outlying floating islands nearby. Once everything is covered, Dalaran disappears with a poof and a small shockwave.''

''Exterior, day. A wide, low-angle shot near sea level on the [[Isle of Dorn]] with the tower of [[Storm's Watch]] in the background. With a thump and another small shockwave, Dalaran ports in, still floating in the air.''

''Exterior, day. The northern edge of [[Antonidas Memorial]] in [[Dalaran]]. [[Moira Thaurissan]], [[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Magni Bronzebeard]], and [[Dagran Thaurissan II]] walk up to the edge of the city and look out upon their new environs.''

{{text|bossemote|Dagran Thaurissan II|It's even more amazing than I'd imagined!}}

{{text|bossemote|Magni Bronzebeard|But my visions were of fire and war.}}

''The camera focuses on Alleria just before she is wracked by ethereal screeching and a flash of [[Xal'atath]] staring at her.''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Something's wrong. I need to find Khadgar.}}

''Alleria backs away as the others turn to look at her, before she takes off at a sprint. Toward city center, she comes across [[Drenden|Archmage Drenden]].''

{{text|bossemote|Alleria Windrunner|Drenden. Where's the rest of the [[Council of Six|Council]]?}}

''Drenden chuckles, then starts floating off the ground. He gains a purple hue and starts speaking with Xal'atath's voice.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Drenden's been dead for years.}}

''As Drenden/Xal'atath passes behind Alleria, she shifts to reveal her true form and brings herself face to face with Alleria. Alleria unconsciously back-steps away.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|All this time, and you never once sensed my presence.}}

''Xal'atath teleports behind Alleria, taunting her from inches away. Without warning, Alleria pulls out her bow, drawing an arrow. As she's doing this, Xal'atath disappears, chuckling.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Oh. It's not time for that yet.}}

''Alleria glances around, looking for Xal'atath. The camera shifts to look down at Alleria from on high from a nearby tower.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|But if you're so eager for a fight, perhaps this can keep you occupied.}}

''As Xal'atath says "this", portals open up in the sky all over the city and [[nerubian flyer]]s start screaming out of them! The screams of civilians start increasing in the background. As the camera shifts around, bigger portals start spawning larger ground nerubian units.''

{{text|bossemote|Xal'atath|Until we meet again, Alleria.}}

After the cutscene, players are in a special version of Dalaran and are debuffed with Dangerous Skies:
:{{abilities|Dangerous Skies|The skies are too dangerous for flying.}}

Alleria is fending off attacking nerubians:

Speak with her.
