==Objectives==
Gather 1 Blood of Sargeras, 1 Felhide, 2 Felwort, and 100 Yseralline Seeds.
* [[Blood of Sargeras]]
* [[Felhide]]
* [[Felwort]] (2)
* [[Yseralline Seed]] (100)

==Description==
The first step in making this crucible useful is to restore the lining of its interior. That's going to require supplies you'll either gather yourself or obtain through trade with fellow [[adventurer]]s.

Felwort and yseralline seeds are familiar to herbalists.

Felhide is obtained through [[skinning]].

Blood of Sargeras can be found all over the [[Broken Isles]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|18|28|50}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Restoring the lining of the crucible is no simple task, <name>.

==Completion==
It looks like you acquired everything we need. Give me a few moments to apply them to the interior.

<Deucus works on the crucible, restoring its lining.>

Perfect! The crucible is almost ready for use.

Just one more tiny detail...
