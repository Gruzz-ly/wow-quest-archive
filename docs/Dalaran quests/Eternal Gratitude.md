==Objectives==
Step through the portal and meet [[Eternus]] and the [[infinite dragonflight]].
*[[Portal to the Infinite Bazaar|Portal]] used
*Speak to Eternus.

==Description==
Well, look at you. Saving [[Dalaran]]. You're starting to resemble your legend already.

<[[Moratari]] glances about to make sure you are indeed alone before continuing.>

We have somewhere to be and people to meet.

I'm opening a portal to the [[Infinite Bazaar]].

<Moratari considers the name for a moment.>

It's a place where we're safe to congregate out in the open without interfering with the timeline. Just step through when you're ready.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
: {{abilities|Clean Streets of Dalaran|Eternus accelerates the timeline to give Dalaran time to recover from the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s assault.|id=1248972|icon=spell_arcane_teleportdalaranbrokenisles}}

You will also receive:
*{{Cost||12|30}}
*210 [[XP]]
*[[Cache of Infinite Treasure]]

==Completion==
Moratari has kept me apprised of your endeavors in this timeline, <name>.

Know that I am pleased.

Dalaran will recover in time. Speaking of, I will accelerate the timeline until after the cleanup is complete.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Moratari|As exciting as all that was, I'll be glad to get back to the Infinite Bazaar. Eternus will surely want to speak with you, too.}}
:''She opens the Portal to the Infinite Bazaar.''

Take the portal to land at the floating island south of [[Dalaran]], the [[Infinite Bazaar]].

Catch up with [[Eternus]]:
:{{text|say|Eternus|It seems you've already had quite the impact on this timeline, <name>. But our work here has just begun.}}

Speak with her:
{{dialogue|Time is as varied as it is infinite.

{{gossip|<Stay awhile and listen.>}}}}
:''Moratari teleports in.''
:{{text|say|Moratari|Eternus, we put an end to the Legion attack on Dalaran. However, I'm still not certain how they managed to breach its defenses.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Our presence has already created anomalies in this timeline. The Legion's attack, our friend's intervention, and the artifact they wield.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Until recently, the [[bronze dragonflight]] would have done everything in their power to prevent divergences such as these.}}
:{{text|say|Moratari|But not anymore, right? After all, that is what we came here to do. Introduce changes to the past and observe the results as they occur.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|Indeed. These anomalies provide us with a unique opportunity to study the flow of [[time]] and the role of the individual in shaping history.}}
:{{text|say|Eternus|That being said, I promised [[Nozdormu]] that this experiment will eventually come to an end and that we will all depart from this timeline.}}
:{{text|say|Moratari|Well, then we'll simply have to make the most of the time we have, won't we?}}
:''Moratari teleports away.''
