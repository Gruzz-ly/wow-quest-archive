==Objectives==
[[Geranis Whitemorn]] wants you to swim to the bottom of the lake east of [[Suncrown Village]] and use the Bundle of Medallions on the [[Altar of Tidal Mastery]]. Summon and slay the elemental known as [[Aquantion]] and return to Geranis. 
*{{Mob|level=13|Aquantion}}  slain
*[[Bundle of Medallions]] (Provided)

==Description==
That willful [[elemental]] ended many lives that fateful day when he revolted against us. By calling to the lowly [[murloc]] to sabotage our rites he subverted our magic and turned it against us.

Show him our thirst for vengeance has not waned! Take these medallions and lay them at the [[Altar of Tidal Mastery]] at the bottom of the lake. Aquantion shall immediately answer your summons!

Beware, <race>! Without our magic controlling him, his wrath will be unrestrained. Destroy Aquantion so we may rest!

==Progress==
Has Aquantion been destroyed yet? 

==Completion==
You've avenged our deaths and broken Aquantion's grasp on our souls.  We may finally rest. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||11|}}
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|20}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City]]
*+1,000 reputation with [[Tranquillien]]
