==Objectives==
Slay 5 Eyes of Dar'khan, 6 Nerubis Centurions and 6 Wailers in [[Deatholme]] and return to [[Magister Idonis]] at the [[Sanctum of the Sun]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*[[Nerubis Centurion]]  slain (6)
*[[Eye of Dar'Khan]]  slain (5)
*[[Wailer]]  slain (6)

==Description==
If you seek to aid our cause there is no better place to start than here and no better time to do it than now.

By rebuilding the Sanctum of the Sun we've raised a banner of defiance in front of our enemy's seat of power: Deatholme.

Go forth and fight the hordes of undead that inhabit the vile [[Scourge]] fortress. 
==Completion==
The Scourge has felt our wrath, <name>. It won't be long before their cursed citadel lies in ruins.

With their numbers weakened, it is time to launch an attack on more strategic targets. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||25|}}
*1950 [[XP]] (or {{cost||12|}} at level 70)
*3000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
Have you returned from Deatholme victorious, <name>?

==Completion==
The Scourge has felt our wrath, <name>. It won't be long before their cursed citadel lies in ruins.

With their numbers weakened, it is time to launch an attack on more strategic targets.
