This quest is the entry to the '''The Farstrider Enclave''' quest chain. It is technically not a requirement to start the chain, but you cannot take this quest once you started the second quest.

==Objectives==
[[Magister Kaendris]], at the [[Sanctum of the Sun]], wants you to talk to [[Ranger Vynna]] at the [[Farstrider Enclave]] in the [[Ghostlands]].

==Description==
[[Magisters]] and [[Farstriders]] may not see eye to eye all the time, <name>. When it comes to [[Dar'Khan]], however, we're all in agreement that a way must be found to defeat him and his legions.

Ranger Vynna, at the Farstrider Enclave northeast of here, has come across important information regarding our enemy. Speak to her and see if you can be of assistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*575 [[XP]] (or {{cost||3|60}} at max level)

==Completion==
Kaendris sent you? I might have a task for you, <class>.

==Progression==
