==Objectives==
Bring back 10 Rotting Hearts to [[Magistrix Aminel]] in [[Tranquillien]].
* [[Rotting Heart]] x10

==Description==
I hear the [[Amani Empire|Amani]] [[troll]]s eat their enemies' hearts to steal their strength. They might just be on to something, <name>. With the proper treatment, the hearts of the unliving can produce potent elixirs. Hunt down the zombies that roam the [[Dead Scar]] and bring me their hearts. I'll show you the kind of enhancement we can perform to your physical prowess against the undead.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You receive|Scourgebane Draught|}}

You will also gain:
*1150 [[XP]]
*500 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
Do you have the zombie hearts I requested, <name>?

==Completion==
Take this draught, <name>.  After you drink it, your physical strength against the [[Scourge]] will receive a boost. If you need more than this sample bring me more hearts.

==Notes==
The items drop from [[Risen Hungerer]]s and [[Risen Stalker]]s in the Dead Scar. They are not soulbound and are not quest items (you can collect them when you don't have the quest).

After completion of this quest, you can take the repeatable quest [[More Rotting Hearts]], which does not grant XP.
