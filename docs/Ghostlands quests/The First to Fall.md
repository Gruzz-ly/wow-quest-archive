==Objectives==
Witness the fall of the first defenders.
* Shed light on the first battlefield
* Fight back the undead

==Description==
[[File:The First to Fall Arthas.jpg|thumb|Arthas surrounded by Unholy Aura. Entering or getting near it results in Arthas casting Death Coil!]]
[[Arthas]] cut through the land itself to get to the [[Sunwell]]. The [[Dead Scar]] is a constant reminder of that desecration. Where it starts is where our first line of defense attempted to hold the [[Scourge]] at bay. It is where the first blood was spilled.

It was a slaughter.

Take the lantern to the base of the Dead Scar, and use its light to reveal the memories of what happened there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Lor'themar stands quiet for a moment.>

From the gates, travel northwest to somewhat near the entrance to [[Deatholme]].
