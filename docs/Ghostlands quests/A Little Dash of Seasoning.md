==Objectives==
Poison the [[Forest troll|Troll]] foodstuff at the camps in [[Zeb'Nowa]] and then return to [[Apothecary Venustus]] at the [[Farstrider Enclave]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*[[Raw Meat Rack]] poisoned
*[[Smoked Meat Rack]] poisoned
*[[Fresh Fish Rack]] poisoned
*[[Apothecary's Poison]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm on loan to the [[Farstriders]] in an attempt to help with their troll difficulties. I believe that I have a solution to their problem.

At my disposal are a number of potent poisons. The trolls, as you know, are living creatures and therefore must eat. If we combine my poison with their food... well, I'm sure that the results will be entertaining!

Care to help rid us of the Shadowpine trolls at Zeb'Nowa to the south? The camp straddles both the north and south sides of the road to [[Zul'Aman]]. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||11|}}
*1450 [[XP]]
*+1000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
Isn't this exciting? I really do take great pride in my work; I hope you appreciate it, <class>.

So, I trust that you have 'seasoned' the food at the troll camps in Zeb'Nowa?

==Completion==
Ah, excellent! I knew that a <race>-delivery system would make for the most efficient application of the poison. With any luck the Shadowpine trolls will get fat on it before keeling over. That should get them off of the backs of the Farstriders, and me back to [[Tranquillien]].

It has been a pleasure working with you, <class>! 

==Notes==
*Be sure to use the poison once on each rack else the only way to get new poison is to abandon the quest.
