==Objectives==
Return to [[Lady Liadrin]] in [[Tranquillien]].

==Description==
Such power! Surely not even [[Vorath]] can withstand the might of this weapon now.

We have what we came to the [[Shadowlands]] for. The ranseur is ready.

Let's get back to Lady Liadrin in Tranquillien. I hope we're not too late to make a difference!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
Now that you have the empowered ranseur, it's time to show our full might on the battlefield.

Are you ready?

:{{Text|say|Vandellor|Strange... speaking with you, it is as if a long-forgotten memory flickers in my mind.}}
:{{Text|say|Salandria|Perhaps I remind you of my mentor, Lady Liadrin? She said she was adopted like me, by a man named Vandellor.}}
:{{Text|say|Vandellor|I do not recall. To better focus upon the service I perform, I let go of my mortal memories.}}
:''Vandellor salutes.''
:{{Text|say|Vandellor|Even so... it was a pleasure to meet you, young one. May your weapon serve you well.}}

:''Salandria runs away.''

It is possible to take the [[Portal to Tranquillien]] in the [[Hall of Blood]] instead of going to the flight master in front of Silvermoon City.
