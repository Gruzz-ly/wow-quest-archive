# Ghostlands storyline

[[File:WorldMap-Ghostlands.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]
'''[[Ghostlands]]''' is a level 10-60 zone in the [[Eastern Kingdoms]]. [[Blood elf]] characters are directed there by their questing experiences in the preceding [[Eversong Woods storyline (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods storyline]].

Completing the storylines here grants the achievement [[Ghostlands Quests]].

==Intro (starts in Eversong Woods)==
The first quest chain that takes you to the Ghostlands actually starts in Eversong Woods. You finish it in Tranquillien, the main quest hub in the zone.

{{:Missing in the Ghostlands/Quest chain}} or [[Warchief's Command: Ghostlands!]]

==Citizens of Tranquillien==

This part of the achievement requires completing many individual quests, which are unlocked by starting a quest chain that begins at [[Arcanist Vandril]] in [[Tranquillien]].

{{The Forsaken}}

Completing [[Suncrown Village (quest)]] unlocks the other quests in Tranquillien. It seems that completing them all is necessary for this part of the achievement.

In Classic, Rogues and Warlocks are likely to have the class quests they picked up back in Silvermoon City, and can complete here:

#[[Find Keltus Darkleaf]]
#[[Combining Forces]]
#[[Return the Reports]]

#[[Return to Talionia]] (breadcrumb from Undercity to Silvermoon City)
#[[The Stone]]
#[[The Rune of Summoning]]

Also in Classic, this is where you get an introduction to Flight paths:
