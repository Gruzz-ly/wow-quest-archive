==Objectives==
[[Apprentice Vor'el]] at [[Andilien Estate]] in the [[Ghostlands]] wants you to slay 10 Greater Spindlewebs and 10 Ghostclaw Ravagers. 
*[[Ghostclaw Ravager]] slain (10)
*[[Greater Spindleweb]] slain (10)

==Description==
[[Magister Kaendris]] sent me down here to clear the area of any hostile wildlife. Once this area is secured, the magisters plan to turn it into some sort of advance outpost against the [[Scourge]].

Now if there's one thing I've learned as an apprentice it's to delegate responsibility - especially in matters that endanger one's life!

If you're interested, I'll pay you well to kill the greater spindlewebs and ghostclaw ravagers to the west and south of here. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||20|}}
*1350 [[XP]] (or {{cost||8|40}} at level 70)
*1000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
Did you take care of the business we discussed, <name>?

==Completion==
Thanks for giving me a hand, <name>. I was dreading the thought of venturing into the woods this close to [[Deatholme]].
