This quest is part of the '''The Farstrider Enclave''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[The Farstrider Enclave]]

==Objectives==
Return to [[Ranger Vynna]] at the [[Farstrider Enclave]] with [[Dar'Khan's Journal]].
*[[Dar'Khan's Journal]] (Provided)

==Description==
As you skim through the pages in the journal you're overcome by an unnerving sense of being watched.

The contents are unsettling. [[Dar'Khan Drathir|Dar'Khan's]] soul was one filled with hatred and contempt for his own people. The extent of his machinations and plots are all documented in great detail.

Perhaps there is something here that Vynna will find useful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||8|}}
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|20}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
Tell me, <name>, what did you find out?

==Completion==
This information is very valuable, <name>. We all knew about Dar'Khan's plans to steal the power of the [[Sunwell]] for the [[Scourge]], but much of the information found here is completely new to us. [[Magister Kaendris]] at the [[Sanctum of the Sun]] will want to look at this.
