==Objectives==
Speak with [[Captain Helios]] at the [[Farstrider Enclave]] on the southern shore of [[Lake Elrendar]] in the [[Ghostlands]].

==Description==
I need one last favor of you, <class>. Just in case [[Ranger Salissa]] didn't make it back to Farstrider Enclave on the south edge of the lake, I need you to go there and get help.

Just check in with Captain Helios and let him know what's happened here. I'm sure he'll send help back as soon as he can.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Farstrider's Tunic
|Troll Handler Gloves
|Farstrider's Shield
|Farstrider's Chainmail
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 50 [[XP]]

==Completion==
That's dire news indeed—I completely overestimated [[Lieutenant Tomathren|Tomathren's]] ability to lead. I'll see to it that a group is dispatched to safely bring him and [[Ranger Valanna|Valanna]] back in.

Unfortunately, we never heard from Ranger Salissa, so I fear the worst in her case.

You've done the [[Farstriders]] a great service this day, <class>. Please take one of these as a small token of our appreciation.
