==Objectives==
Receive accolades from [[Lady Liadrin]] in [[Silvermoon City]].

==Description==
The power of the ranseur has been spent, but we are victorious! With [[Vorath]] defeated, perhaps the [[Scourge]] will be more easily dealt with--thanks to you.

Meet me back in Silvermoon. Your efforts and heroism today will not go unrecognized.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
*[[Ensemble: Blood Knight's Dedication]]
*[[Elusive Emerald Hawkstrider]]

==Completion==
Congratulations, and well earned.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|Are you two all right?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Salandria]]|Still standing. And... thank you for the shield. I think I may still have a few lessons to learn.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|One never stops learning, little phoenix. Come, let's get back to Silvermoon.}}
:Liadrin, Salandria, and Dawnheart walk away out of Deatholme.

Return to Silvermoon City by any means. In front of the Hall of Blood, paladins have gathered, cheering and clapping.

Inside, Salandria and [[Crusader Dawnheart|Dawnheart]] are kneeling in front of [[Lor'themar Theron]], Liadrin, [[Aethas Sunreaver]], and [[Rommath]].

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I will inform the [[Ebon Blade]] of what transpired. If the Scourge caused such problems here, I suspect matters in [[Northrend]] may be even worse.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|But regardless, your efforts must be lauded. When our lands were threatened, you stood strong and held the line.}}
:{{Text|say|Liadrin|You have demonstrated cunning, determination, and integrity. Hallmarks of what it means to be a Blood Knight.}}
:{{Text|say|Liadrin|Accept this gift as a symbol of your dedication and bravery. We will never forget that your aid was instrumental in ending this crisis.}}

:''Liadrin and Lor'themar cheer.''
