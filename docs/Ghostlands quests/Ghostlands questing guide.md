# Ghostlands questing guide

{{tocright}}
This '''questing guide for the zone of Ghostlands''' details an efficient method to obtain and complete the quests in [[Ghostlands]].

For a list of all Ghostlands quests in a sortable table, see [[Ghostlands quests]].

[[File:Icon-warning-22x22.png|Note]] '''Note''': The questing guides are not meant for power-leveling purposes. Rather, they are meant to show players the most efficient way to complete all quests available for a particular zone. If you know of a better order or method to accomplish this, your input is welcome (in fact, greatly desired). For major changes, feel free to edit, but make a note in the '''[[Talk:Ghostlands questing guide|talk page]]''' as to your reasoning.

== {{Horde_Icon}} Ghostlands (Level 10 - 20)==
[[Ghostlands]] is the zone most blood elves will quest in, once they leave from [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]]. It is also home to the instance {{I|Zul'Aman}}. The zone is connected to Eversong Woods in the north and Eastern Plaguelands in the south.

Other zone options for this level include [[Barrens]] and [[Silverpine Forest]].
