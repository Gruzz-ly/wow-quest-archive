'''Goldenmist Village''' is part of the ''The Forsaken'' [[quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Defeat 6 Quel'dorei Ghosts and 4 Quel'dorei Wraiths at [[Goldenmist Village]]{{coords|26|15|Ghostlands}}, and then return to [[Arcanist Vandril]] at [[Tranquillien]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*{{mob|level=10 - 11|Quel'dorei Ghost}}  slain (6)
*{{mob|level=11|Quel'dorei Wraith}}  slain (4)

==Description==
We've had one success, but there are two more villages that must be reclaimed!

Goldenmist Village is our next target. It lies to the northwest, and has been taken by the ghosts of the high elves that used to live there. Gruesome, I know, but these are apparently the sorts of tactics that the Scourge like to employ.

Go and defeat these ghosts and wraiths, <class>. Take the west road out of Tranquillien to get there. 

==Progress==
I've learned much about fighting the Scourge in the time that I've been here. They can be beaten back, but it must be done in small steps. The obscene manner in which they can take your fallen and add them to their own ranks as the newly risen makes it imperative that you make no mistakes along the way.

Now, how goes the fight against Goldenmist Village?

==Completion==
Your success at Goldenmist Village takes us another step closer to taking our land back. Don't fool yourself though, <class>; this fight is far from over.

Here, you've more than earned this. You may need it when you go up against [[Windrunner Village]]. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
{{Itembox||Goldenmist Special Brew|Quel'Thalas Recurve}}

*{{cost||4|}}
*875 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|40}} at level 70)
*1,000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progression==
{{The Forsaken}}

==Patch changes==
