==Objectives==
Kill 8 Shadowpine Shadowcasters and 8 Shadowpine Headhunters, and return to [[Farstrider Solanna]] at [[Farstrider Enclave]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*[[Shadowpine Headhunter]] slain (8)
*[[Shadowpine Shadowcaster]] slain (8)

==Description==
Our resources are spread pretty thin here, <class>, so your help is going to be invaluable. The captain has tasked me with overseeing the harassment of the local [[Shadowpine]] [[troll]] camps. We have a policy of keeping them off balance until the day when we can launch a brutal offensive to wipe them out.

Until then, we need all of the volunteers that we can get so that those Shadowpine troll numbers are decreased.

Think you could head east to [[Zeb'Tela]] and hurt them a little? 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||10|}}
*1350 [[XP]] (or {{cost||8|40}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
How are you doing with the attack on Zeb'Tela?

==Completion==
Good, good! You handled that very well! Let's see if you're up to something a little more difficult now.

I'm glad that you're here to help, <class>. The faster we can deal with these trolls, the faster we'll get to send the [[scourge]] back to where they came from.
