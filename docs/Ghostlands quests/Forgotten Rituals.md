==Objectives==
Bring 8 Wavefront Medallions to [[Geranis Whitemorn]] in the [[Ghostlands]].
*[[Wavefront Medallion]] (8)

==Description==
Every year we, the denizens of Suncrown Village, would take part in a ritual to keep the different aspects of nature under our control. Dominion over the element of water was symbolized by the summoning and enslavement of an elemental named [[Aquantion]]. Through a wicked perversion of our magic, the scoundrel broke his bonds and enslaved us instead!

We wore medallions shaped like waves during the ritual. Seek them at the bottom of the lake; we'll need them to free my compatriots' spirits!

==Rewards==
*You will receive:
*{{cost||5}}
*900 [[XP]]
*+1000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained the medallions, <name>? The drowned still haunt this lake!

==Completion==
With these necklaces we shall once again summon Aquantion. The rebellious elemental will pay and our deaths will be avenged!
