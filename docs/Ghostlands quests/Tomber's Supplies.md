==Objectives==
Retrieve Rathis Tomber's Supplies and return it to him at [[Tranquillien]] in the [[Ghostlands]].
* [[Rathis Tomber's Supplies]]{{coords|34|27|Ghostlands}}

==Description==
How am I supposed to supply the war effort when I cannot even safely get my supplies here? I was promised an escort that never came. And then, I had to leave one of my carts behind to the west when I was attacked by a band of [[ghoul]]s!

Want to help out, and get me open for business in the process? Go down the western road out of town and past the graveyard. On the other side of the [[Dead Scar]] is a fork in the road. The hill that my cart had to be left on lies just beyond.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||4}}
*875 [[XP]]
*1000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
Just as soon as I get the rest of my supplies, I'll be open for business. The forces here aren't going to get very far if they can't purchase what they need to ply their trades.

War zones can be such profitable places, wouldn't you agree, <class>? Now, did you manage to fight your way to my cart through all those ghouls?

==Completion==
With the rest of my supplies here, I can finally open shop. I'm sure that the high executor will be most pleased to hear that the war on [[Dar'Khan]] and the [[Scourge]] can commence.

And, of course, there's the small matter of your recompense. Very well, <class>, here is the coin that I alluded to. Do be sure to drop by should you find yourself in need of trade goods. 

==Notes==
The cart is difficult to spot in the dim light.  Go straight on from the fork just past the [[Dead Scar]], and it's at {{coords|34|27|Ghostlands}} surrounded by [[Gangled Flesheater]]s.

This quest must be completed in order to purchase trade goods from [[Rathis Tomber]] in Tranquillien.
