==Objectives==
Help [[Aethas]] and [[Rommath]] set up [[Protection Ward|defenses]] in [[Tranquillien]].
*Southeast Ward armed (1)
*Southwest Ward armed (1)
*North Ward armed (1)

==Description==
This is no mindless strike... I have a strong suspicion that some powerful entity is manipulating the [[Scourge]].

Ever since the [[Helm of Domination]] was shattered, there has been a conceivable risk that someone else could exert their will and assume control over the [[undead]]--at least temporarily.

Rommath and I can help defend Tranquillien, but we need to break those lines.

Clear a spot for us. Let us see if we can draw out their leader.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
Rommath and I are ready to help set up the wards, once you clear out a spot for us.

==Completion==
The wards are in place, and that should give us some breathing room.

But this san'layn has me worried.

==Notes==
;Southeast ward
:{{Text|yell|Vorath|Ah, the rabble have arrived!}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|A [[san'layn]], here? Take him down while we finish the ward!}}
:{{Text|say|Vorath|See you soon... Ha ha hahaha...}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|That's not very reassuring. Quickly, to the next ward!}}

;Southwest ward
:{{Text|yell|Vorath|I have overcome death!}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|There he is again! Put him down for good!}}
:{{Text|say|Vorath|Do you sense the futility yet?}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|One more ward to go. I suspect we'll soon have company.}}

;North ward
:{{Text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|Here he comes!}}
:{{Text|say|Vorath|You think to be rid of me so easily?}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|That's it! I Sensed a surge of [[magic]] coming from [[Deatholme]] at the moment of his demise. Let's get back to [[Liadrin]] and report what we have found.}}

;On return
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|Salandria, report your findings. What do we face at Deatholme?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Salandria]]|Even more Scourge than anticipated! But we managed to get close enough to look inside.}}
:{{Text|say|Salandria|That san'layn Aethas mentioned had some sort of crystal array. He kept appearing within it... almost as if summoned.}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Magister Rommath|That explains the surge of magic I sensed. That traitor has found a way to cheat his own death!}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Aethas Sunreaver|If we can overpower his safeguards, perhaps we can send his accursed soul to the [[Shadowlands]] for good.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|Then that is our next move. Upstairs there is a weapon. If infused with the proper power and wielded by worthy hands, it just might change our fortunes.}}

;Liadrin's gossip
:May the Light aid us.
:{{Gossip|What sort of creature is a san'layn?}}
::The san'layn are vampiric Scourge--a sect of [[darkfallen]] known for their guile and dark magic, particularly the manipulation of [[Blood magic|blood]] and [[Shadow (magic)|shadow]].

::Vorath clearly is working on his own, in the absence of the [[Helm of Domination]]. The weaker Scourge flock to the more powerful.

::If we can dispose of him, we can rout the rest.
