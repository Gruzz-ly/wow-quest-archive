==Objectives==
Light the first memorial's flame.
* [[Lamp|Light the First Flame]]

==Description==
Long has the southern wall separated [[Quel'Thalas]] from the once great [[kingdom of Lordaeron]]. We did not believe that anyone could breach it. That overconfidence was our undoing.

When the [[Scourge]] arrived, the gate was not conquered by force. It was willingly opened by [[Dar'Khan Drathir|a traitor]].

Though caught unaware, every [[Farstrider]], [[soldier]], and [[magister]] in the area rushed to the defense of our homeland. Very few of them returned home. The gates now stand as a memorial in their name.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
And now to walk their path.

==Notes==
After accepting the quest, follow the road south out of [[Tranquillien]] and straight on to the gates located in [[Thalassian Pass]].

;Using the [[lamp]]
:''The blood elf [[adventurer]] lights the first flame, channeling a spell that causes small phoenixes to fly from them towards the lamp.''
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|This is where the end began.}}
:''Lor'themar walks toward the entrance of the structure. Visions of two [[Silvermoon Defender]]s and a [[Silvermoon Ranger (heritage)|Silvermoon Ranger]] appear.''
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|My company was patrolling the forests near [[Zul'Aman]] when we received word of the Scourge invasion.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|We were wholly unprepared for what we encountered. Quel'Thalas had enjoyed years of idyllic peace. And suddenly, we were facing death itself.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I lost my eye in that battle... and would have lost my life were it not for [[Halduron]].}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Words cannot describe the devastation our people suffered that day. That any of us survived to tell the tale is a miracle. One that we cannot afford to waste.}}

==Trivia==
*[[Lor'themar Theron]] appears as a '''Farstrider Elite''' (a [[generic name]]) to other players.
