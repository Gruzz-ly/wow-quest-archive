==Objectives==
Slay 8 Deatholme Acolytes and 10 Fallen Rangers, and return to [[High Executor Mavren]] at [[Tranquillien]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*[[Fallen Ranger]] slain (10)
*[[Deatholme Acolyte]] slain (8)

==Description==
<class>, I want you to reclaim [[Windrunner Spire]]!

It's an honor, really. Windrunner Spire is the original home of Lady [[Sylvanas Windrunner]], queen of the [[Forsaken]] and former ranger-general of the elves. But now it's been overrun by the mindless [[Scourge]].

To get there take the road south until it branches. Take the right fork and after crossing the [[Dead Scar]] continue southwest. You can't miss it. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||7|}}
*1050 [[XP]] (or {{cost||6|60}} at level 70)
*1,000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
I trust that you return to me with news that Windrunner Spire has been cleansed of its Scourge infection?

==Completion==
I'm certain that Lady Sylvanas will be pleased to hear that we've made progress in the matter.

Here, take this coin as payment for your efforts.
