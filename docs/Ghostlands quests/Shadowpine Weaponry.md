==Objectives==
Collect 3 Headhunter Axes, 3 Shadowcaster Maces, 3 Catlord Claws and 3 Hexxer Staves. Return them to [[Captain Helios]] at [[Farstrider Enclave]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*[[Catlord Claws]] (3)
*[[Headhunter Axe]] (3)
*[[Hexxer Stave]] (3)
*[[Shadowcaster Mace]] (3)

==Description==
<Class>, I want you to kill as many [[Shadowpine]] [[Forest troll|trolls]] as you can. We need their numbers greatly reduced before we can shift our attention toward [[Deatholme]]. And while you're at it, we might as well kill two birds with one stone, so bring me back a load of their weapons. Better that they not go to waste, and we can use them in the fight against the [[Scourge]].

Hit their camps hard to the east and the south at [[Zeb'Tela]] and [[Zeb'Nowa]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||10|}}
*1350 [[XP]] (or {{cost||8|40}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
Have those weapons yet? With the Shadowpine numbers decimated we'll finally be able to turn our attention to the fight against the Scourge.

==Completion==
I'll immediately send a few [[Elven ranger|rangers]] out to survey the damage that you wreaked upon the Shadowpine trolls. I've no doubt that we'll be able to mop up after your offensive and launch an attack on the Scourge soon if these weapons are any indication of your success.

Here, I want you to take this coin in payment. It's burning a hole in my pouch anyway.
