==Objectives==
Speak with [[High Executor Mavren]] at [[Tranquillien]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 

==Description==
I know it seems strange, but the [[Forsaken]] are here to help. You should speak with their leader, [[High Executor Mavren]]. He's in the tower on the west side of town.

And, &lt;class&gt;, when you're done talking with him return to me; I have something dire that needs to be dealt with immediately!

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*85 [[XP]] (or {{cost|||60}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Completion==
We Forsaken are here because of a common enemy with the blood elves: [[Dar'Khan]]! He has returned and now commands the [[Scourge]] that are invading this land from his steadfast, [[Deatholme]], to the south.

Lady [[Sylvanas Windrunner]], who originally hails from these lands, and used to be an elf, has a history with Dar'Khan and wants him dead!

We will defeat him, &lt;class&gt;, and you will help us do it!
