This quest is part of the '''The Farstrider Enclave''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[The Farstrider Enclave]]

==Objectives==
Travel to [[Dawnstar Spire]] in the [[Ghostlands]] and search for any clues involving [[Dar'Khan Drathir|Dar'Khan's]] past.

==Description==
Dar'Khan Drathir is believed to have returned from the dead to rule over the armies of the [[Scourge]] in the Ghostlands. Dar'Khan aligned himself with the Scourge long ago... yet he was once a living, breathing [[elf]]. Much of his time was spent inside Dawnstar Spire, northeast of here. He hid there for many nights, scheming against his own. 

Search the tower for more information, <name>. Perhaps he had a journal or kept notes. One never knows where useful information might present itself.

==Rewards==
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|20}} at level 70)

==Completion==
After browsing through the first few pages of this old book, you come to the conclusion that it once belonged to the one known as Dar'Khan Drathir.
