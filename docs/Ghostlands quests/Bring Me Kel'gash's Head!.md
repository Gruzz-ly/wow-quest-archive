==Objectives==
Return the Head of Kel'gash the Wicked to [[Captain Helios]] at the [[Farstrider Enclave]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*[[Head of Kel'gash the Wicked]]

==Description==
WANTED: Bring the head of [[Kel'gash the Wicked]], chieftain of the [[Shadowpine]] [[troll]]s, to Captain Helios. No questions asked. Kel'gash is known to dwell somewhere to the south in [[Zeb'Nowa]].



REWARD: Yes, but no advances! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||25|}}
*1950 [[XP]] (or {{cost||12|}} at level 70)
*350 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]
{{itembox|You will be able to choose from:|Well Crafted Long Bow|Well Crafted Sword|Well Crafted Staff}}

==Progress==
What is that awful smell? 

==Completion==
Ah, Kel'gash's head is what smelled so bad. That's a nice piece of work there, <class>!

With their chieftain dead, the Shadowpine trolls should be in total disarray. Combined with your recent efforts to decimate their numbers, this should be the perfect opportunity to launch our counter-offensive against them and wipe them out for good.

You have my thanks, <name>. Might I interest you in one of these? 

==Notes==
*[[Kel'gash the Wicked]] can be found at the top of the building at the far south-east of the site{{co|65|80|Ghostlands}}. There's a path that runs there from the main camp.

==Patch changes==
