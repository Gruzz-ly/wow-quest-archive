==Objectives==
Slay [[Anok'suten]] and return to [[Arcanist Vandril]] at [[Tranquillien]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*[[Anok'suten]]  slain

==Description==
Come closer, I am ... dying.
I was sent here ... to slay these nerubians, but Vandril didn't ... know that they have a leader.

<The dying blood elf coughs up a good amount of blood.>

You must find and ... slay Anok'suten. Get help. She wanders around ... [[Suncrown Village]].

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fortified Oven Mitts
|Stung
|Vandril's Hand Me Down Pants
|Tranquillien Breeches
|Mix-Match Linked Pants
}}

You will receive:
*{{cost||4|}}
*875 [[XP]]
*1000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
A nerubian leader? None of the scouting missions reported anything about this Anok'suten!

==Completion==
I apologize for the shoddy intelligence, <class>. Had I known of this [[Anok'suten]] ahead of time, I surely would have told you.

We're spread too thin and things are slipping through the cracks! 

==Notes==
Anok'suten calls for help when her health goes low. If you try to solo this quest, make sure to clear the the area from adds before you confront her.
