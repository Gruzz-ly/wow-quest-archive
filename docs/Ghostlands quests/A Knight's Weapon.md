==Objectives==
Collect the Ranseur from upstairs in [[Tranquillien]].
*[[Forged Ranseur]]

==Description==
It's clear that [[Vorath|this san'layn]] has decided to use the [[Scourge]] to empower himself somehow. We can keep taking him out, but he will just keep coming back.

We need a weapon that can break him for good.

I think I have a solution. Upstairs, you will find a newly forged ranseur. It has yet to be tempered with [[magic]]--we will need to unlock its full potential. It will be our instrument of the [[Light]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}

==Progress==
Have you acquired the ranseur?

==Completion==
Good. That's exactly what we need.

Now it's time to temper this ranseur with enough power to destroy this san'layn once and for all.

==Notes==
Loot the ranseur from the [[Weapons Rack]] upstairs.
