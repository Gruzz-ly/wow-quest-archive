==Objectives==
Kill 10 Shadowpine Catlords and 10 Shadowpine Hexxers, and return to [[Farstrider Solanna]] at the [[Farstrider Enclave]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*[[Shadowpine Catlord]] slain (10)
*[[Shadowpine Hexxer]] slain (10)

==Description==
Time for something a little more challenging. [[Zeb'Nowa]], to the south, is where the more powerful [[Shadowpine]] [[troll]]s make their home. In our continuing effort to keep the troll numbers to a minimum I'm dispatching you to go down there and assail them by whatever means you have at your disposal.

What do you say, <name>? Ready to deal with some more trolls?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sentry Bracers
|Supple Cotton Bracer
|Farstrider's Bracers
|Farstrider's Cuffs
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
Is your assault on Zeb'Nowa complete already?

==Completion==
Unbelievable! You really should talk to the captain about joining up as a Farstrider.

Alright, <name>, you've given us the breathing room that we need to continue building up our forces here. Actually, by your account there aren't many of those trolls left at all! Maybe now we can join with [[Tranquillien]] and attack [[Deatholme]]?

I think you've earned a little something. Take your pick.
