==Objectives==
Light the second memorial flame.
* [[Tormented Ranger]] slain (6)
* [[Lamp (Windrunner Spire)|Light the Second Flame]]

==Description==
The next memory...

Forgive me. For many of our people, it was when we realized death was coming for us.

A memorial to a particular defender lies to the west, in the place of her home. The light there has no doubt attracted some of the area's lingering [[soul]]s. Clear them out, and then relight the flame.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] and the [[Farstriders]] sacrificed more than most of us. Sometimes I must remind myself of that fact, given the current state of affairs.

==Notes==
;Using one of the [[Lamp (Windrunner Spire)|lamp]]s
:''Channeling a spell that causes small phoenixes to fly from the player toward the lamps. Upon finishing, an echo of Sylvanas Windrunner, two [[Silvermoon Ranger (heritage)|Silvermoon Rangers]], and three [[Dragonhawk Rider]]s appear.''
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Sylvanas Windrunner was our kingdom's protector. Had she and her rangers not met Arthas with such fierce resistance, our people might no longer exist.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|She paid the ultimate price so that enough of us might escape to rebuild our fallen kingdom.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|When Arthas raised her as a [[banshee]] and turned her against Quel'Thalas, it broke all our hearts.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I've had my share of disagreements with Sylvanas... But I will never forget her sacrifice. She was the Ranger-General of Silvermoon. Nothing will ever change that.}}
