==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Amani Catacombs]] and burn 10 [[Mummified Troll Remains]], then return to [[Ranger Vynna]] at [[Farstrider Enclave]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*[[Mummified Troll Remains]] Burned (10)
*Investigate the Amani Catacombs
*[[Blazing Torch (Ghostlands)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Class>, our sources tell us that the trolls buried in the Amani Catacombs inside [[Sungraze Peak]] have been rising from the dead. I need you to investigate these catacombs and put to the torch any of the unanimated remains you come across so as to prevent any more of these creatures from rising.

The fastest way there is to head northwest out of the enclave. This will put you near the western entrance to the catacombs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||9|}}
*1,250 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|80}} at level 80)
*2,000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]
 
==Progress==
This is a most grim and undignified business, <class>. I trust that you will complete this task?

==Completion==
Disgusting, but necessary I can assure you. You have done us good service by investigating this matter, <class>. Please, take this as a token of our generosity and appreciation.

==Notes==
To complete this quest, you'll also need to "Discover the Amani Catacombs".  For this to register, you'll need to go to the circle room in the center-south{{co|63|31|Ghostlands}}.  Consider doing [[Escape from the Catacombs]] which is started with Ranger Lilatha who is inside this room.  It's an escort to the eastern exit.

;Description
<Class>, our sources tell us that the trolls buried in the Amani Catacombs inside [[Sungraze Peak]] have been rising from the dead. [[Dame Auriferous]] would have you investigate these catacombs and put to the torch any of the unanimated remains you come across so as to prevent any more of these creatures from rising.

The fastest way there is to head north out of town and then take the first fork to the right. This will put you on the north side of the peak, so look to the south for the entrance.

;Progress
This is a most grim and undignified business, <class>. I trust that you will complete this task to milady's complete satisfaction?
