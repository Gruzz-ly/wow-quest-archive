This quest is a prerequisite to several other quests.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[High Executor Mavren]] at [[Tranquillien]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 

==Description==
I know it seems strange, but these [[Forsaken]] are here to help. You should speak with their leader, High Executor Mavren. He's in the tower on the west side of town.

And, <class>, when you're done talking with him return to me; I have something dire that needs to be dealt with immediately!

==Rewards==
*85 [[XP]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Completion==
I know that we Forsaken appear monstrous to your eyes, but I assure you we mean your people no harm. We are here because of a common enemy: [[Dar'Khan]] the traitor! He has returned and now commands the [[Scourge]] that are invading this land from his steadfast, [[Deatholme]], to the south.

Our leader, [[Sylvanas Windrunner]], originally hails from these lands, and in fact used to be an elf. She has a history with Dar'Khan and wants him dead as much as your people do.

We will defeat him together, <class>! 

==Progression==

This quest is also a prerequisite for [[Tomber's Supplies]].
