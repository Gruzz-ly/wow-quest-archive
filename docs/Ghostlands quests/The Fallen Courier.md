==Objectives==
[[Apothecary Thedra]] in [[Eversong Woods (Burning Crusade)|Eversong Woods]] wants you to bring her 4 Plagued Blood Samples from beasts in the [[Ghostlands]].
*[[Plagued Blood Sample]] (4)

==Description==
What are you standing around for? Can't you see this boy needs immediate attention? By the looks of it, the plague is beginning to take over his body. Within minutes not even a master apothecary like me will be able to save him.

The animals south of the river all carry the plague in their blood. Go across the bridge and hunt the plagued beasts there. Bring me enough plagued blood samples and I'll distill a serum capable of saving this [[blood elf]]. Hurry!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*850 [[XP]]
*1000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
Well? Did you bring me what I need? Hurry, or the pretty blood elf boy is a goner!

==Completion==
Just in time, <name>! I was about ready to start digging a hole for our friend here.

My potion seems to be working; he's coming to.

Hey, I think he's trying to get your attention. Why don't you talk to him?

==Notes==
These can be found off the beat mobs just south in [[Ghostlands]]. The [[Mistbat]]s and [[Starving Ghostclaw]] are a good source.
