'''Culinary Crunch''' requires {{rep|Friendly}} or above reputation with [[Tranquillien]].

==Objectives==
Collect 5 Crunchy Spider Legs and return them to [[Master Chef Mouldier]] at [[Tranquillien]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*[[Crunchy Spider Leg]] (5)

==Description==
This is intolerable! I have nothing to work with here! Milady asks me to come from Silvermoon City; she deserves cuisine as befits her station. No? But I get here and there is no food. You must go out, &lt;class&gt;, and bring back fresh kills so that I have something to prepare.

Dame Auriferous prefers a crunchy texture to her food. There are plenty of spindleweb lurkers to the southwest on the other side of the Dead Scar. Disgusting, I know, but that's what we have to work with.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1050 [[XP]] (or {{cost||6|60}} at max level)
*[[Crunchy Spider Surprise]]
*[[Recipe: Crunchy Spider Surprise]]

==Progress==
I believe I can hear the dame's belly rumbling even from here! I take it that you are here talking to me because you have what I asked you to obtain?

==Completion==
Very well, these will have to do. No, don't describe them crawling around, I don't want to know! I'll work my magic upon these legs and they'll turn out quite tasty. A little spice here, a pinch of herb there, and then of course some arcane ingredients, and voila, a meal fit for a queen... or in this case, a dame.

Your service has been adequate, &lt;class&gt;. Here, take this recipe and some samples.
