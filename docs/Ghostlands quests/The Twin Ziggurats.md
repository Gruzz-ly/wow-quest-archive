This quest is part of the '''The Farstrider Enclave''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[The Farstrider Enclave]].

==Objectives==
Travel to the [[Bleeding Ziggurat]] and the [[Howling Ziggurat]] and recover the Stone of Light and the Stone of Flame. Return to [[Magister Kaendris]] at the [[Sanctum of the Sun]] after recovering the items.
*[[Stone of Light]]{{Coords|34|49|Ghostlands}}
*[[Stone of Flame]]{{Coords|40|48|Ghostlands}}

==Description==
According to this journal, [[Dar'Khan Drathir|Dar'Khan]] promised the [[Scourge]] two powerful elven artifacts: the stone of light and the stone of flame. These were imbued with the magical energies of the Sunwell and attuned to have warding powers against the Scourge.

The crystals were to be transported to where the Howling Ziggurat and the Bleeding Ziggurat now stand, in the middle of the [[Dead Scar]]. If they're still held there, we need to recover them. Their power will be greatly useful in our struggle against the enemy.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Sunwell Blade|Sunwell Orb}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||9|}}
*1,900 [[XP]] (or {{cost||11|40}} at level 70)
*+2,000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered the crystals yet?

==Completion==
The rumors were true! The stone of light and the stone of flame do exist! We shall use their power to create weapons against Dar'Khan.

Use them when the time is right and the energies of the [[Sunwell]], trapped within these objects, will vanquish him with the very power he sought to steal from us!
