==Objectives==
Deliver the Night Elf Plans to [[Magister Sylastor]] at [[An'telas]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
* [[Night Elf Plans]] (Provided)

==Description==
You must deliver the recovered night elf plans to An'telas for me. It is to the east, on the southern slopes of [[Sungraze Peak]], just to the northeast of the [[Sanctum of the Sun]].

Magister Sylastor is there conducting ongoing studies into the [[ley-line]] nexus energy for potential use in our fight against the [[Scourge]]. Have him look at these plans to shed some light on what it is that these [[Night elf|night elves]] are up to.
 
==Rewards==
*290 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|80}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
Oh, thank goodness for you! 

==Completion==
It was just horrible! Night elves! They conjured their [[Night Elf Moon Crystal|moon crystal]] here for some nefarious plot, but I snuck away and gathered a larger group of our scouts and casters from the nearby Sanctum of the Sun. We killed most of them and the rest of the group is hunting down the remnants!

I'm glad that you're here now; I was only left a couple of scouts for protection! It's not safe out here!

Give me a moment and I'll read through these plans to see what the night elves are up to. 

== Notes ==
On completing this quest, Magister Sylastor asks you to "Give me a moment and I'll read through these plans to see what the night elves are up to. ".  This starts a battle sequence, when two [[Night Elf Ambusher]]s , members of the [[Sentinel spies]], come in, saying "You won't get away this time!" and start to fight.  There are two guards to help you fight them.  On completion of the battle, Magister Sylastor says "Thank you very much! I don't know what I would have done if you weren't here!" and allows you to take the next quest, [[Deactivate An'owyn]]
