==Objectives==

*Investigate An'daroth{{coords|37|16|Ghostlands}}
*[[Sentinel Spy]] (12)

==Description==
<Class>, we are having difficulty with a [[Sentinel spies|group]] of [[Night elf|night elves]] that have recently taken over a nearby island. They've set up a small camp at the old [[high elf]] [[ley-line]] nexus, An'daroth, to the northwest. There is a dirt path that leads up to it just past the [[Dead Scar]].

I suggest that you lend us your aid by going there, investigating what they are up to, and slaying as many of the conceited night elves as you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Lesser Healing Potion]] x2
*{{cost||4}}
*875 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|40}} at level 70)
*1000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
It is very important that we find out what the night elves are up to, <class>.  Please concentrate your efforts towards that end.

==Completion==
Disappointing that the night elves' plans were not readily apparent at An'daroth. However, those objects that looked like small magically-grown trees with powered orbs atop them sound interesting. It would appear that we'll need to be more direct in our information gathering efforts.

Here, take this coin and these potions. I believe that you'll have use for them before we're done dealing with these night elves.
