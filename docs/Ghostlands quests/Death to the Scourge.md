==Objectives==
Slay Scourge in [[Tranquillien]].
*[[Scourge]] slain (15)

==Description==
I haven't seen Scourge mustering in numbers like this [[Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas|since]]...

<[[Liadrin]] shakes her head, steeling herself.>

Never mind. There's no use dwelling in the past.

Our first priority is thinning their numbers enough that we can find out what--or who--is really behind this attack.

Slay as many of the [[undead]] as you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}

==Progress==
Once we've thinned out the numbers of the Scourge, we can strike at [[Vorath]] in [[Deatholme|his lair]].

==Completion==
Well struck.

But for every undead we strike down, more come. We must find a way to stop them at their source.

==Notes==
Eligible targets include [[Rotting Shambler]]s, [[Eye of Vorath|Eyes of Vorath]], [[Deatholme Abomination]]s, and [[Fetid Ghoul (Ghostlands)|Fetid Ghouls]].

:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|Salandria, report your findings. What do we face at Deatholme?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Salandria]]|Even more Scourge than anticipated! But we managed to get close enough to look inside.}}
:{{Text|say|Salandria|That [[san'layn]] Aethas mentioned had some sort of crystal array. He kept appearing within it... almost as if summoned.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Grand Magister Rommath]]|That explains the surge of magic I sensed. That traitor has found a way to cheat his own death!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Archmage Aethas Sunreaver]]|If we can overpower his safeguards, perhaps we can send his accursed soul to the [[Shadowlands]] for good.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|Then that is our next move. Upstairs there is a weapon. If infused with the proper power and wielded by worthy hands, it just might change our fortunes.}}
