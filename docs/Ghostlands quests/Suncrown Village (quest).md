'''Suncrown Village''' is part of the ''The Forsaken'' [[quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Slay 10 Nerubis Guards and then return to [[Arcanist Vandril]] at [[Tranquillien]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*[[Nerubis Guard]] slain (10)

==Description==
We're surrounded here, <class>. The outlying villages have all been overrun by the [[Scourge]]!

You must head northeast to [[Suncrown Village]] immediately and deal with the [[nerubian]] Scourge menace. You can't miss them - they're spider-like creatures.

There's no time to waste.... [[Quel'Thalas]] must be reclaimed!

==Reward==
You will receive:
*{{cost||3|50}}
*850 [[XP]]
*1,000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
With your aid we'll get the Scourge problem contained, <class>. Dar'Khan will be dealt with!

Have you handled the nerubian problem at Suncrown Village yet?

==Completion==
Outstanding! But, there's much to be done before the Scourge menace is completely driven from mighty Quel'Thalas!

Here, take this coin... it's not much, but you've earned it. 

==Notes==
You might want to complete [[Anok'suten (quest)]] while you complete this quest.
