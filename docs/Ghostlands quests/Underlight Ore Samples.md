==Objectives==
Collect 6 Underlight Ore and deliver them to [[Magister Quallestis]] at the [[Sanctum of the Sun]] in the [[Ghostlands]].
*[[Underlight Ore]]

==Description==
I was sent here from the Sanctum of the Sun to collect some ore samples, but the [[gnoll]]s have overrun the place! It's going to be my head on a platter if I don't get those samples to the magister soon. Maybe you could help, <class>?

You can find the ore in the tin and copper veins here, and the gnolls are carrying it around, too. When you have enough, take it to Magister Quallestis at the Sanctum of the Sun directly to the east. Go across the Dead Scar and you'll find the sanctum just south of [[Sungraze Peak]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||6|}}
*975 [[XP]] (or {{cost||6|}} at max level)
*+1000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
How may I help you, <class>?

==Completion==
My apprentice was unable to take care of this herself? &nbsp;I shall have a word with her when she returns then, gnolls or not. &nbsp;Speaking of which, why didn't she return with you?

<The magister sighs.>

That one is a handful, and is going to be quite a challenge to properly train. &nbsp;Thank you, <class>, for bringing these samples to me. &nbsp;We are hoping that we can uncover some special property from them that will help in the fight against the Scourge.

Please take this coin as a token of my appreciation.

==Notes==
These drop off the [[Blackpaw Gnoll]]s in [[Underlight Mines]] of [[Ghostlands]], just to the west of the questgiver.  This quest is great to do at the same time as [[Trouble at the Underlight Mines]].
