==Objectives==
Return to [[Lady Liadrin]] in [[Silvermoon City]].

==Description==
The power of the ranseur has been spent, but we are victorious! With [[Vorath]] defeated, perhaps the [[Scourge]] will be more easily dealt with--thanks to you.

Meet me back in the [[Hall of Blood]]. Silvermoon is grateful for your bravery.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
*[[Elusive Emerald Hawkstrider]]

==Completion==
This is not the end of the Scourge, but it is gratifying to drive the threat from our lands with such tenacity.

Silvermoon is grateful for you this day.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|Are you two all right?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Salandria]]|Still standing. And... thank you for the shield. I think I may still have a few lessons to learn.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|One never stops learning, little phoenix. Come, let's get back to Silvermoon.}}
:Liadrin, Salandria, and Dawnheart walk away out of Deatholme.

Return to Silvermoon City by any means. In front of the Hall of Blood, paladins have gathered, cheering and clapping. In attendance are: [[Champion Bachi]], [[Mehlar Dawnblade]], [[Osselan]], [[Aenea]], [[Ithelis]], [[Champion Vranesh]], [[Blood Knight Argaron]], [[Master Pyreanor]], [[Knight-Lord Bloodvalor]], [[Champion Cyssa Dawnrose]], [[Sangrias Stillblade]], and [[Lord Solanar Bloodwrath]]. Inside, Salandria and [[Crusader Dawnheart|Dawnheart]] are kneeling in front of [[Lor'themar Theron]], Liadrin, [[Aethas Sunreaver]], and [[Rommath]].

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I will inform the [[Ebon Blade]] of what transpired. If the Scourge caused such problems here, I suspect matters in [[Northrend]] may be even worse.}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|But regardless, your efforts must be lauded. When our lands were threatened, you stood strong and held the line.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|Know that you have our gratitude, and that you set a shining example for the future.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Liadrin|For [[Quel'Thalas (kingdom)|Quel'Thalas]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Lor'themar Theron|For Quel'Thalas!}}
:''Liadrin and Lor'themar cheer.''

[[Salandria]] and [[Crusader Dawnheart]] will take permanent residence in the [[Hall of Blood]] following the quest's outro.

==Trivia==
*Unusually, the gathered NPCs outside use the previous IDs instead of having new IDs, such as those from {{Expac|Legion}} and {{Expac|The Burning Crusade}}. As such, Bachi is wearing the Silver Hand tabard, like that ID model does in the Sanctum of Light.

==Progression==
{{Knights of Blood}}
