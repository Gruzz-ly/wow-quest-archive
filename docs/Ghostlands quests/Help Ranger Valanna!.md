'''Help Ranger Valanna!''' is the entry to the quest chain of the same name. Though it is technically not a requirement for [[Dealing with Zeb'Sora]], you will not be able to accept this quest once you have started the second quest of this chain.

==Objectives==
Find [[Ranger Valanna]] and [[Lieutenant Tomathren]] on the shore of [[Lake Elrendar]] in the [[Ghostlands]] near [[Suncrown Village]].

==Description==
<Class>, I can't just sit here waiting for an audience with the high executor or [[Dame Auriferous]]! This cannot wait!

We were dealing with the [[Shadowpine]] [[troll]]s of [[Zeb'Sora]] to the northeast across Lake Elrendar. But the lieutenant mishandled the attack and we lost a lot of [[Farstriders]]. Then he just fell to pieces afterward. [[Ranger Valanna]] sent me here, and [[Ranger Salissa]] to the [[Farstrider Enclave]] for help.

Please find them, <class>. Valanna was badly injured and the lieutenant's useless. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*230 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|20}} at max level)

==Completion==
Good to hear that [[Ranger Lethvalin|Lethvalin]] made it to safety, and that he was smart enough to ask you for help instead of just waiting there.

I hope that Ranger Salissa made it safely to Farstrider Enclave. 

==Progression==
#[[Help Ranger Valanna!]]
