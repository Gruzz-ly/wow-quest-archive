==Objectives==
Bring 6 Plagued Murloc Spines to [[Apothecary Renzithen]] in [[Tranquillien]] in the [[Ghostlands]].
*[[Plagued Murloc Spine]] (6)

==Description==
To find a cure for [[Plague of Undeath|the plague]] we need to understand how it affects different creatures, from the most complex life forms to the lowliest subspecies.

I've come here to study the [[murlocs]] since, like us, they've retained free will in undeath. What makes these lowly mongrels so special? I need to find out, <name>!

Travel northwest and bring me their spines so that I may study the accumulation of plague in their marrow. Who knows what secrets their little bones hold? 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||6|}}
*900 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|40}} at max level)
*1000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]
*[[Swim Speed Potion]] x2
*[[Renzithen's Dusty Cloak]]

==Progress==
Have you obtained the specimens I asked of you, <name>? 

==Completion==
Excellent! These spines will be invaluable to my research! When I find a cure for the plague and word of my name spreads I'll make sure to make mention of you!

In the meantime, take these as a reward. You might need them if you decide to go back to the coast.
