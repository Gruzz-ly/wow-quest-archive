==Objectives==
Escort [[Ranger Lilatha]] to [[Captain Helios]] at [[Farstrider Enclave]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*Escort Ranger Lilatha back to the Farstrider Enclave
*Return to Captain Helios at Farstrider Enclave in Ghostlands

==Description==
These [[Forest troll|trolls]] ambushed me and have been keeping me in this cage. I think they're planning to sacrifice me! Help me get out of here!

The lock on the cage isn't that complex... I just can't get to it from this side. Please escort me back to the Farstrider Enclave. I'm sure Captain Helios will reward you, and you'll have my undying gratitude!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Troll Kickers (mail)|Troll Kickers (leather)|Troll Kickers (cloth)|Troll Kickers (plate)}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||9|}}
*1250 [[XP]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
You're the one that rescued my ranger?

==Completion==
You're quite the hero, <class>, to get her out of there alive. I suppose we'll have to mount an offensive to clear out those catacombs too. As if we didn't have enough trouble with the living trolls!

You've done a great thing today, I should reward you. Take your pick from any of these.
