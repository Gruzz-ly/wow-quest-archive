==Objectives==
Witness the fall of the Ranger-General.
* Light shed at [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]' fall
* Man a [[Silvermoon Ballista]]
* Kill [[undead]] (50)

==Description==
The Ranger-General fell just east of [[Fairbreeze Village]], where she was holding the line to protect the civilians as they retreated to [[Silvermoon]]. If it wasn't for her, our people would number even less than we do now.

Shine the lantern upon battlefield, and witness how her forces ultimately broke under [[Arthas]]'s personal assault.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
In the words of one of the more poetic retellings:

As her defenders fell, with anguish she cried: "[[Thalassian#Thalassian primer (official translations)|Shindu fallah na, Sin'dorei]]."

She was a true Ranger-General until her last breath. May Silvermoon never forget her bravery in life.

==Notes==
Return to [[Tranquillien]] and fly to Fairbreeze Village, then head east into the [[Dead Scar]] close to the [[East Sanctum]].
