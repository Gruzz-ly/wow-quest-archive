==Objectives==
Retrieve the Crystal Controlling Orb and then use it to deactivate the [[Night Elf Moon Crystal]] at [[An'owyn]]. Then return to [[Magister Sylastor]] at [[An'telas]] in the [[Ghostlands]].
*[[Crystal Controlling Orb]]
*[[Night Elf Moon Crystal]] Deactivated

==Description==
Their moon crystals are scrying devices—they're going to spy on us! I know that An'daroth can't provide enough power for that, but An'owyn, directly to the south, most definitely can!

From the plans I now have a basic knowledge of how these moon crystals work; enough to shut them down. They're keyed so that they can be turned off. You must go to An'owyn, retrieve the controlling orb from one of the night elves and then use it on the moon crystal to stop them from enacting their plan!

Hurry, <class>!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one from:|Sylastor's Cloak|Divining Crystal|An'telas Plate Shirt}}
You will receive:
*{{cost||16|}}
*1450 [[XP]] (or {{cost||9|}} at level 70)
*+1,000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
Is it over then, <class>? Did you deactivate the night elf moon crystal at An'owyn?

==Completion==
That's a relief, <class>! I can assure you that if you hadn't deactivated those scrying orbs we would be in a more tenuous position than the one we're already in! To think, surrounded by enemies, and [[Sentinel spies|one]] of them able to spy upon our every move!

But now we don't need to worry about that thanks to you! Here, take this, I want you to be rewarded for your efforts and I just happen to have a few things here that I no longer have any use for.

Thank you again, <name>! 

==Notes==
The [[Crystal Controlling Orb]] is a random drop from the mobs around the orb, which is located at {{coords|58|65|Ghostlands}}
