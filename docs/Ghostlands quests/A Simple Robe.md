==Objectives==
[[Arcanist Vandril]] wants you to bring him 15 Linen Cloth and a Spindleweb Silk Gland. 
*[[Linen Cloth]] (15)
*[[Spindleweb Silk Gland]]

==Description==
The arcane fragments you collected will do nicely.

Nicely for what, you ask? For making a splendid robe fit for a mage like yourself!

All we need now is some linen cloth and a spindleweb silk gland. You can find the silk gland from any [[Spindleweb Spider|spindleweb spider]], preferably after killing them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You receive|Manaweave Robe}}

You will also gain:
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|20}} at level 70)

==Progress==
The robe cannot be completed without the necessary supplies. But you knew that, didn't you? 

==Completion==
You really don't need to know the intricacies of crafting a magical robe, <name>, you just need to know what to bring me.

And let me be honest, you brought enough for several robes. The profit I'll make should more than cover the costs to make your robe, and even enough to buy myself something nice. Looks like the thanks belong to you!
