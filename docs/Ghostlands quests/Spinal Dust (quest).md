==Objectives==
Bring [[:Spinal Dust]] to [[Magistrix Aminel]] in [[Tranquillien]].
* [[Spinal Dust]] (10)

==Description==
The dark energy that flows through the bodies of reanimated skeletons tends to accumulate primarily in their spine. I've discovered a method of instilling this energy into a potion that boosts our magical abilities against the undead.

Bring me some {{loot|common|Spinal Dust|spinal dust}} and I'll be glad to provide you with a sample. You'll find an ample number of skeletons wandering the [[Dead Scar]], west of here.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You receive|Scourgebane Infusion|}}

==Progress==
Do you have the samples I requested, <Name>?

==Completion==
Take this, <name>. You'll feel the difference immediately!

Feel free to bring more spinal dust; I can use as much of it as you can provide. Side effects? You might start feeling your joints acting up a bit. Nothing permanent, I assure you!

==Notes==
*The items drop from [[Dreadbone Sentinel]]s, [[Dreadbone Skeleton]]s, [[Deathcage Scryer]]s, and [[Deathcage Sorcerer]]s in the [[Dead Scar]]. They are not soulbound and are not quest items (you can collect them when you don't have the quest) as they are also used for the repeatable quest [[More Spinal Dust]].
*Completing this quest allows you to do the repeatable quest [[More Spinal Dust]].
