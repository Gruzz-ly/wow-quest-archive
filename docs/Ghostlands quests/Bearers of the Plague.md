==Objectives==
[[Farstrider Sedina]] at the [[Farstrider Enclave]] in the [[Ghostlands]] wants you to slay 10 Ghostclaw Lynxes. 
*[[Ghostclaw Lynx]] slain (10)

==Description==
You show courage coming to the Ghostlands, <name>. There is much work to be done here and not enough brave souls to do it.

I've a thankless task to offer you, should you have the inclination to aid our cause. The very wildlife in this land has been tainted by the plague and we must stop it from spreading. Hunt the ghostclaw [[lynx]]es to the east and south of here and return when you've slain enough of them. 

==Reward==
You will receive:
*{{cost||6|}}
*975 [[XP]] (or {{cost||6|}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
Have you completed the task I asked of you, <name>?

==Completion==
You've done well, <name>. It's important that the plague doesn't spread to the healthy wildlife in [[Eversong Woods|Eversong]]. I have more work for you if you're looking for something to do.
