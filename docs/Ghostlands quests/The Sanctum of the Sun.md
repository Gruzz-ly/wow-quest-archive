==Objectives==
Speak to [[Magister Idonis]] in the [[Sanctum of the Sun]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 

==Description==
You've proven your loyalty to [[Tranquillien]] and have helped us defend it against the threat of the [[Scourge]]. Some of our most powerful magisters have come from [[Silvermoon]] to help us take the fight to the enemy's doorstep.

They've rebuilt the arcane sanctum to the south and have driven the Scourge away from the surrounding area. They plan to launch an offensive into [[Deatholme]], [[Dar'Khan]]'s stronghold. You would do well to join them, <name>. I'm sure they can make use of a seasoned <class> like yourself. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||6|}}
*775 [[XP]] (or {{cost||4|80}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Completion==
Darenis sent you? Very well, I suppose we can use your aid in fighting Dar'Khan's forces. 

==Notes==
At some point, the requirements for the quest that originally followed this one, [[War on Deatholme]], were changed to move it to a later point in the questline. The game still attempts to try to give that quest to the player, causing a "failure" sound to play, and a "You don't meet the prerequisites for that quest" error. Do not be alarmed.
