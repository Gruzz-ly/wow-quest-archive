==Objectives==
Meet [[Lor'themar]] in [[Tranquillien]].

==Description==
Every year, we ask a champion of our people to perform an act of remembrance in honor of those who fell to the [[Scourge]]. [[Lady Liadrin]] has performed this ritual, as have I, among others. This year, I am honored to give the task to you.

<The Regent Lord hands you an ornate lantern.>

This lantern carries a flame born of the [[Sunwell]]. I would ask that you bring it to locations that were significant to the fall of the Sunwell and of [[Quel'Thalas]], and to light the memories we cannot forget.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[File:Walk Among Ghosts lantern.jpg|thumb|The lantern.]]
This land will never recover from the damage that was done here. But we lost so much more than land that day.

==Notes==
