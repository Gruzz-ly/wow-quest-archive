'''The Lady's Necklace''' starts when a player activates the [[drop]] of the same name, which can be found in [[Windrunner Spire]]. This is the first quest of the "Lady's Necklace [[quest chain]]", which will lead the [[blood elf]] player from [[Tranquillien]] to [[Undercity]] and later to [[the Sepulcher]] in [[Silverpine Forest]].

==Objectives==
Take The Lady's Necklace to [[High Executor Mavren]] at Tranquillien in the [[Ghostlands]].
*[[The Lady's Necklace]] (Provided)

==Description==
The necklace shimmers, a remarkable piece of jewelry that doesn't seem to succumb to the gloom that permeates the Ghostlands. Given the inscription, and where you found it, it must be the lost property of Lady [[Sylvanas Windrunner]] herself!

Perhaps it would be best to first take it to High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien? He seems to be the highest ranking [[Forsaken]] in the area and is sure to know what to do with it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||14|}}
*1050 [[XP]]
*1000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
What's that you have there, <name>?

==Completion==
You say that you found it on one of the [[Scourge]] at Windrunner Spire and that there's an inscription on it? Let me see!

Here, take this coin for a job well done.
