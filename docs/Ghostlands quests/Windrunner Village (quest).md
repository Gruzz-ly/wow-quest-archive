'''Windrunner Village''' is part of the ''The Forsaken'' [[quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Gather 6 Phantasmal Substance and 4 Gargoyle Fragments. Return them to [[Arcanist Vandril]] at [[Tranquillien]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*[[Phantasmal Substance]] (6)
*[[Gargoyle Fragment]] (4)

==Description==
<name>, the final battle against the Ghostlands villages is upon you. [[Windrunner Village]]{{coords|17|43|Ghostlands}} to the southwest has been overrun by a large force of the more powerful [[Scourge]] shocktroopers; shades and gargoyles. You will be the spearpoint of our offensive by thinning out their numbers.

The magisters at the nearby [[Sanctum of the Sun]] have made a special request this time; they want the remains from these Scourge to study in hopes of finding creative ways of fighting them.

Good hunting! 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Arcanist's Dagger
|Salvaged Plate Leggings
|Padded Running Shoes
|Arcanist's Wand
|Relinked Chain Boots
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||1|10}}
* 250 [[XP]]
* +3,000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
<Class>, has Windrunner Village been liberated? Those damned magisters at the Sanctum of the Sun have been berating me to get their hands on those Scourge remnants I asked you to gather.

Don't worry about that, though. You take your time and get the job done right. I'll deal with the magisters.

==Completion==
You've done it, <name>. You've broken the Scourge hold on the three villages! Now we can focus our forces with greater ease against the Scourge on the [[Dead Scar]] and south at [[Deatholme]].

Here, take your choice of any one of these. I trust that you're not going anywhere? We can really use your continued assistance!
