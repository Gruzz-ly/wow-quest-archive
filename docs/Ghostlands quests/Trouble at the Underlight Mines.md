==Objectives==
Slay 8 Blackpaw Gnolls, 6 Blackpaw Scavengers and 4 Blackpaw Shaman, and return to [[Deathstalker Maltendis]] at [[Tranquillien]] in the [[Ghostlands]].
*[[Blackpaw Gnoll]] slain (8)
*[[Blackpaw Scavenger]] slain (6)
*[[Blackpaw Shaman]] slain (4)

==Description==
The Underlight Mines to the southwest have been overrun by a clan of [[gnoll]]s calling themselves the [[Blackpaw clan|Blackpaw]]. I don't need to remind you how important those mines are to us as a strategic asset in our ongoing campaign here in the Ghostlands!

Take the south road out of town and follow the fork to the right. Just past the [[ziggurat]] on the right there will be a short dirt path to the west. Follow it.

The ore must flow!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||6|}}
*975 [[XP]] (or {{cost||6|}} at max level)
*+1000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
Is it good news, or bad, darling?

==Completion==
That's a fair job of butchery you managed there, <class>. We'll get the miners back to work now. I'm sure they'll be disappointed that their break is over, but there's armor and weaponry to be made, and that requires ore to be mined.

Here, take this as payment for doing your duty. Go get your armor and weapons repaired, and have a drink on me.

==Notes==
This quest is great to do with [[Underlight Ore Samples]]
