'''Journey to Undercity''' has players bring their necklace to Sylvanas Windrunner in Undercity.

==Objectives==
Take The Lady's Necklace to [[Lady Sylvanas Windrunner]] at the [[Royal Quarter]] in [[Undercity]].
* [[The Lady's Necklace]] (provided)

==Description==
This is quite extraordinary! It appears to be a gift to Lady Sylvanas Windrunner from her sister, [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]]!

You must take it to her in the Undercity at once! The lady holds court in the Royal Quarter.

To get there, use the [[Orb of Translocation|orb of translocation]] in the [[Inner Sanctum (Silvermoon City)|Inner Sanctum]] of [[Sunfury Spire]] in [[Silvermoon City]] to cross over to the Undercity. Once there, take the elevator ride down into the city proper. Use your maps if you need help finding the Royal Quarter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1350 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
And you are?

What's that you have there? That necklace looks somehow familiar. Give it here! 

==Completion==
<Sylvanas takes the necklace from your grasp.>

It can't be! After all this time, I thought it was lost forever.

<After a lingering moment the Lady seems to become aware once again of her surroundings, composing herself.>

You thought this would amuse me? Do you think I long for a time before I was the queen of the [[Forsaken]]? Like you, it means nothing to me, and Alleria Windrunner is a long dead memory!

<She drops the amulet to the ground.>

You may now remove yourself from my presence, <class>.

==Notes==
After completion, Sylvanas will start to sing a song called [[Lament of the Highborne]] while present NPCs turn to face her.

:{{Text|whisper|Ambassador Sunsorrow|That could have gone better. <Name>, come here, please. I have something I need you to take care of for me.}}

Afterward, talk to [[Ambassador Sunsorrow]] to receive a copy of the lyrics.
