==Objectives==
[[Magister Idonis]] wants you to venture into [[Deatholme]] to slay Masophet the Black, Jurion the Deceiver, Borgoth the Bloodletter and Mirdoran the Fallen. Report back to him in the [[Sanctum of the Sun]] in the [[Ghostlands]] after you've completed this task. 
*[[Borgoth the Bloodletter]] slain
*[[Jurion the Deceiver]] slain
*[[Masophet the Black]] slain
*[[Mirdoran the Fallen]] slain

==Description==
The odious traitor, [[Dar'Khan]], has risen to great power among the ranks of the [[Scourge]]. His lieutenants command vast armies of undead against our dwindling numbers.

Masophet the Black, Jurion the Deceiver, Borgoth the Bloodletter, Mirdoran the Fallen. Learn these names well for in the Ghostlands these Scourge leaders are second only to Dar'Khan himself. Slay them and their mindless armies will be thrown into disarray.

==Completion==
Dar'Khan's armies will soon fall. The Scourge shall not stand a chance against the combined might of the [[sin'dorei]] and the [[Forsaken]].
