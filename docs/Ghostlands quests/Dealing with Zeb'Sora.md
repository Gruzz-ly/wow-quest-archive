==Objectives==
Collect 6 Zeb'Sora Troll Ears and return them to [[Ranger Valanna]] in the [[Ghostlands]].
*[[Zeb'Sora Troll Ear]] (6)

==Description==
The lieutenant here rushed us into battle with the trolls across the lake instead of scouting the situation first. We were decimated by his stupidity! You hear me [[Lieutenant Tomathren|Tomathren]]? You're an idiot!

Will you help us, <class>? Those trolls still need to be dealt with. I need to stay here and nursemaid him—I think he's lost his mind.

Just head east to the other side of the lake into [[Zeb'Sora]]. I want revenge... bring me their ears so that I can fashion a nice necklace!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*900 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|40}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Progress==
You get those [[troll]] ears yet?

You know, if we could get some help from [[Tranquillien]] every once in a while this wouldn't be such a problem. I'm just glad that you're here.

==Completion==
I appreciate your efforts, <class>! Thank you. Now, we can say that this expedition and all the lives lost on it haven't been in vain.
