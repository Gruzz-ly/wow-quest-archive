This quest is part of the '''The Farstrider Enclave''' quest chain.  This quest chain starts with [[The Farstrider Enclave]].

==Objectives==
Slay [[Dar'Khan Drathir]] inside [[Deatholme]] and bring his head to [[Magister Kaendris]] at the [[Sanctum of the Sun]] in the [[Ghostlands]].
*[[Dar'Khan's Head]]
*Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
Everything we've done in the Ghostlands has been done with the goal of taking back what is rightfully ours. The [[Scourge]] have maintained their chokehold on the region for far too long.

The time has come for payback, <name>. Thanks to your help and the help of our new allies, the [[Forsaken]], vengeance will soon be ours.

He who sought to steal the power of the Sunwell must die. Go to Deatholme, the Scourge stronghold south of the [[Dead Scar]]. Bring me Dar'Khan's head and your deeds will go down in history!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Staff of the Sun

==Progress==
Is it done, then? Has Dar'Khan been destroyed?

==Completion==
Today you've dealt a deadly blow to the Scourge's grasp in the region.

With the vile traitor gone, it shall not be long before we've reclaimed our lands and our greatness is restored once again.
