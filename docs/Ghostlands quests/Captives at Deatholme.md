==Objectives==
Take Janeda's Restorative Draught to [[Deatholme]] and rescue Apprentice Varnis, Apothecary Enith and Ranger Vedoran. Return to [[Arcanist Janeda]] at the [[Sanctum of the Sun]] for a reward.
*{{npc|Horde|Apothecary Enith}} Rescued
*{{npc|Horde|Apprentice Varnis}} Rescued
*{{npc|Horde|Ranger Vedoran}} Rescued
*[[Janeda's Restorative Draught]] (provided)

==Description==
Ah, yes. I possess a draught that will break most forms of alchemically induced stupor.

Side effects include confusion, nausea and - in rare cases - temporary blindness. All much preferable to whatever the [[Scourge]] plans to do to those prisoners in Deatholme, if you ask me.

Best of luck, brave <class>. You are going to need it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||25}}
* 1950 [[XP]]
* 3000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
What became of the prisoners in Deatholme? Have you ventured there yet? 

==Completion==
Excellent job, <name>. Without your help those prisoners would've lost their minds and souls to the Scourge.

==Original version==
{{Classic only-section|tbc|patch=8.0.1}}

This quest originally had a lead-in [[A Restorative Draught]] from Arcanist Janeda, which explained the plight of the prisoners and sent players to a Tranquillien apothecary to get the draught. He then directed players to the rescue, after which they returned to Janeda.

*Quest giver: [[Apothecary Renzithen]]
;Description
: Ah, yes. One of my finest creations. This draught will break most forms of alchemically induced stupor.

: Side effects include confusion, nausea and - in rare cases - temporary blindness. All much preferable to whatever the Scourge plans to do to those prisoners in Deatholme, if you ask me.

: Best of luck, brave <class>. You are going to need it.

The new version combines the two quests: Janeda skips that initial explanation and immediately talks about the draught, already in her possession, and sends players players directly to Deatholme.

==Notes==
;Apothecary Enith
<The Forsaken female is curled up on the floor, her face in a grimace. She does not appear capable of getting up on her own at the moment.

{{Gossip|Administer the restorative draught.}}

Ahhhhggg... this pain in my head is killing me.

They must've sent you to rescue me. Took them long enough! Do you have any idea of the things they do to prisoners here?

{{Gossip|A bit ungrateful, aren't we? The way out is clear, flee quickly!}}
:{{Text|say|Apothecary Enith|Thanks, I should've never left [[Silverpine Forest]].}}

;Ranger Vedoran
<The blood elf lies on the floor in some manner of induced torpor.>

{{Gossip|Administer the restorative draught.}}

<The blood elf quickly regains consciousness as you pour the draught into his mouth.>
I owe you my life, <class>. Without your help I would've succumbed to the Scourge's painful torture.

{{Gossip|You're free to go now. The way out is safe.}}

:{{Text|say|Ranger Vedoran|You have my thanks!}}

;Apprentice Varnis
<The blood elf lies limp on the table. While he's still breathing, he appears to have been the victim of potent sedative toxins.>

{{Gossip|Administer the restorative draught.}}

<Varnis coughs violently as the restorative draught takes effect.>

Thank you for rescuing me. I must go back to Tranquillien at once!

{{Gossip|You're free to go now. The way out is safe.}}

:{{Text|say|Apprentice Varnis|Th... thank you.  I thought I was going to die.}}

Despite the update, [[Apothecary Renzithen]] still has the option to be asked for another draught.
{{Gossip|I seek a sample of your restorative draught, apothecary.}}
