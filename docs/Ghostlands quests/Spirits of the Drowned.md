==Objectives==
[[Ranger Krenn'an]], at the [[Farstrider Enclave]] in the [[Ghostlands]], wants you to kill 8 Vengeful Apparitions and 8 Ravening Apparitions in the nearby lake. 
*[[Ravening Apparition]] slain (8)
*[[Vengeful Apparition]] slain (8)

==Description==
The lake to the north has been haunted by the [[ghost]]s of my ancestors for as long as I can remember, &lt;name&gt;. The poor souls were victims of a tragic incident in which scores of them drowned at the bottom of the lake.

The details of the event are mostly forgotten, but their haunting cries serve as a constant reminder of their curse.

If you're up to the task, I want you to go to the lake and put an end to their suffering, &lt;name&gt;. You will have my gratitude as well as theirs... I'm sure.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||5|}}
*900 [[XP]] (or {{cost||5|40}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Progress==
You've done what I asked of you, <name>?

==Completion==
I appreciate your help, &lt;name&gt;. &nbsp;It pains me to see the spirits of my ancestors in their pitiful state. &nbsp;May they finally get the rest they deserve.
