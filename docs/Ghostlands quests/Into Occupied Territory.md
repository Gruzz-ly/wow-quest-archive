==Objectives==
Steal the [[Night Elf Plans: An'daroth]], [[Night Elf Plans: An'owyn]] and [[Night Elf Plans: Scrying on the Sin'dorei]], and return them to [[Dame Auriferous]] at [[Tranquillien]] in the [[Ghostlands]]. 
*[[Night Elf Plans: An'daroth]]{{coords|14|27|Ghostlands}}
*[[Night Elf Plans: An'owyn]]{{coords|13|24|Ghostlands}}
*[[Night Elf Plans: Scrying on the Sin'dorei]]{{coords|10|23|Ghostlands}}

==Description==
Now, the more direct course of action that we are going to take, to figure out what these night elves are really up to, is to have you go to their island and steal any information that you can come by.

I want you to head west down the road out of town to [[Shalandis Isle]], just off the coast. Go there and recover any plans they might have on the island or on their ship.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||6|}}
*975 [[XP]] (or {{cost||6|}} at level 70)
*1000 [[reputation]] with [[Tranquillien]]

==Progress==
How fare our efforts to uncover the night elf plot on Shalandis Isle, &lt;class&gt;? 

==Completion==
Troubling! These plans show the [[Sentinel spies|night elf forces]] at [[An'daroth]], which we already knew, but also at [[An'owyn]], a more remote [[ley-line]] nexus to the southeast.

There is a third nexus to the east, which is not mentioned, named [[An'telas]]. I have a very bad feeling about all of this, &lt;class&gt;.

==Progression==
#[[Investigate An'daroth]]
#[[Into Occupied Territory]]
#[[Deliver the Plans to An'telas]]
#[[Deactivate An'owyn]]
