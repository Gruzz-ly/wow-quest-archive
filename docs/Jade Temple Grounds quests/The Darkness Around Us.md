[[File:Lingering Doubt.jpg|thumb|[[Lingering Doubt]].]]
Kill 15 [[sha]] invaders.
*Sha invaders slain (15)

==Description==
Despite our best efforts, the sha broke the seals around the main temple.

If we cannot hold them back here, their darkness will spread to the rest of the [[Jade Forest]].

We need your help immediately. Kill any sha creatures that you see. They should not be difficult to find

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
We are holding ground, but just barely.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Every sha slain is another turn in the tide.

==Notes==
Pick up the other sha-invasion daily quests before heading out: [[Hidden Power]] and [[Saving the Sutras]].

Head north past the main entrance to the practice areas, as there are more friendly NPCs to help out. The sha spawn rate is very, very high, so be careful. Help the defenders kill sha and toss a sutra in their direction. The other sutras Storm-Sing is looking for are littering the grounds up at the three practice areas.
