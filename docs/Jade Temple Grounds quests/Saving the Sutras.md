==Objectives==
Collect 6 Ancient Sutras.
*[[Ancient Sutra]] (6)

==Description==
My adepts had to abandon their studies when the sha invasion began.

Unfortunately, they left their books scattered around the temple grounds. These priceless works of knowledge must be saved!

The sutras can be found near the Training Pit and the Adept's Ring to the northeast.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
How are the sutras? Are they damaged?

==Completion==
Thank you! What a relief to see these texts are safe.

==Notes==
Pick up the other sha-invasion daily quests before heading out: [[The Darkness Around Us]] and [[Hidden Power]].

Head north past the main entrance to the practice areas, as there are more friendly NPCs to help out. The sha spawn rate is very, very high, so be careful. Help the defenders kill sha and toss a sutra in their direction. The other sutras Storm-Sing is looking for are littering the grounds up at the three practice areas.
