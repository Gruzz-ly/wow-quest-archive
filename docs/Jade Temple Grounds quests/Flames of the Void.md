==Objectives==
Fly your War Serpent near Pure Water Springs, then douse 6 Void Flames with the water carried in its mouth.
*[[Void Flame]]s doused (6)

==Description==
Do you see the violent black and white flames erupting all around the temple?

The greater our doubt, the stronger they rage. Unchecked, they will devour the entire temple.

We have but one hope.

Take flight on one of our war serpents. Fly it near the pure springs of water, and then douse the fires with water from the pools.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
These fires burn unlike anything in our world.

==Completion==
You have done much to help curb the fires. Thank you for your efforts.

==Notes==
The serpent is right outside the building. Hop on, then look to the water. Try to target the serpent such that the character's body is hit by the pure water, not the serpent's mouth.
