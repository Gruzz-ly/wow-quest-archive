==Description==
Our war supplies grow low, but especially needed are additional arrows.

We need someone to brave the battlefields and retrieve any undamaged arrows to refill our stores.

Every arrow you retrieve will be used wisely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:

*+250 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find any arrows?

==Completion==
These arrows are still in good shape. They will fly straight and true.

Great work, <name>.
