==Objectives==
Collect 8 Masks of Doubt.
*[[Mask of Doubt (quest item)]] (8)

==Description==
The sha may seem unstoppable, but this is not true.

Their masks seem to be the source of their power. When a sha and its mask are separated, the creature's essence is banished back to its own realm.

Bring me intact masks, for I wish to study them further. Do be careful. I'm sure the sha will not part with them easily.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Please handle the masks carefully. If you are not careful, they will attempt to consume you.

==Completion==
I suspect these masks allow the sha to make a physical connection to our world.

I must study them further if we are to banish these creatures forever.

Thank you, <name>. Your aid is greatly appreciated.
