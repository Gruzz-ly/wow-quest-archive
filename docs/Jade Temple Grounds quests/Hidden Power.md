==Objectives==
[[File:Yu'lon Guardian.jpg|thumb|[[Yu'lon Guardian]].]]
[[File:Yu'lon Adept.jpg|thumb|[[Yu'lon Adept]].]]
Deliver Ancient Mantras to 6 [[Yu'lon Guardian]]s or [[Yu'lon Adept]]s.
*Ancient Mantras delivered x8
*[[Stack of Mantras]] (provided)

==Description==
Our temple defenders have battled relentlessly for hours. No doubt they grow tired.

I will give you mantras to deliver to our fighters.

Do not be fooled by these pieces of paper. These ancient scriptures hold words of untold power.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[August Celestials (faction)|August Celestials]]

==Progress==
Words hold great power. Use them wisely.

==Completion==
The sha's numbers are unending, and our numbers few. But we are not daunted by difficult odds.

Thank you for doing your part to protect our home, <race>.

==Notes==
Pick up the other sha-invasion daily quests before heading out: [[The Darkness Around Us]] and [[Saving the Sutras]].

Head north past the main entrance to the practice areas, as there are more friendly NPCs to help out. The sha spawn rate is very, very high, so be careful. Help the defenders kill sha and toss a sutra in their direction. The other sutras Storm-Sing is looking for are littering the grounds up at the three practice areas.
