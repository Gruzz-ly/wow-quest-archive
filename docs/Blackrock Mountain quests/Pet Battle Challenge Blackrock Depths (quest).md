==Objectives==
Stop the Shadowy Figures.
* Ask [[Burt Macklyn]] to open the Stratholme service entrance.

==Description==
Those Shadowy Figures are up to no good again, are you sure you want to face them? If you really want to go back in there, I'm not going to stop you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Shadowy Gem]]

==Progress==
I can teleport you back in there, but you're on your own once you're inside. Good luck.

==Completion==
Amazing, you stopped them! Who knows what crazy things they would have done had we not intervened, and at just the right moment. Well done!
