==Objectives==
Attempt to find [[Wrathion]] in [[Blackrock Mountain]].
*[[Unscarred Black Scale]] (provided)

==Description==
<An utterly pristine black dragon scale taken from the dragons you recently encountered.

The [[black dragonflight]] was completely decimated following [[Deathwing|Deathwing's]] demise and Wrathion's rise to power.

Yet the size indicates a younger dragon.

There is one person, one dragon, that you know will want to hear of this, but where IS Wrathion?

You surmise he may be some place familiar, fortified, and abandoned.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (700x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hello, I was told to expect you, Kindly hand over the scale.

We will, of course, compensate you.

First in information. Have you heard of the [[Dragon Isles]]? Few have, and fewer have been there.

We have not found others of the master's kin... forthcoming in information.

Should you uncover anything further in your travels, we will be awaiting a visit, with payment in kind.

And second, in this [[:Azerite]] you are seeking. Here, a hefty sum for your troubles.

==Notes==
The [[Blacktalon Agent]] is found outside the entrance of [[Blackwing Descent]] on [[Blackrock Mountain]].

This quest is required for [[Tell Me A Tale]].
