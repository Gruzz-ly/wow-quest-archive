== Objectives ==
Kill 7 Murloc Tidehunters and 7 Murloc Oracles.
*[[Murloc Tidehunter]] slain 7
*[[Murloc Oracle]] slain x7

== Description ==
You probably noticed all of the shipwrecks along the coast. The Great Sea is treacherous indeed. The coast of Westfall needs to be kept clear, so that if sailors find their way to our beaches, they are safe. The Murlocs are trouble though.

Kill murloc tidehunters and oracles and I will see to it that you are rewarded. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

== Progress ==
Kill 7 Tidehunters, and 7 Oracles and I will see to it that you are rewarded.

== Completion ==
Well done, <name>.  You have quite a knack for combat. Thanks to you the Coast of [[Westfall]] is a safer place.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Keeper of the Flame]] and [[The Coastal Menace]] before heading out.

Murlocs are all along the longshore, so kill murlocs heading up the coast to the chasm, collect the oozes, then return down the longshore, killing murlocs along the way, past the lighthouse to the southernmost murloc camp, where Murk-Eye awaits. Kill him then head back to the lighthouse.
