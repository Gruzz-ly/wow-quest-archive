==Objectives==
Escape the [[Defias Hideout]].
*Defias Hideout escaped

==Description==
I should have known. I lost control of the [[Defias Brotherhood|Brotherhood]] the moment those pardons were offered. Anyone with principle is long gone.

It's only the brutes left, now. And [[Duncon Ratsbon]] was always the biggest brute of them all.

Let's get out of here, <name>. If any of these fools try to get in our way, let's teach them a lesson about standing in the path of a VanCleef.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*6,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It feels odd and yet... this feels a long time coming.

Since fighting the [[Burning Legion|Legion]], I've felt distant from the Brotherhood. More aid started to trickle into [[Westfall]], and while it will never be enough... the spark of revolution dimmed.

...Or maybe I'm just getting older.

Still, I once thought of myself as someone who stood up for the people. I made mistakes, I hurt them... but who else do they have?

I need to do better, not for the Defias, but for Westfall.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|You're slow, and I want to get out of here. Take this elixir, let's go!}}

You can use the '''VanCleef's Elixir of Speed''' extra action button, granting stealth and 100% movement speed.

Moving up towards the exit and then when reaching the Hideout, a [[Defias Thief (Westfall)|Defias Thief]] leaps from the shadows:
*{{Text|Say|Defias Thief|Is this enough "principle" for you, VanCleef?! Give me your coin!}}
*{{Text|say|Defias Thief|Hand over all your coin!}}
*{{Text|Say|Defias Thief|Never trust [[Stormwind]]!}}

;Reaching Shaw
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|The Brotherhood has turned against me. [[Count Clessington|Clessington]] and Duncon Ratsbon lead them to attack [[Northshire Valley|Northshire]], and then Stormwind itself.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Mathias Shaw|Master Mathias Shaw]]|Northshire? They'll wipe out the new recruits posted there!}}

==Progression==
