During this quest, Vanessa appears with the generic name '''Defias Thief'''. During combats, she also grants Weight of a Feather and Alchemical Vial buffs.

;Entering Moonbrook
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|Ah, the smell of straw and cow dung... this place brings back a lot of memories.}}
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|It's probably been a while for you too, huh? But then again, have you ever seen this place through the eyes of a Defias?}}

;Entering the Defias Hideout
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|When [[Edwin VanCleef|my father]] led the Brotherhood, he followed a path of banditry and vengeance. I lead them in order to overthrow a corrupt government that abandoned us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|At least, I thought I did. But I followed the same path. I let the people of [[Westfall]] down.}}

;Walking down the stairs
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|During the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] invasion, we fought for something greater. The [[Varian Wrynn|old king]] died, and it became hard to carry on old grudges.}}

;Entering the mine
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|[[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] offered pardons and reparations for former [[Stonemasons Guild|Stonemasons]] and their families. I lost almost all of my best people that day.}}

;Further in
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|The ones that remained in the Defias were the rowdy ones. The angry ones. The ones that enjoyed robbing anything in sight.}}

;Taking a wrong turn
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|Ugh, I think we took a wrong turn. I've always hated what a maze this place is.}}

;Further still
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|I'm also angry. I'll never forget my father's death. But in my own attempt at revolution, I hurt the people of Westfall. Like [[Stormwind]] did. Like [[Onyxia]] did.}}

Finally, [[Count Clessington]] is found with [[Duncon Ratsbon]] in front of a crowd of [[Defias Thief (Westfall)|Defias Thieves]].

:{{Text|Yell|Duncon Ratsbon|No reparation is enough! The Stonemasons deserve every coin in every coffer of Stormwind city! Clessington will lead us there!}}
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|Duncon?! You weren't even a Stonemason! You joined to be a [[thief]]!}}
:{{Text|Say|Duncon Ratsbon|So you finally show yourself, VanCleef. And with a Stormwind dog in tow! See, Defias? See how she will make us all lapdogs of Stormwind?!}}
:{{Text|Yell|Count Clessington|We muster in [[Northshire Valley|Northshire]]! Join us, and we march on Stormwind! For the Defias!}}
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|[[Drakefire Amulet|The amulet]]!}}
:''Count Clessington'' charges the powers of the amulet and opens a portal to Northshire Valley.''

The present thieves all run through the portal.
:{{Text|Say|Defias Thief|For the Defias!}} ''(11x)''
