==Objectives==
Bring 5 Chasm Oozes to [[Captain Grayson]] at the [[Westfall Lighthouse]].
*[[Chasm Ooze]] (5)

==Description==
The night the Lighthouse Keeper's family died was horrible. I watched, helpless, as [[Old Murk-Eye]] led the attack. But what's done is done and now my concern is for the lives of the sailors on [[Great Sea|The Great Sea]] whose ships come close to the perilous rocks of the coastline. With no one to keep watch on the flame the responsibility has fallen upon me.

Help me keep the torch lit by bringing me chasm ooze from the slimes in the Raging Chasm to the northeast. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Minor Mana Potion|Minor Healing Potion|q1=3|q2=3}}

You will also receive: {{cost||6}}
{{Itembox||Scroll of Intellect|Scroll of Stamina}}

==Progress==
The flame will not burn for long without ooze, <name>. We used to use oil back in the day, but it was hard to come by! 

==Completion==
Praise you, brave <class>. The rocks of the Westfall Coast shall be lit thanks to your hard work. Many lives will be spared so long as the torch is kept lit.

I died needlessly on this very shore. My afterlife plight is to see that no others follow my destiny. 

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Coast Isn't Clear]] and [[The Coastal Menace]] before heading out.

Murlocs are all along the longshore, so kill murlocs heading up the coast to the chasm, collect the oozes, then return down the longshore, killing murlocs along the way, past the lighthouse to the southernmost murloc camp, where Murk-Eye awaits. Kill him then head back to the lighthouse.
