== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Lieutenant Horatio Laine}} at the [[Jansen Stead]] in [[Westfall]].

== Description ==
;From NPCs
:Westfall has fallen to hard times, friend. With the threat of the [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]] extinguished, the region has become a haven for the homeless and downtrodden. The crime rate of the area has skyrocketed as people fight for shelter and food. Now I hear tale of murder!

:If you are interested in helping the people of the [[Alliance]], Westfall would be a great place to start. Report to Lieutenant Horatio Lane at the Jansen Stead. You'll find Westfall directly west of [[Elwynn Forest]].

;From the [[Hero's Call Board]]
:By order of his royal highness, {{NPC||Varian Wrynn||King Varian Wrynn}}, all able-bodied citizens of the [[Alliance]] are to report to Lieutenant Horatio Lane at the Jansen Stead.

:Westfall has been overrun by beggars and transients, leading to a massive increase in criminal activity. Your help is needed to restore order to the populace. You can reach the Jansen Stead in Westfall by traveling west from Elwynn Forest.
:For the glory and honor of the Alliance!

== Completion ==
Murder, rookie. That's what you're looking at on the ground in front of us.

== Notes ==
This is the breadcrumb to Westfall, offered at level 9 from various questgivers, including:
*{{NPC||Marshal Dughan}} in Goldshire {{co|42.1|65.9|Elwynn Forest}}
*{{NPC||Guard Thomas}} in Elwynn Forest {{coords|73.9|72.2|Elwynn Forest}}
*{{NPC||Marshal Patterson}} {{co|81.83|66.01|Elwynn Forest}} and {{NPC||Marshal Haggard}} {{coords|84.4|69.6|Elwynn Forest}} at [[Eastvale Logging Camp]]
*{{NPC||Deputy Rainer}} at [[Westbrook Garrison]], Elwynn Forest {{co|24.2|74.5|Elwynn Forest}}
*The [[Hero's Call Board]]s in Stormwind City

At the Jansen Stead, {{NPC||Farmer Furlbrow}} and {{NPC||Verna Furlbrow}} have been killed! Even {{NPC||Old Blanchy}} was not spared. As players walk up to the crime scene, some dialogue happens between the {{NPC||Stormwind Investigator}}s and {{NPC||Horatio Laine||Lieutenant Horatio Laine}}:
:{{text|say|Stormwind Investigator 1|It's a bloodbath, lieutenant. They've been murdered.}}
:{{text|say|Stormwind Investigator 1|Given the body temperature, I'd say they've been dead no more than 6 hours.}}
:{{text|say|Stormwind Investigator 2|Damn shame what they did to Old Blanchy...}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|No kidding, rookie...}}
:''Laine walks over to Old Blanchy and kneels.''
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|Looks like they really put the cart...}}
:''Laine slowly puts on a pair of red sunglasses.''
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|...before the horse.}}
:''Laine stands and returns to his spot.''
:''A {{NPC||Transient}} and a {{NPC||West Plains Drifter}} walk up across the bridge from [[Elwynn Forest|Elwynn]].
:{{text|say|Transient|What the hell happened here?}}
:{{text|say|West Plains Drifter|Looks like the Furlbrow's were murdered...}}
:{{text|say|Transient|What's happened to us?  We're in worse shape now than when the [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]] ran amok!}}
:{{text|say|West Plains Drifter|Yep.  That {{NPC||Varian Wrynn||King Varian}} is good for nothin'.}}
:{{text|say|Transient|Let's get out of here before they try and pin this on us.}}
:{{text|say|West Plains Drifter|Good call.}}
:''They take a wide berth around the crime scene and continue on the road toward [[Sentinel Hill]].
