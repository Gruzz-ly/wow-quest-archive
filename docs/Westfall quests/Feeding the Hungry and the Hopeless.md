==Objectives==
Use the Westfall Stew to feed 20 Homeless People around [[Sentinel Hill]] in [[Westfall]].
*Westfall Homeless fed x20
*[[Westfall Stew (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Yes, I heard about the Furlbrow murders.  It is very tragic, but such tragedy is a way of life in [[Westfall]].  There are many people here who simply no longer have the means or inclination to keep themselves fed.  They have given up hope.  Do you understand what it means to be left so hopeless as to stop caring about life?  We must work together to show them that there is hope.  That with the dawning day a better life comes.

Take [[Salma Saldean|my mother's]] Westfall stew and help feed the homeless around Sentinel Hill.

==Progress==
Have you fed the homeless?

==Completion==
You have a kind heart, <name>.  You have done a good thing, today, and that act will reflect back upon you when judgment day comes.

==Notes==
[[File:Feeding the Hungry.jpg|thumb|A satisfied customer.]]
The ideal place to do this is around {{coords|57|57|Westfall}} at the southern gate where the refugees are amassed and throw garbage at the guards who try to push them back. However, there are homeless citizens all around the perimeter of Sentinel Hill. They shouldn't be hard to find.

Note that once feed any given NPC will have a buff on them for a bit that says they've been fed, and an icon will show above their head. They cannot be counted again until this buff goes away. If someone else is doing the quest and/or you have saturated the market, it might be more efficient to wait a couple minutes rather than run around searching for hungry citizens.
