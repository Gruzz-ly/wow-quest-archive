== Objectives ==
Return the Harvest Watcher Heart to {{NPC||Farmer Saldean}} at {{NPC||Saldean's Farm}}.
*[[Harvest Watcher Heart]] (provided)

== Description ==
You have found what appears to be the heart of a {{NPC||harvest watcher}}.

From the sound being emitted by the device you can tell that it's still fully functional.  Perhaps you should return it to Farmer Saldean.

== Progress ==
What have you got there, <name>?

== Completion ==
Is that...  Is that the heart of one of the watchers?  I've heard stories about using one of these to power up a watcher for personal use.  Of course I'm really in no shape to try such things myself.

== Notes ==
The watcher heart drops from the {{NPC||Harvest Watcher}}s in the field of [[Saldean's Farm]].

==Progression==
{{Westfall storyline}}
