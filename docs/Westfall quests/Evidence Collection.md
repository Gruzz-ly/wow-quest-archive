== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Red Bandanas.
*[[Red Bandana (quest item)]] x6

== Description ==
The material of {{item|Red Bandana|this bandana}} is identical to the material found at the Furlbrow murder scene. You should collect more red bandannas as evidence and return what you find to {{NPC||Captain Alpert}}.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gregorky's Bracers
|Worn Defias Bracers
|Evidence Collection Gloves
|Worn Defias Bindings
}}

You will also receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
Red bandanas?!

== Completion ==
I haven't seen a red bandana in five years. Could this shadowy figure be attempting to reform the [[Defias Brotherhood]]?

== Notes ==
Bandannas drop from {{NPC||Moonbrook Thug}}s while players are ostensibly on the quest [[Propaganda]].

==Progression==
{{Westfall storyline}}
