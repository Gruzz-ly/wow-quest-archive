==Objectives==
Meet [[Monte Gazlowe|Gazlowe]] and [[Mathias Shaw]] on the upper stairs of the [[Scrapshop]] in [[Undermine]].
* Take the portal to Undermine (optional)
* Meet Gazlowe on the Scrapshop's upper stairs
* Take Renzik's ashes
* Spread Renzik's ashes

==Description==
[[Renzik "The Shiv"|Renzik]] would want his ashes returned to Undermine. I know that for certain, and I would like to do my friend one last favor by seeing it done.

I'm sure he'll like it far more than being stuffed under a marble slab in the [[Stormwind]] [[Stormwind City Cemetery|cemetery]], far away from his people.

Let's go, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Knowin' he always thought of Undermine as a home...

That's somethin'. I could've learned a lot more from him.

==Completion==
Renzik's home now.

We'll make sure it never gets taken from him again.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Mathias Shaw and Monte Gazlowe turn to each other.''
:{{Text|Say|Mathias Shaw|We should bring Renzik back to Undermine. Back to his home.}}
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Yeah. Yeah, that sounds right.}}
:''The duo take the Portal to Undermine.''

Follow them to arrive at the [[Scrapshop]], where Mathias Shaw and Monte Gazlowe are upstairs:
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|Undermine looks a lot different up here. A lot brighter.}}

Speak with Monte Gazlowe:
{{Dialogue|You saw us through this mess and got us out the other end.

[[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] would be doin' this to a lot more good people if you hadn't helped stop him.

Do me one more favor, champ?

:{{Text|Say|Mathias Shaw|You knew him too, <name>. Go ahead.}}

While holding Renzik's ashes, players gain an extra action button: {{Abilities|Spreading Ashes|id=474433|Spread Renzik's ashes across Undermine.|icon=rogue_dirtytricks}}

Use it and let the cast finish:
:{{Text|Say|Monte Gazlowe|...see you 'round, boss.}}
