== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Captain Alpert}} at [[Moonbrook]] in [[Westfall]].

== Description ==
We have had a camp near Moonbrook for quite some time now, <name>.  One of my best soldiers works the area along with a company of [[Sentinel Hill]] troopers.  Report to Captain Alpert now and find out if he has any news about the happenings in Moonbrook.

Another ally of mine is also at the Moonbrook camp.  His name is {{NPC||Thoralius the Wise||Thoralius}}.  I met Thoralius in [[Northrend]] during my time at [[Valgarde]].  He is a wise and powerful [[shaman]].  Perhaps his abilities could help us solve this mystery.

== Completion ==
The natives are restless, <name>. I don't know what's going on, but homeless activity in this area has quadrupled in the past two days. If I didn't know any better I'd say they were planning something...

== Notes ==
If you have not already done so, set your hearthstone to Sentinel Hill, so that you can hearth straight there after going down into the [[Deadmines]].

Head southwest to Moonbrook. North of town is a flight master and the quest NPCs.
