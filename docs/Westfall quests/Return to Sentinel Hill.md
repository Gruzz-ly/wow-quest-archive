==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Gryan Stoutmantle||Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle}} at [[Sentinel Hill]] in [[Westfall]].

==Description==
The [[Defias Brotherhood]] are not a force to be taken lightly, <name>. What you witnessed was the birth of a ruthless organization of criminals that will stop at nothing to see [[Stormwind]] turned to rubble.

I need you to return to Sentinel Hill and let Gryan know that we are sending him troops. I hope it's not too late.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[XP]]
*+10 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Completion==
Five years of work burned to the ground in five minutes. Damn the Defias!

And this is only the beginning, <name>! We have a long, hard road ahead of us.

== Notes ==
Sentinel Hill is now fully on fire and most of the NPCs have relocated.  The tower now functions as the inn and all of the named NPCs, with the exception of {{NPC|Steam Tank Mechanic|Twilber Torquewrench}} are either by the flight master or in the tower. Defias {{NPC||Defias Pillager||pillagers}}, {{NPC||Defias Knuckleduster||knuckledusters}} and {{NPC||Defias Henchman||henchmen}} are trying to kill everyone.

==Progression==
{{Westfall storyline}}
