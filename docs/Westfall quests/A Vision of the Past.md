==Objectives==
Enter the [[Defias Hideout]] and follow the trail of homeless to the [[Deadmines]] dungeon. Enter the Deadmines [[dungeon]] and use the Incense Burner to see into the past.
*Vision of the Past uncovered
*Return to Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle at Sentinel Hill in Westfall.
*[[Incense Burner]] (provided)

==Description==
This incense will put your body and mind in a deep meditative state. Once the trance begins you will be pulled into the spirit world. Do not fight the trance once it has begun, <name>. Allow the spirits to show you what they know.

You must leave now. Go to the Deadmines, a place which I am told holds great significance in the history of [[Westfall]]. Once inside, use the incense.

You may enter the Deadmines through the old farmhouse south of here. Follow the homeless.

Return to [[Gryan Stoutmantle|Gryan]] with your discovery.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

==Progress==
What have you found out, <name>?

==Completion==
WHAT? VanCleef had a daughter?

==Notes==

Before going down to the entrance of the Deadmines, you may want to go back to Sentinel Hill and set your [[hearthstone]] there, so that you can hearth there instead of running all the way back out to Moonbrook.

Enter the instance (you may need to set dungeon difficulty to Normal on a high-level character) and use the incense burner right where you appear in the instance, next to the portal.

The Vision of the Past shows what happened five years in the past. As the vision pans around Ironclad Cove, showing everyone dead, it circles around the ship to VanCleef's area...

:{{text|yell|Alliance Warrior|There's nowhere left to hide, VanCleef! The Defias are THROUGH!}}
:{{text|yell|Alliance Warrior|We're here to finish this! Face us, coward!}}
:{{text|yell|Edwin VanCleef|None may challenge the Brotherhood!}}
:{{text|emote|Defias Blackguard jumps out of the shadows!}}

:{{text|yell|Edwin VanCleef|Lapdogs, all of you!}}
:''At 50%''
:{{text|emote|Edwin VanCleef calls more of his allies out of the shadows.}}
:''At 25%''
:{{text|yell|Edwin VanCleef|Fools! Our cause is righteous!}}
:''At 10%''
:{{text|yell|Edwin VanCleef|The Brotherhood shall prevail!}}
:''The party finishes VanCleef off.''
:{{text|yell|Alliance Warrior|Victory for the Alliance! Glory to Stormwind!}}
:{{text|say|Alliance Warrior|Let us return to Sentinel Hill, allies, and inform Gryan of VanCleef's demise!}}
:''The Alliance party jumps off the ship heading toward the exit... However, a surprise comes walking out of VanCleef's room... as a little girl steps out, crying as she reaches VanCleef.''
:{{text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|Daddy...}}

Gryan's reaction should be echoed pretty much everywhere...

==Trivia==
The party of five Alliance adventurers is a reference to the original, pre-''Cataclysm'' [[Deadmines (Classic)|Deadmines dungeon]], where Edwin VanCleef was the final boss. The intent of the developers was to replicate the appearance of a Deadmines dungeon run in vanilla ''WoW'', complete with a full party of five "players", and the hunter using [[mana]] rather than [[focus]], as hunters did before ''Cataclysm''.

However, some anachronisms are seen in the encounter: the rogue uses [[Shadowstep]], which was only added in [[patch 2.0.3]] (and at level 60, at that), and the party wears capital city tabards ([[Stormwind Tabard]] and so on) that were only added with the [[Argent Tournament]] in [[patch 3.1.0]], and the earliest point they could possibly be wearing these tabards at level 17 is [[patch 4.0.3a]] (when they were added to capital city vendors; however, that was also the patch that removed the original Deadmines dungeon and added this very quest).
