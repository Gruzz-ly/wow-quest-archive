==Objectives==
Defeat Old MacDonald in a pet battle.
*Defeat [[Old MacDonald]]

==Description==
You're tough for just starting out!

[[Old MacDonald]] taught me everything I know about battling. I think fighting him would be a great learning experience for you!

He can be found just across the bridge leading to [[Westfall]]. Don't let his age fool you, he's already beaten quite a few up-and-coming trainers like yourself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|40|}}
*80 [[XP]]
*[[Sack of Pet Supplies]]

==Progress==
You must think you're a real ace, don't you?

==Completion==
Well, I can't argue with results like those. You've got a real gift, <name>.

==Progression==
{{Pet Tamer}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 5.0.4|note=Added.}}
