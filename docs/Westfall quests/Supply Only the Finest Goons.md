==Objectives==
Slay 16 Clessington Attendants in the [[Defias Hideout]] in [[Moonbrook]].
*[[Clessington Attendant]] slain (16)

==Description==
These "attendants" of my [[Count Clessington|father]]'s attacked us the moment we arrived!

These are certainly not the kindly servants I had as a child. These are hired killers!

If my father is planning what I think he's planning... we can't let them do this. They will kill everyone in their way.

<Cecilia winces.>

If it's kill or be killed...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*6,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I wish there was more I could do to help. I've never regretted it more that I didn't pick up my father's skills in the [[arcane]].

==Completion==
I hope their souls find peace. I wish it didn't have to be this way.

==Progression==
{{Lion's Heritage}}
