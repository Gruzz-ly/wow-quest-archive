== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Farmer Saldean}} at [[Saldean's Farm]] in [[Westfall]].

== Description ==
So what do we know so far? We need to follow the clues.

Over at the [[Jansen Stead]] you found a {{item|Murloc Clue|water-soaked letter}} and some {{item|Riverpaw Gnoll Clue|scraps of red cloth}}. Here at the [[Furlbrow's Pumpkin Farm|Furlbrow's]] you [[Livin' the Life|overheard a conversation]] between some shadowy figure and an {{NPC||Glubtok||ogre mage}}. You also get [[Lou's Parting Thoughts|a confession]] from a bunch of {{NPC||Thug||thugs}} - whom you then killed.

Something isn't adding up, rookie.

There's an old couple, southeast of here, at the Saldean's Farm. Head over there and speak with Farmer Saldean. Find out what he knows.

== Completion ==
{{NPC||Horatio Laine}}? That man is a scumbag. Dirty as my underwear.

Listen, friend. I don't often give out advice like this, but you seem like a good <man/woman>. GET OUT OF WESTFALL. You're already in way over your head. All you're doing now is putting your neck on the chopping block.

== Notes ==
Saldean is still affiliated with Stormwind, but it may not be that way for much longer...
