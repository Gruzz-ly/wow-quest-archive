== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Captain Grayson}} at the [[Westfall Lighthouse]] in [[Westfall]].

== Description ==
Have you heard of Captain Grayson? Some say that he's the figment of a drunken sailor's imagination, but anyone in Westfall will tell you that Grayson is real! He's a ghost that haunts the Westfall Lighthouse far to the west, off the coast of the [[Longshore]].

Do you dare investigate?

== Completion ==
Aye... I used to be flesh and blood, just like you, <lad/missy>. That is, until that fateful day when the murlocs attacked the lighthouse...

== Notes ==
Far, far to the southwest past [[Moonbrook]].
