== Objectives ==
Eavesdrop on the [[Thug]]s out behind the farmhouse at [[Furlbrow's Pumpkin Farm]] in [[Westfall]].
*Eavesdrop on Thugs.

== Description ==
[[File:Thugs at Pumpkin Patch.jpg|thumb|The thugs behind the building]]
A couple of thugs recently showed up at the farm, causin' all kinds of trouble. I don't know where they came from or who they're working for, but I KNOW they're bad news. I may have overheard 'em talkin' 'bout subjects that might interest you.

If you're interested, you'll find the thugs back behind the farmhouse. If you get caught or killed, I don't know you. Never seen ya!

Good luck, kid.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||5}}

== Completion ==
We're dealing with an organization here, rookie. You don't just off the richest bum in Westfall in broad daylight and leave no witnesses. Someone with a lot of power is behind these murders. What have you learned so far?

== Notes ==
Run behind the barn. It's necessary to round the corner to start the script event.

:{{text|say|Thug 2|Yep.  She's for real.}}
:{{text|say|Thug 2|She wanted me to tell you lugs that she appreciates the job that we did for her on the Furlbrows.  Gave me a pile o' gold to split with you all.}}
:{{text|say|Thug 3|See her face?  Is it really...}}
:{{text|say|Thug 1|Whoa, what do we have here?  Looks like we have ourselves an eavesdropper, boys.}}
:{{text|say|Thug 1|Only one thing to do with a lousy, good-for-nothin eavesdropper.}}
:{{text|say|Thug 1|DIE!}}

The four thugs turn hostile. Once all four are dead...
:''Two gunshots suddenly ring out and a woman screams!''
:{{text|bossemote|Hurry back to the Furlbrow's Cottage!}}
Back up front, Laine's arrived and his investigators are yelling at three homeless Stormwind citizens because... Lou's dead!
:{{text|say|Stormwind Investigator|You were standing right here!  What the hell did you see?  Speak up!}}
:{{text|say|Homeless Stormwind Citizen|I... I didn't see nothin'!  He... he died of natural causes.}}
:{{text|say|Stormwind Investigator|Natural causes?  Two bullets in the chest and his shoes are on his head.  What kind of natural death would that be?}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|Doesn't look good, rookie.}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|This was an execution.  Whoever did this was sending a message...}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|A message for anyone that would dare snitch on these criminals.}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|It would appear that poor Lou really did put his foot...}}
:''Laine slips on his sunglasses as he speaks.''
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|In his mouth.}}
