== Objectives ==
Recover the Gnoll Attack Orders.
*[[Gnoll Attack Orders]]

== Description ==
After my tour of duty was over in [[Grizzly Hills]], I returned to [[Westfall]], only to find the land in worse condition than when I left.

The price of our war left thousands of citizens homeless. They now migrate here and squat upon the deserted farmhouses and towns of the region.

To make matters worse, we are now under attack by [[gnoll]]s. The [[Westfall Brigade]] needs your help, <name>. Slay the attacking gnolls and recover their orders. Someone is pulling their strings and we need to find out whom!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sentinel Hill Breastplate
|Sentinel Hill Vest
|Sentinel Hill Surcoat
|Sentinel Hill Hauberk
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
Have you recovered the attack orders?

== Completion ==
Helix? I've heard that name before. Recently as a matter of fact, but who is this admiral?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[The Westfall Brigade]] before heading out. Valid targets are {{NPC||Riverpaw Brute}}s, {{NPC||Riverpaw Herbalist}}s and {{NPC||Riverpaw Bandit}}s.

On complete:
:''Stoutmantle walks over to Ripsnarl and stands in front of the stocks.''
:{{text|say|Marshal Gyran Stoutmantle|Do you know anything about this, beast? Who is the admiral? Speak!}}
:{{text|say|Ripsnarl|The dawning comes, Stoutmantle, and with it comes your end.}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Gyran Stoutmantle|Gibberish from a mad wolf. Bah!}}
:''Stoutmantle returns to his spot.''
