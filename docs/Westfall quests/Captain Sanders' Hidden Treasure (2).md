==Objectives==
Find the old barrel near the ruined chimney and search it for your next clue.
*[[A Clue to Sanders' Treasure]] (provided)

==Description==
The clue to the treasure reads: Good work, matey!  Now ye need to head due east.  East up the bluffs, east to the road.  Look for the ol' chimney ruins near the side of the road.  There you'll find an old barrel with your next clue.

==Progress==
This looks like the right barrel. 

==Completion==
Good work, treasure hunter! 

==Notes==
Head east up the bluff. Keep heading east until reaching the main north-south road headed north [[Moonbrook]] up to the [[Molsen Farm]]. However, the is interrupted by the [[Raging Chasm]]. At the edge of the chasm is a barrel that looks a little suspicious, likely guarded by an [[Energized Harvest Reaper]].
