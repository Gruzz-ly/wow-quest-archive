'''Furlbrow's Deed''' is a [[breadcrumb quest]] that begins with the [[Westfall Deed (object)|Westfall Deed]] found at [[Hogger Hill]] in [[Elwynn Forest]].

==Objectives==
Bring Furlbrow's Deed to the [[Jansen Stead]] in [[Westfall]]. 
*[[Furlbrow's Deed]] (provided)

==Description==
This is an old deed to an expanse of farmlands within [[Westfall]]. It is signed by a [[Farmer Furlbrow|Theodore Furlbrow]] and cosigned by his wife, [[Verna Furlbrow|Verna]]. And on the back of the deed are hastily scrawled words:

"[[Defias Brotherhood|We]] leaned on Furlbrow and got his deed. Thought it might be handy if you wanted to forge one of these for your own place.

The Furlbrows won't give us trouble. Last I saw them they were on their way out of Westfall, stuck with a broken wagon."

You think the Furlbrows might want their deed back... 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*630 [[XP]]
*+250 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
We don't need any civilian vigilante types getting involved, kid. Leave this one to the professionals.

==Completion==
This is useless. Look at the date on this letter. The Furlbrows have been squatting on the Jansen Stead for five years.

They never could quite get their wagon... fixed.

==Progression==
{{Westfall storyline}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Updated. See [[Furlbrow's Deed (Classic)]] for the original version.}}
