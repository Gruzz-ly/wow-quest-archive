== Objectives ==
Use the Harvest Watcher Heart on an Overloaded Harvest Golem and then use the Overloaded Harvest Golem to kill 25 Energized Harvest Reapers.
*{{NPC||Overloaded Harvest Golem}} enabled
*[[Energized Harvest Reaper]] slain (25)
*[[Harvest Watcher Heart (quest item)]] (provided)

== Description ==
From what I've heard, all you really need to do is find a suitable harvest golem and drop in the heart.  Once you've done that you should be able to take full control of the creature.

I think that there's a whole field of overloaded harvest golems west of here, at the [[Molsen Farm]].  Look for the arcs of electricty.

Should you manage to get it working, use the golem to destroy the energized harvest reapers at the old Molsen farm.  Those monsters are much more destructive than the ones on our farm.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Saldean's Working Gloves
|Chewed Belt
|Harvester Boots
|Chewed Chain Cord
}}

You will also receive:
* 740 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
Did you find the golems?

== Completion ==
It actually worked?  That's incredible, <name>.  Hopefully that takes care of the harvest golem problem here in Westfall.

== Notes ==
[[File:It's Alive.jpg|thumb|250px|A player-controlled Overloaded Harvest Golem]]
Head due west toward [[Molsen Farm]]. Overloaded Harvest Golems are dead harvest watchers arcing electricity. Use the item to hop in the golem, which has two abilities:
#{{abilities|Reaping Blows|range=Melee|Chops, dices and minces your enemy in 5 sec.|note=Channeled.}}
#{{abilities|Rocket Boost|Fires the booster rockets on the Overloaded Harvest Golem, increasing its speed by 100% for 5 sec and running over anything that gets in its path.|note=Instant|cd=8 sec}}

Keep heading west to the field proper, which is filled with energized reapers. The easiest way to clear the field is to charge around in a circle to kill the harvest watchers, using the reaping blows channel to finish off stragglers.
