== Objectives ==
Slay any 12 [[Riverpaw pack|Riverpaw Gnolls]] attacking [[Sentinel Hill]].
*Attacking Riverpaw Gnoll slain x12

== Description ==
We were once known as the [[People's Militia]].  These days, though, we fight under the banner of [[Stormwind]], with the full support of {{NPC||Varian Wrynn||King Varian Wrynn}}.  Our goals here in Westfall are many: to clean up the mess left behind by the [[Defias Brotherhood|Defias]], to expand the reach of the [[Alliance]] and to maintain order.  So far we are failing on all fronts.

Times are worse now than when the Defias ran amok.  Now with the indigenous [[gnoll]]s of the region up in arms, we find ourselves backed into a corner.  Help us, <name>!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

== Progress ==
Defend Sentinel Hill!

== Completion ==
Well done, <name>. You have provided us a temporary reprieve from the onslaught of gnolls, but there is more work to be done.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[In Defense of Westfall]] before heading out. Valid targets are {{NPC||Riverpaw Brute}}s, {{NPC||Riverpaw Herbalist}}s and {{NPC||Riverpaw Bandit}}s.

==Progression==
