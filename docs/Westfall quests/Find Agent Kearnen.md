== Objectives ==
Find {{NPC||Amber Kearnen||Agent Kearnen}}.

== Description ==
[[SI:7|SI: 7]] has been tracking {{NPC||Helix Gearbreaker}} since he entered [[Alliance]] territory two weeks ago.  The letter I received from {{NPC||Mathias Shaw}} explained that he sent an agent by the name of Kearnen to [[Westfall]] to shadow Helix.  Find Agent Kearnen and you'll find Helix Gearbreaker.

Kearnen came [[Sentinel Hill|into town]] for supplies two days ago.  She mentioned that she would be near [[Mortwake's Tower]], southeast of here, on the [[Dust Plains]].

Get going, <name>.

== Completion ==
Helix is the one responsible for the gnoll attacks?

<Kearnen nods at the tower.>

He's inside. He's been there for days. I've just been waiting for an excuse to bust him.

== Notes ==
Head south out of Sentinel Hill and take a left at the fork on the road to Duskwood, then turn south before crossing the river. Kearnen is sitting on a fallen tree aiming a sniper rifle at the tower.
