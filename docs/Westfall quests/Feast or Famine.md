== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Coyote Tails and 5 handfuls of Fresh Dirt.
*[[Coyote Tail]] x6
*[[Fresh Dirt]] x5

== Description ==
Life in [[Westfall]]'s hard, <sonny/missy>! Every day is a struggle. We can sometimes go weeks without a decent meal. That's why it's important that we all help each other out. Maybe you can lend a hand, eh? I'm making dirt piles and need some ingreients.

Get me some fresh dirt from the pumpkin patch out front and a bunch of coyote tails. You'll find [[coyote]]s wandering around in the wilds of Westfall.

Get moving! We got mouths to feed!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*910 [[XP]]
*[[Westfall Mud Pie]]

== Progress ==
Pies don't make themselves - usually.

== Completion ==
Just smellin' you comin' got my stomach rumblin'!  We're gonna eat like kings tonight!

== Notes ==
If by the wilds she means just outside on the farm, then sure.
