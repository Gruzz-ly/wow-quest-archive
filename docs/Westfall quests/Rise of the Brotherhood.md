==Objectives==
Bear witness to the rise of the [[Defias Brotherhood|Brotherhood]].
*Rise of the Brotherhood witnessed
*Report to Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth at Stormwind Keep in Stormwind.

==Description==
I had no idea that {{NPC||Edwin VanCleef||VanCleef}} had {{NPC||Vanessa VanCleef||a daughter}}, <name>. If there was one thing that man was exceptionally skilled at, it was keeping secrets.

How tragic. Poor thing witnessed a horrible act. Had I only known.

What was that? Did you hear something? It seems as if the gnolls are pulling back... where are my guards?

ON GUARD, <name>!

*+500 reputation with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

==Progress==
What news do you bring from Westfall?

On accept, Sentinel Hill and Sentinel Tower will be phased.
:{{text|say|Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle|I don't like this, <name>.  Stay alert!}}
:''Hope walks out from the tower to Gryan, who turns to her.''
:{{text|say|Hope Saldean|You bastards will burn for what you did.}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle|Hope!  Wha..}}
:{{text|say|Hope Saldean|Hope?  Is that what I was supposed to feel when I saw my father [[The Defias Brotherhood (7)|decapitated by your henchmen]]?}}
:{{text|say|Hope Saldean|Hope is a cruel joke, played upon us by a harsh and uncaring world.  There is no Hope, there is only Vanessa.  Vanessa VanCleef.}}
:''Hope sheds her disguise, revealing herself as Vanessa VanCleef!''
:{{text|yell|Vanessa VanCleef|RISE UP BROTHERHOOD!  THE DAWNING DAY IS UPON US!}}
:''A large number of [[Defias Blackguard (Westfall)|Defias Blackguards]] spawn around the friendlies; all the NPCs are sapped.''
:{{text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|Tie them up.}}
:''Vanessa walks up to Ripsnarl, freeing him from the stock.''
:{{text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|Admiral, your hat.}}
:''Ripsnarl switches to his human form.''
:{{text|say|Admiral Ripsnarl|Thank you, my dear.}}
:''Admiral Ripsnarl makes his way from around the stock as he puts on his admiral's hat and down the tower ramp, as Vanessa turns to the adventurer.''
:{{text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|And you, <name>, I will spare your life.  You have done much to help our cause, albeit unwittingly, but the next time we meet it will be as enemies.}}
:''Vanessa makes her way down the ramp, but stops when Laine calls out to her, turning around to answer.''
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|Just tell me one thing, Vanessa.}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|Why'd you have the Furlbrows killed?}}
:{{text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|I had no choice, lieutenant.  They recognized me.  The only people in the world who even knew I existed, recognized my face from when I was an infant.}}
:{{text|say|Vanessa VanCleef|I took no pleasure in their deaths.}}
:{{text|yell|Vanessa VanCleef|Leave nothing but ashes in your wake, brothers!  Burn Sentinel Hill to the ground!}}
:''The blackguards throw flares, setting Sentinel Tower alight.  Vanessa and her minions leave shortly thereafter.''
:{{text|say|Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle|<Name>, get to Stormwind.  Tell King Wrynn everything.  EVERYTHING!  GO NOW!}}

Conveniently, {{NPC||Thor}}, the flight master, is still in phase. Take a quick trek to Stormwind and speak to [[Jes-Tereth]], who stands next to [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]].
