==Objectives==
Bring a scale of Old Murk-Eye to [[Captain Grayson]] at the [[Westfall Lighthouse]].
*[[Scale of Old Murk-Eye]]

==Description==
When my life was ended upon the rocks, I had no clue what the afterlife held for me.  The Lighthouse was black that night because Old Murk-Eye had scared the keeper's family off.  They returned and re-lit the flame but Old Murk-Eye coerced the weaker minded murlocs to raid the Lighthouse with him once again.  The second time the family was not so lucky and before my eyes they perished helplessly.

Slay Old Murk-Eye if you see him along the shore and bring me one of his scales and I shall reward you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Grayson's Torch|Buckler of the Seas|Torchlight Wand (quest reward)}}

==Progress==
Have you laid waste to the menace known as Old Murk-Eye yet?  He has been spotted roaming the coastline of Westfall.

Return to me when the foul beast is dead. 

==Completion==
So the foul heathen, Murk-Eye is dead.  Well done, <name>.  By your hands one life was laid to rest but perhaps many more were saved.  The Great Sea, wrought with danger as it is, shall be a wee bit safer this night thanks to your heroics. 

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Coast Isn't Clear]] and [[Keeper of the Flame]] before heading out.

Murlocs are all along the longshore, so kill murlocs heading up the coast to the chasm, collect the oozes, then return down the longshore, killing murlocs along the way, past the lighthouse to the southernmost murloc camp, where Murk-Eye awaits. Kill him then head back to the lighthouse.

[[Grayson's Torch]] is your better choice for [[transmogrification]]; [[Buckler of the Seas]] can be replaced by [[Wheel of the Lost Hope]].
