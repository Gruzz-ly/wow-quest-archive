==Objectives==
Meet [[Vanessa VanCleef|Vanessa]], [[Cecilia Clessington|Cecilia]], and [[Mathias Shaw|Shaw]] in [[Northshire Valley|Northshire]].

==Description==
[[File:Defias Rebels.png|thumb|Defias Rebels.]]
Vanessa's care for [[Westfall|her people]] deserves better than a [[Defias Brotherhood|brotherhood of bandits]]. I am glad to see them part ways.

And as [[spymaster]], I'm in no small part relieved.

Now, Northshire. [[Peasant]]s can become heroes, there. Perhaps your own journey began in that [[Northshire Abbey|abbey]]?

It's also a strong, defensible position to attack [[Stormwind]] from. We cannot let it fall!

Hurry, to Northshire!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We must help!

==Notes==

:''A group of three [[Defias Rebel]]s approach.''
:{{Text|Say|Defias Rebel|Wait!}}
:{{Text|Say|Defias Rebel|Vanessa, we're with you. We didn't join the Defias to steal from innocents.}}
:{{Text|Say|Defias Rebel|If the Brotherhood wants to follow [[Duncon Ratsbon|Duncon]] down the path of banditry for banditry's sake... we don't want any part of it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|We've always walked a fine line. Thank you all. Go home to your families--this isn't your fight anymore.}}
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|We will never let Stormwind abandon and abuse Westfall again. But this is not the way to do it.}}
:{{Text|Say|Defias Rebel|Thank you, Hope.}}
:''Cecilia and Shaw rides off.''
:{{Text|Say|Vanessa VanCleef|It's been a long time since I've gone by that name.}}
:''Vanessa lingers for a moment before joining them.''

Arriving in Northshire, everything is chaos. Approach Shaw and the others
:{{Text|Say|[[Marshal McBride]]|Is that VanCleef?! Guards!}}
:{{Text|Say|Master Mathias Shaw|Hold, Marshal. She's on our side, for now.}}

Near the entrance to the valley, Shaw, Vanessa, and Marshal McBride hold off a pair of [[Clessington Attendant]]s, with Cecilia standing behind them. The flanks are held by [[Brother Sammuel]], [[Llane Beshere]], and [[Bao]]. [[Sergeant Willem]] is found kneeling next to the wounded, while [[Brother Paxton]] and [[Brother Neals]] tend to the [[Injured Recruit]]s, [[Injured Soldier (Elwynn Forest)|Injured Soldiers]], and the [[Injured Commoner]].

Cecilia has new gossip:
:I'm sorry there isn't much I can do to fight... or even to heal.

:My father is a respected [[mage]] and tried to teach me, but I was always more interested in books and making sure our family accounts were in order.

:I regret that now.

:I may not be able to cast any spells or wield a greatsword, but if any of these attackers get to me, I'll give them the best wallop I've got!
