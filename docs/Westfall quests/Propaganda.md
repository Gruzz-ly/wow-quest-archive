== Objectives ==
Recover an Informational Pamphlet, Secret Journal, an issue of the Moonbrook Times and Mysterious Propaganda.
*[[Informational Pamphlet]]
*[[Issue of the Moonbrook Times]]
*[[Secret Journal]]
*[[Mysterious Propaganda]]

== Description ==
We've noticed a rise in violent acts amongst the homeless of the area. Something or someone is getting them all riled up. Now whoever is behind all this is getting more organized. Just recently a group of thugs came through here handing out pamphlets.

Enter [[Moonbrook]] and look for evidence. Propaganda, leaflets, whatever... Bring whatever you find back to me. Maybe we can find the source through the writings.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

== Progress ==
Any luck?

== Completion ==
V? The only V I know is {{NPC||Edwin VanCleef||VanCleef}}, but he died many years ago.

== Notes ==
While killing Moonbrook Thugs, keep an eye out for the [[Red Bandana]] - it starts [[Evidence Collection]]. Immediately accept it and keep killing thugs.

Look inside the [[town hall]], upstairs in the inn and by the fountain in the town square.
