== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Thoralius the Wise}} at [[Moonbrook]] in [[Westfall]].

== Description ==
There is a [[shaman]] here, Thoralius, who might be able to aid us.  He is a friend of {{NPC||Gryan Stoutmantle||Gryan's}} who has recently come to Westfall to study the elemental devastation that has befallen us.

Speak to Thoralius and see if there is something that he can do to shed some light on the identity of this shadowy figure.

== Completion ==
Hmm, yes, perhaps I could be of some assistance.  When I was in [[Northrend]] I helped the people of [[Valgarde]] uncover [[Into the World of Spirits|some of the mysteries]] of the [[vrykul]] by [[The Echo of Ymiron|delving into the spirit world]].  Perhaps the same could be done here.
