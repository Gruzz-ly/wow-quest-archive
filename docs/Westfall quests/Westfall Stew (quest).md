==Description==
Hello, dear.  Welcome to [[Saldean's Farm|our home]].  Hmm, you don't look like you're homeless.  Have you come to help us?  If so, you're just in time!  I'm planning dinner for the young ones and need a few simple ingredients.

If you could get me some okra, goretusk flanks and stringy fleshripper meat I can make my famous [[:Westfall Stew]]!  You'll find all of the ingredients near our farm.  Just be careful of the {{NPC||Harvest Watcher||harvest watchers}}.  They are [[harvest golem|merciless killers]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Tightly Cinched Belt
|Boiled Boots
|Golden Sunshine Cloak
|Boiled Chain Footpads

You will also receive:
* 740 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Food will be ready as soon as I have all of the ingredients!  Hurry!

==Completion==
Bless your heart, dear.  These poor orphans haven't had a hot meal in days.

It looks like we will have enough left over to help feed many more of the homeless of [[Westfall]].
