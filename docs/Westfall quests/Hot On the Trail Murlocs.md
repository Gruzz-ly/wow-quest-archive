== Objectives ==
Recover the Murloc Clue.
*[[Murloc Clue]]

== Description ==
As pointless as I think that is going to be, we need to investigate all of our leads.

I need you to head out to the [[Longshore]], west of here, on the coast, and shake up some [[murloc]]s. Try to find a clue or some info that can help shed some light on the murders.

Return to me if you get lucky, rookie.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||4}} (or {{cost||5|40}} at max level)

== Progress ==
How goes the murloc hunt?

== Completion ==
Nice find, rookie. I think I have a stack of these back on my desk at the station. We're basically back to square one. What do we know? Someone that likes to write fiction about the past sent the Furlbrows a letter.

Looks like we got ourselves a real history... mystery.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Hot On the Trail: The Riverpaw Clan]] before heading out.

The murlocs stand a chance of dropping [[Captain Sanders' Treasure Map]], which starts a short treasure-hunting quest chain, beginning with [[Captain Sanders' Hidden Treasure]].

==Progression==
{{Westfall storyline}}
