== Objectives ==
Slay 5 Riverpaw Mystics, 5 Riverpaw Taskmasters and Jango Spothide.
*[[Riverpaw Mystic]] slain x5
*[[Riverpaw Taskmaster]] slain x5
*[[Jango Spothide]] slain

== Description ==
South of here is an area of [[Westfall]] known as the [[Dust Plains]]. From what we know the [[gnoll]]s of the region have made the Dust Plains their unofficial capital. As with any capital, there exists a leader at the heart. If we are to put an end to these attacks, we must track down the gnoll in charge and end him.

Venture forth into the Dust Plains, find the gnoll leader, Jango Spothide, and kill him. Take out any other gnolls that get in your way.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Dust Plains Greaves
|Spothide Leggings
|Mystic Riverpaw Wand
|Spothide Legguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 740 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Stormwind (faction)|Stormwind]]

== Progress ==
Have you found Jango?

== Completion ==
Excellent work, <name>. It will take the Riverpaw weeks to recover from the blow you just dealt. Please take an item of your choosing as a reward for what you have done.

== Notes ==
Before heading out to kill gnolls, pick up the [[Find Agent Kearnen]] chain before heading out. On the way back during [[Big Trouble in Moonbrook]], kill the gnolls required to save a trip. [[Jango Spothide]] is in the ruins of a house due west of [[Mortwake's Tower]] at {{co|62.2|76.4|Westfall}}.
