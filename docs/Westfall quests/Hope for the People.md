== Objectives ==
Take the Westfall Stew to {{NPC||Hope Saldean}} at [[Sentinel Hill]].
*[[Westfall Stew (quest item)#Hope for the People]] (provided)

== Description ==
About four years ago, in the dead of night, a little girl walked right into our farmhouse and collapsed on the floor.  Nobody had a clue as to her identity.  The poor little thing had no recollection of who she was or where she came from - truly a lost soul.

Soon after, we adopted the little girl and named her Hope - for that is what she represented.

She is now a young lady, caring for the destitute and homeless of Westfall.  Take my Westfall stew to her at [[Sentinel Hill]], south of here.

== Progress ==
Good day <sir/miss>.  How may I serve you?

== Completion ==
I smell Westfall stew! {{NPC||Salma Saldean||Mother}} sent you!?

== Notes ==
Head to the southeast to Sentinel Hill, then up the hill to [[Sentinel Tower]]. Hope is just inside the tower, but first, overhear the conversation {{NPC||Horatio Laine}} and {{NPC||Gryan Stoutmantle}} are having:
:{{text|say|Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle|You have our full cooperation, lieutenant.  The Furlbrows were good people.  Their deaths will not go unpunished.}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|That's good to hear, marshal.  While <name> has brought the perpetrators to justice, their ringleader is still on the loose.  Perhaps with the aid of the [[Westfall Brigade]] we will finally be able to solve this case.}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|Might I ask, what's with the [[worgen]] in the stocks?}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle|We caught this beast slaughtering sheep in the countryside.  He is unrepentant and easily agitated.  Keep your distance, lieutenant.}}
:''[[Ripsnarl]] struggles in the stocks as he responds.''
:{{text|say|Ripsnarl|When I break out of these stocks I'm going to rip out your heart and devour it whole!}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|Wow, the marshal wasn't kidding}}.
:''Laine walks over to Ripsnarl.''
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|But is your bark...}}
:''Laine slips on his sunglasses as he speaks.''
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Horatio Laine|Worse than your bite?}}
