==Objectives==
Search the empty jug next to the windmill for the next clue.
*[[Another Clue to Sanders' Treasure]] (provided)

==Description==
Searching through the barrel you discover another piece of parchment.  This one reads:  Now from this here barrel, face ye North.  Straight as the crow flies, keep ye walkin' till you see the empty jug next to the lone windmill on the sea bluffs.  If ye poke around that jug, ye just might find what you're lookin' for.

==Progress==
There's a clue sticking out of the empty jug. 

==Completion==
You're on your way to the jackpot, treasure seeker! 

==Notes==
Heading due north from the Broken Barrel is complicated by the fact that the [[Raging Chasm]] is in the way. So, circle around the chasm to the east and pick up the road heading north. As the road turns east to pass south of the [[Jangolode Mine]], keep heading north to find a windmill on the bluff overlooking the sea. The old jug is a few yards away from it to the east.
