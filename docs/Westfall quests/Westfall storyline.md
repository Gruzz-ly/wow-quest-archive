{{for|the pre-Cataclysm storyline|Westfall quests}}

'''Westfall''' is an Alliance-only level 10-15 zone in western [[Azeroth (continent)|Azeroth]] of the [[Eastern Kingdoms]]. Players are led here from [[Elwynn Forest]] and are immediately thrust into a murder mystery case. The storyline takes players around the broken zone and into the [[Deadmines]] before returning to [[Sentinel Hill]] for the climax.

The progress of the storyline is tracked in the achievement [[Westfall Quests]].

After Threat to the Kingdom, or as soon as players reach level 14, players are sent to [[Three Corners]] in [[Redridge Mountains]] to start the [[Redridge Mountains storyline]] with [[Hero's Call: Redridge Mountains! (NPC)]].
