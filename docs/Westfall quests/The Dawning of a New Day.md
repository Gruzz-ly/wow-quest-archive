I could hear the cheers from here.  It seems as if we've got a huge problem on our hands, <name>.  We have to discover the identity of this shadowy menace before we enlist the aid of [[Stormwind]].  Perhaps there is another way...

[[File:The Dawning of a New Day.jpg|thumb|250px|The Shadowy Figure stirs the masses.]]
At {{co|43.9|6.9|Westfall}} atop the hay trailer in the middle of [[Moonbrook]], the Shadowy Figure is holding a rally:
:{{text|bossemote|The rally is about to begin!}}
:{{text|yell|Shadowy Figure|Gather, brothers and sisters!  Come, all, and listen!}}
:{{text|yell|Shadowy Figure|Brothers.  Sisters.  We are ABANDONED - the orphaned children of Stormwind.}}
:{{text|yell|Shadowy Figure|Our "king" sits atop his throne made of gold and shrugs at our plight!}}
:{{text|yell|Shadowy Figure|Meanwhile, our children die of starvation on these very streets!}}
:{{text|yell|Shadowy Figure|HIS war, not ours, cost us our livelihood.  WE paid for the Alliance's victories with our blood and the blood of our loved ones!}}
:{{text|yell|Shadowy Figure|The time has come, brothers and sisters, to stop this injustice!}}
:{{text|yell|Shadowy Figure|The government of Stormwind, of the ALLIANCE, must be made accountable for what it has done to us!}}
:{{text|yell|Shadowy Figure|Today, we are reborn!  Today, we take a stand as men and women, not nameless, faceless numbers!}}
:''As the figure hoists into the air a rifle by the stock with a tattered pennant tied to the end, the crowd applauds and cheers.''
