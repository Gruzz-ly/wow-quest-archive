== Objectives ==
Recover the Riverpaw Gnoll Clue
*[[Riverpaw Gnoll Clue]]

== Description ==
Seeing as how we have no other leads, we may as well chase down the information you got.

There are a couple of [[Riverpaw]] [[gnoll]] camps in the area. Track them down and search for clues. Bring back anything that you might find. Isolate your search to the {{NPC||Riverpaw Gnoll||Riverpaw gnoll}}s and {{NPC||Riverpaw Scout||scouts}}.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}

== Progress ==
Find anything on the gnolls?

== Completion ==
Is this supposed to be some kind of joke, because I'm not laughing. Bits and pieces of red cloth? What the hell is this supposed to mean?

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Hot On the Trail: Murlocs]] before heading out.

==Progression==
{{Westfall storyline}}

==Patch changes==
