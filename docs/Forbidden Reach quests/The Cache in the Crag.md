==Objectives==
Speak to Roska to begin carefully excavating the dragonkin cache.
*Speak to Ruska to start the excavation
*Cache Excavated
*[[Archivist's Wind Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
<This barrel is salt-encrusted and buried amongst the rubble but remarkably intact.

It looks like the sort of mundane cache that villagers would use to store goods, but no one has lived here for thousands of years. Could there still be something inside?

Roska will want to have a look at this!>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost |28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Nothing like a crag, eh <name>? Never know what you'll find!

==Completion==
Wow, <name>! Not only is this cache intact, but it's full of something other than seawater!

Imagine finding great-great-great grandma's jam recipe that'd been lost for thousands of years. Yep, the locals are gonna love this!

==Notes==
On accept, Roska parachutes down to sea level:
:{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Whoa! That's quite a find!}}

Speak with her:
{{book|content={{gossip|quest=|Let's start excavating!}}}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Start drying that soggy thing out with my totem, but be careful!}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Too dry and it'll break! Use those waterspouts to wet it down again.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Only excavate when conditions are just right!}}

If the artifact is too dry:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Get some water in there before the winds break up our artifact!}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|It's getting too brittle! A little seatwater--quick!}}

If the artifact is too wet:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Dry it out before our find washes out to sea!}}

If the conditions for digging are perfect:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Perfect! Now let's get it out of there!}}

Upon examining the Intact Dragonkin Cache after excavation, you find [[Pouch of Coins]].

Upon finding the cache Roska has new gossip:
{{book|content=
{{gossip|What can you tell me about this incredible find?}}

This cache must have been stored in a cellar somewhere thousands of years, only coming to the surface when the bridge collapsed.

Sure, it's not as flashy as some of the other stuff we dig up, but mundane finds are exciting for other reasons. We'll get to see what they thought was important enough to store and maybe figure out how they made their food or wine.

This here is a glimpse into the lives of ordinary folks!

But first, we've got to get it out of all this rubble.
