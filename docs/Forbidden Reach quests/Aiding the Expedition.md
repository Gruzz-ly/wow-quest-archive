==Objectives==
Meet [[Scalecommander Emberthal]] and [[Ebyssian]] at [[Stormsunder Crater]] in the [[Forbidden Reach]].

==Description==
[[Sarkareth]] must pay for his crimes.

<Emberthal steels herself.>

We cannot let any more dracthyr suffer because of Sarkareth's twisted ambitions. 

If the Sundered Flame is threatening the [[Dragonscale Expedition]], then our allies need our help.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +25 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +25 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Completion==
Too many have suffered. Too many have died.

Enough is enough. Sarkareth is responsible, and he must pay.
