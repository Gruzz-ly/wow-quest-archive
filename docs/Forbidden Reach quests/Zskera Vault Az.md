==Description==
[[File:Terrorachna.jpg|thumb|[[Terrorachna]]]]
We have discovered a series of vaults below [[Morqut Islet|the island]]. [[Neltharion]] hoarded treasures, accumulated knickknacks, and stashed away the results of his failed experiments.

When I say he's a hoarder, I'm not kidding! He filled chamber after chamber, and in time, they were all forgotten... until now. Treasure awaits us behind these locked doors! Also, the occasional deathtrap. Also, treasure! Now we have [[Zskera Vault Key|the keys]] to unlock those doors.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==

Have you explored the vault?

==Completion==
Well done. As long as we keep finding keys, we can keep exploring. In a few days, I'm sure we'll explore another vault.

I think the names of these vaults are numbered. Az, [[The Scary Vault of Ur|Ur]], [[Zskera Vault: Ix|Ix]], [[Zskera Vault: Kx|Kx]]... those words must mean something. Don't get me wrong, I'm focused on the treasure, but I wouldn't mind learning a thing or two along the way... or is it "a thing or Ix"? Maybe it is.

==Notes==
Before going in, pick up [[The Keys You Need]] from [[Pathfinder Tacha]], [[One Dragon's Junk...]] from [[Voraxian]], and [[Authentic Authorization]] from [[Cataloger Wulferd]].

Then speak with Jeb again:
:The island has many secrets beneath the surface I aim to discover them all.
:{{gossip|How can I find more Zskera Vault Keys?}}
:Someone made off with a bunch of our keys! We're going to need them back if we're going to explore the vaults.
:Take a quick look around the Forbidden Reach. See if you can find anyone or anything that's taken the keys. It might take some force to get them back.
:{{gossip|quest=|Let's explore Zskera Vault Az.}}
:''The player enters Zskera Vault: Az.''

On the other side of the loading screen:
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|I think we're the first to visit these vaults in a long while.}}
:''Jeb and Tacha run downstairs.''

Jeb has gossip:
:<Pathfinder Jeb is closely studying a half-drawn map.>
:The scouts did a good job mapping out this area before our arrival.
:Lots of detail, although I'm not certain how to interpret this sad monkey face yet...
:That very ominous skull up in the mountainside, on the other hand? I can guess what that means.

As does Tacha:
:I hope you came prepared. I expect many dangers here.
:{{gossip|Tell me more about Zskera Vault Keys.}}
:We need vault keys to open the doors inside Zskera Vaults. Then we can get to the treasures inside!
:You should search the Forbidden Reach. See if you can find more keys. The more keys we have, the more treasure we can get!

Head further downstairs:
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Tacha|We have your back <name>.}}

[[File:Reagent Pot.jpg|thumb|The [[Reagent Pot]].]]
Jeb and Tacha serve as bodyguards. Clear out the [[Vault Weaver]] guarding the entry to the big chamber, then the elite spider [[Terrorachna]] in the center of the room. Once clear, counterclockwise from the south is a [[Reagent Pot]] which contains some [[Awakened Air]], the [[Odd Device]] for [[One Dragon's Junk...]] is on a crate in the southwest, an an [[Unusual Ring]] is on the ground in the southeast. It starts [[The Forgotten Ring]].

After using the web rope to get upstairs and opening one (but only one!) of the locked doors, turn in to Jeb to stop Terrorachna from respawning. Then head back to the surface to pick up [[What's Behind The Next Door]], which requires players to open three additional doors.

After opening the first vault door:
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Tacha|Yes! Lost fortunes revealed, we need to open more doors!}}

Upon approaching Jeb after opening the first vault door
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|Keep searching, see what you can find in some of these rooms.}}
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|This vault is just the start! Imagine what the others may contain.}}
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|It will take days to catalog everything in this vault!}}

[[File:Zskera Vault Az - Yevaa and Ortez.jpg|thumb|[[Earthcaller Yevaa]] and [[Immutable Ortez]]]]
On the third level (use the Positional Displacer to reach it!), [[Earthcaller Yevaa]] and [[Immutable Ortez]] have smashed down a vault door. Yevaa offers [[Primordial Answers]]. She also has gossip:
:Never doubt the bond of the earth.
:It is steadfast and supports us in all our actions.
:{{gossip|How did you get here?}}
:One can achieve incredible things with the aid of the elements. 
:In other words, Oretz smashed the doors down!

===Utility lootables===
The rooms are randomized per-player per-week, so here are some generic suggestions:

Open one of the doors accessed via the web ropes to find the [[Flask of Windward Steps]], which allows jumping between platforms via an Extra Action Button. Other useful finds include the [[Energized Circlet]], which provides a player-centered light source, the Reflective Arcane Ward and Protective Ward of Flames, which reflect their respective elements, and the [[Positional Displacer]], granting a throwable teleport target, which can be used to reach the third and fourth levels of vaults.
