==Objectives==
Slay 4 Sundered Pillagers, 6 Sundered Ruinstalkers, and Winglord Iyazael in the [[High Creche]].

* [[Winglord Iyazael]] slain {{co|56.2|68.5|Forbidden Reach}}
*Speak to Scalecommander Emberthal in the High Creche

==Description==
[[File:Winglord Iyazael.jpg|thumb|upright|Winglord Iyazael]]

It's not enough that Sarkareth kills our people, twists our heritage, and burns everything in his path. Now he seeks to pillage the creche of the Adamantine Vigil. 

<Emberthal snarls.>

Ebyssian and I will stay here while you push back the Sundered Flame. We'll meet you up top once the Expedition is secure.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 350x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +250 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +250 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Don't tell me you need to catch your breath.

==Completion==
There is no victory to celebrate this day. Every dead dracthyr is a tragedy that could have been... should have been avoided.

Our hands run red with blood from our failures.

==Notes==
Before leaving, Ebyssian has gossip:
:The Sundered Flame are attacking our people across the Reach. 
:Their aggression is limitless. Their hubris knows no bounds... but to what end?

As does Emberthal:
:I will not let Sarkareth shed more innocent blood.

Generic pillagers and ruinstalkers are all over the [[Talonlords' Perch]] and [[Winglord Iyazael]] is in the western [[High Creche]] building.

Behind Iyazael on the back wall is [[Edict: The Adamant Vigil]].

Find Emberthal and Ebyssian in the eastern High Creche building:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|This place, Ebyssian. It feels... familiar.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I sense a great power within it.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Who is this?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|This is an ancient work of magic. I sense Neltharion's handiwork. This construct should have run out of essence long ago.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|The collectors... they are saturated with black dragon essence, far more than what you would detect in any one dragon. It's almost as if...}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|The symbols are conduits of power. If I understand correctly, it is drawing that power from the creches... from the dracthyr themselves.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Neltharion was drawing the essence of the black dragonflight from dracthyr in stasis. This... siphon must have been empowering his dark enchantment while denying that power to the dracthyr.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Whoever this dragon is, she has been trapped in torment for a very long time. We should learn more before attempting to destroy her oubliette.}}

At the High Creche, Ebyssian has new gossip:
:The contents of this room mean more to my flight than you know, <name>.
:Neltharion used the dracthyr as... fuel. He fed off of them, siphoning their essence into this prison. What other machinations did he have? What does this say about the origin of our allies? 
:I worry for them.
:<Ebyssian lets out a heavy sigh.>
:I worry for us all.
