[[File:Stuck Tuskarr Kite.jpg|thumb|Stuck Tuskarr Kite]]

==Objectives==
Collect 12 kite pieces.
*[[Broken Kite Piece|Kite pieces]] collected (12)

==Description==
[[File:Up to the Highest Height.jpg|thumb|Broken Kite Pieces]]
[[Tuskarr]] children sure do love kites! I've seen some of them running around with them outside [[Morqut Village]]. I've also seen a lot of those kites stuck in trees.

Can you do me a favor? Could you lasso some of those kites and pull them down? They'll probably fall down in pieces, but the children can always put their kites back together. Who knows? Maybe it will teach them to be more careful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 450x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Do you have any kite pieces yet?

I'm glad those kids have something to do. If they didn't, one of them would follow me around all day, and I hate it when they do that.

==Completion==
Fantastic work! Fixing kites should keep the children busy and out of trouble... for a little while, at least.

That's a good thing. Those kids get everywhere.

==Notes==
Find kite pieces on the ridge above [[Morqut Village]] to the west, near where [[Scalecommander Emberthal]] and [[Ebyssian]] are.

==Progression==
{{Morqut Village weeklies}}
