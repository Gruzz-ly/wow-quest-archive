==Objectives==
Collect driftwood in [[Tukkaraq]]'s boat.
* Board [[Tukkaraq's Boat]] {{co|36.5|57.6|Forbidden Reach}}
* Driftwood Netted (24)

==Description==
One of the challenges of any new village is finding enough raw building materials. Fortunately, the ocean often brings us exactly what we need.

Take my boat and sail around the island. Along the way, you can collect driftwood in nets. But be wary. You may attract some unwanted attention!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 350x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
How goes the hunt for driftwood?

==Completion==
Excellent work! This will help us build new homes, tools, and everything we need for a life here.

We'll put it all to good use.

==Notes==
Hop in the boat, which grants three abilities:
# {{abilities|Toss Net|range=80|Toss a net at clumps of driftwood.|cd=3 sec|id=399933|image=|notes=0.5 sec cast. Ground-targeted AoE. Only works on driftwood}}
# {{abilities|Water Shield|Shield yourself with water, reducing damage taken and healing yourself.|cd=12 sec|id=399942|image=}}
# {{abilities|Throw Fish|Throw fish at your enemies to stun them.|range=40|cd=2 sec|id=399941|image=|notes=Instant. Works on Farscale Ambushers}}

Use the Toss Net ability on driftwood that's either free-floating or has washed up on shore. [[Farscale Ambusher]]s swim up behind the boat, so use Throw Fish to knock them away.
