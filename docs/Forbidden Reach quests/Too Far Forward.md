[[File:Too Far Forward.jpg|thumb|An injured Dark Talon and two Sundered Flame dracthyr]]

==Objectives==
Slay [[Sundered Flame]] and heal injured [[Dark Talons]] and [[Obsidian Warders]].
* Injured Dracthyr healed (8) {{co|58|66|Forbidden Reach}}
* Sundered Flame slain (10)
* [[Healing Draught]] (provided)

==Description==
Our forward forces pressed too aggressively into a Sundered Flame stronghold. Now they need help. We really need to send you in to extract them.

Help them get out of there. You can use your own magic or these healing draughts from [[Scalecommander Viridia|Viridia]]. And while you're there? Put some hurt on the Sundered Flame. They certainly deserve it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 350x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +500 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +500 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Have you rescued our soldiers?

==Completion==
It's good to see our forces returned safely, even if their pride is a little wounded. We need every soldier we have for what's to come.

==Notes==
At the [[Talonlords' Perch]], injured [[Dark Talon]]s and [[Obsidian Warder]]s are spread out all over the area. Heal them with player spells or the provided [[Healing Draught]]. Kill [[Sundered Despoiler]]s while searching for the injured dracthyr.

==Progression==
