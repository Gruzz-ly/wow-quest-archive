'''The Forgotten Ring''' starts from the [[Unusual Ring]] object on the floor of [[Zskera Vault: Az]]

==Objectives==
Deliver the ring to [[Researcher Imareth]] at [[Morqut Village]].

==Description==
<The ring bears unusual markings. It might be of interest to one of the [[dracthyr]] at Morqut Village.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Onyx Annulet]]
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh! I have not seen a relic like this since before our awakening! It is a special ring, clearly crafted by Neltharion's smiths.

You should keep it. Keep it close. It might be of use to you.

==Notes==
Imareth has gossip regarding the Annulet:
:I could spend a lifetime researching the discoveries from the Zskera Vault.
:{{gossip|Tell me about the Onyx Annulet.}}
:Designed by Neltharion himself, the Onyx Annulet was intended to empower his most elite and loyal scalecommanders... yet none were found worthy, and thus, the rings were left in the depths of his vaults.
:He designed the ring with three sockets to allow for maximum customization. You can insert different primordial gems into its sockets to help overcome any problem you might face.
:Perhaps it is best that his followers were not offered this gift. Though the annulet presents myriad permutations of empowerment, accepting one would have meant further submission to his control. Hopefully, that is no longer the case.
