What have you found?

==Completion==
;Alliance
:Well... this stone was unexpected.
:It would seem this Adamanthia was not beyond reason.
;Horde
:Well, good to see a black dragon standing up for us, even if it was too little too late.
:I wonder what this "Aberrus" is. If it is another place where dracthyr were held then we may need to find it.
:I will add this to the translated logs. I recommend taking a look as you find more of these.
