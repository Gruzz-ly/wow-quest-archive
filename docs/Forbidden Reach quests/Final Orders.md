==Objectives==
Organize the evacuation of [[Forbidden Reach]].
*Reach the [[Old Weyrn Grounds]]
*Speak with [[Nozdormu]]
*[[Scalecommander Sarkareth|Sarkareth]] spoken to
*[[Scalecommander Viridia|Viridia]] spoken to
*Report to your Scalecommander.

==Description==
The storm unleashed by [[Raszageth]] is too powerful. We must evacuate the only home we have ever known.

There is no longer an [[Deathwing|Earth-Warder]] to command us. For the first time, we are free to make our own choices. To find our own fate.

Wherever you go in this new age, I hope you find worthy allies. Tell them our story.

As for me, I will stay here and look for survivors. Along the way, I may find answers about our past.

May fortune favor us all, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*7,900 [[XP]]
*[[Dragonkin Signet Ring]]
*The "Wrath of the Storm-Eater" of [[Dracthyr, Awaken]]

==Progress==
<!-- Azurathel: -->
We are leaving! I never thought it would be like this but we will return again with greater preparation.

==Completion==
===Alliance===
[[Wrathion]] speaks of a group called the [[Alliance]]. Noble folk who care for one another and defend [[Azeroth|this world]].

He has offered to introduce us to their leaders in a place called [[Stormwind]]. Come, <name>.

===Horde===
[[Ebyssian]] tells me of a group called the [[Horde]]. Claims they value honor and strength. If true, they may prove worthy of us.

He says [[Horde Council|their council]] rules from a city called [[Orgrimmar]]. Looks like we have a long flight ahead of us!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Get our people out of here, <name>. I will stay behind and search for survivors... and answers.}}
:''Scalecommander Emberthal turns and runs back. The rest of the group runs toward the Old Weyrn Grounds.''
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Nozdormu! Behold, the Bronze Aspect has come!}}
:{{Text|yell|Nozdormu|Children of [[Neltharion]], harken to me! Your time does not end today.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|I refuse to bow to another Aspect!}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|All weyrns, prepare to evacuate! The Aspect will provide cover.}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|Come, evoker. I would speak with you.}}

;Approaching Nozdormu
:A cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|6ILew-VkqbU}}
:''Raszageth approaches Nozdormu.''
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|Raszageth!}}
:{{Text|say|Raszageth|Ah, Nozdormu. I am pleased that not all the [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]] have met a bitter end. Not yet.}}
:{{Text|say|Raszageth|Tell [[Alexstrasza|your queen]] I am coming for her. The storm's reckoning comes for you all!}}
:''Raszageth flies away.''
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|The release of Raszageth heralds great danger for this world. Just as your awakening heralds great change.}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|The [[kingdom]]s of Azeroth must be warned. Go to them. Along the way, you may discover a new destiny of your own.}}

On the other end of the cutscene:
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|Wrathion. Ebyssian. You are known to the peoples of this world. Guide the [[dracthyr]] on their journey.}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|Yes, Timeless One.}}

;Speaking with Viridia
:I know what the Aspect asks of us, but the [[Healing Wings]] cannot join you.

:We still have wounded, and these wingless drakonid have grown attached to us. No, my weyrn is not flying anywhere.

:I plan for us to cross the channel to the [[Dragon Isles]]. Plenty of others in need of our aid there, I suspect.

:Thank you for helping my people, evoker.

:No, make that <name>. Thank you, <name>.

:{{Gossip|<Salute Scalecommander Viridia.>}}
:{{Text|say|[[Scalecommander Cindrethresh]]|Viridia, you could come with us. With... me.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|I am sorry, dear friend. My weyrn will remain in the Dragon Isles. If fate is kind, we will not be parted long.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|Fair skies and strong winds, Cindre.}}

;Speaking with Sarkareth
:It was our destiny to be the finest soldiers of dragonkind. We pledged our lives to fight at Neltharion's side.

:Our LIVES, evoker. And what was our vow worth to the Aspects?

:Nothing. They locked us away like broken playthings.

:Well, we are NOT broken.

:{{Gossip|<Relay what Nozdormu told you.>}}
:{{Text|say|[[Scalecommander Azurathel]]|Sarkareth, my weyrn will follow Wrathion to the city called Stormwind. Come with us.}}
:''Sarkareth walks away. He and his [[Ebon Scale]]s then take to the skies and fly eastwards.''
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|I am done taking orders! Our vow to serve the dragons is sundered... just as Neltharion broke his promises to us!}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Let the [[Ebon Scales]] be forgotten! We are now the Sundered Flame! We will claim the destiny that is ours by right!}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|His anger pushes him down a dark path. I dread the day we meet again. Not as friends, but as rivals on the field of battle.}}

===Upon completion===
Another cutscene starts:
{{#ev:youtube|2uwbnO0xP9U}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|[[Dark Talons]], fall in!}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|We have to leave the Reach.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Lead the way, Ebyssian.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|[[Obsidian Warders|The Warders]] will follow Wrathion.}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|Children of Neltharion.}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|You have awakened to face a shattered past... and an uncertain future.}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|Yet the threads of fate weave a new path to distant shores.}}
:''Nozdormu empowers the dracthyr.''
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|The [[:Sands of Time]] will speed your wings along the way.}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|Tell the world of what you have witnessed.}}
:{{Text|say|Nozdormu|And warn them of the storm to come.}}

;Alliance
:Another cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|1_TPkaYba5w}}
:''The dracthyr appear in [[Elwynn Forest]].''
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Behold, Stormwind!}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Capital of [[Stormwind (kingdom)|the human kingdom]] and crown jewel of the Alliance.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Ruled by a [[Anduin Wrynn|dear, dear friend]] who is...}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|...sadly absent.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|Impressive walls.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|This city could withstand attack by a formidable adversary.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|Perhaps even a dragon.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|[[Deathwing#The Shattering|You have no idea]].}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Now then, to make a proper entrance, pardon me while I assume a more recognizable form.}}
:''Wrathion transforms into his human form.''
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|Ah, yes. The Earth-Warder too had a visage.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|So these... [[human]]s know you?}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Indeed! I have no doubt they will welcome me with open...}}
:''A group of [[Stormwind Guard (NPC)|Stormwind Guards]] and [[Stormwind Gryphon Rider]]s blocks their entrance.''
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|...arms.}}

;Horde
:Another cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|fkAjLSVuFYg|urlArgs=end=58}}
:''The dracthyr appear in [[Durotar]].''
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|Orgrimmar.}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|Within these walls gather the noble races of the Horde.}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|A city built upon a foundation of strength and honor.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Traits my people embody as well.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Impressive structure.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|But nothing that would hold back the might of the Dark Talons.}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|I have no doubt your soldiers will be given many chances to prove themselves.}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|Before we enter, I will assume another form.}}
:''Ebyssian transforms into his Highmountain tauren visage.''
:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|One that is more recognizable to the Horde.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|A visage. Yes, I remember the Earth-Warder had one too.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Well, we have arrived. Where are your allies, Ebyssian?}}
:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|Patience, Cindrethresh.}}
:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|I am sure we will receive an appropriate...}}
:''Several [[Orgrimmar Grunt]]s and [[Darkspear Headhunter]]s run toward you.''
:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|...welcome.}}

Durotar is now your home.
