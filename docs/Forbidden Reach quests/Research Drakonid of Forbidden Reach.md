'''Research: Drakonid of Forbidden Reach''' is an [[Azerothian Archives]] world quest that is unlocked upon completion of [[Finally, An Archivist!]]. It takes place at {{co|17.15|16.27|Forbidden Reach}} at [[Winglord's Perch]] in the [[Forbidden Reach]].

==Objectives==
* Speak with [[Bujji]] {{co|17.15|16.27|Forbidden Reach}}
* Information Collected (0/100%)

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[Nirobin]]|This tiny island is a hotbed of history! Escort my familiar around the premises so I may extract every morsel of knowledge buried here.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* {{cost|640}}
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Good enough for now, assistant! I require time to study these findings before we return.}}

==Notes==
Interact with [[Bujji]] at the west end of the marked quest area on the broken bridge, and it releases Clue Seekers all over. Go to each blue spot and use the Gain Clue extra action button to fill the bar. Also be on the look out for [[Juicy Clue]]s.

Completing this world quest adds a page to the [[Tome of Archived Isles Research]] at {{co|58.5|36.7|Thaldraszus}} in [[Nirobin]]'s office at [[Algeth'ar Academy]] in [[Thaldraszus]]:

{{book|content=Information acquired from Winglord's Perch, Forbidden Reach, Dragon Isles, Azeroth:

I've rebuilt a fragment of a letter from a child living on Winglord's Perch. It conveys loneliness, pleading the recipient to return.}}

After completing the world quest a second time, the page is filled in with more information:

{{book|content= ﻿Through this child's other writings, I've learned that all able-bodied drakonid living nearby were drafted into a conflict on the mainland. Even the youth were not spared.}}

After completing the world quest a third time, the page is completed:

{{book|content= My analysis shows this child to be the only one remaining on Winglord's Perch at the time. Apparently, she was well-hidden by the frail elderly and missed by those who claimed the other children for their armies.

I cannot help but envision the child remaining on the island long after her elderly neighbors passed, standing alone amongst the fishing poles.
