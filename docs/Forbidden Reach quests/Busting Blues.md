==Objectives==
Collect Arcane Foci from Blue Security forces in the [[Old Weyrn Grounds|Old Weyrn grounds]].
* [[Arcane Focus (item)]] (10)

==Description==
[[Malygos]] left behind forces to monitor us while we slept. He's gone, but his minions are still here, making life difficult for everyone.

Scouts have seen them using Arcane Foci. I think we could make better use of them. Go collect some. Their security forces might put up a fight, but that won't be a problem for you, will it?

<[[Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Cinderthresh]] snorts.>

Maybe they'll take the hint and leave.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 350x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you collected those foci?

==Completion==
That's a relief. Thank you. Now we can all sleep a little better at night.

==Notes==
Kill [[Arcane Revenant]]s, [[Spellsworn Construct]]s, [[Spellsworn Crechebound]], and [[Weyrn Spellslinger]]s for their [[Arcane Focus (item)]].

==Progression==
