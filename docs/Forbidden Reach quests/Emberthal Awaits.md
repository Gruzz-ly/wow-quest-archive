[[File:Emberthal Awaits.jpg|thumb|[[Scalecommander Emberthal]] and [[Ebyssian]] above [[Morqut Village]]]]

==Objectives==
Meet with [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] above the cliffs of [[Morqut Village]].
*Meet with Scalecommander Emberthal above Morqut Village

==Description==
We are by no means ready to relax, but at least our encampment here is stable... for the time being. I should be able to handle the rest of our operation from here.

Emberthal arrived while you were in the field. She and her allies are surveying the area from the cliffs above. It would be wise to check in with her, I think. We would not want her to attempt taking the Reach alone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Untapped Forbidden Knowledge]]
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +150 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +150 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Completion==
This was our training ground... and for many, it became our resting place.

So many secrets remain here. So many questions. With luck, we will find answers.

==Notes==
On approach to Emberthal and Ebyssian:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Are you certain of this course? The Reach is dangerous, and there are others who would oppose you.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|This isle is the closest thing we dracthyr have to a home. Raszageth is gone. It is time to claim what is ours!}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|You speak as though you are going into battle, Emberthal. If you assume a war footing, there will be war.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Spoken like one who spent millennia cowering in a cave.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|We have all been through trials. We have all suffered.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Indeed. Some more than others.}}

Ebyssian has gossip:
:It is good to see you, <name>. 
:The dracthyr will require all the help we can muster if they are to weather the storm ahead.

As does Emberthal after starting the next quest:
:Storm clouds still loom overhead, but each day in the Reach we see more sunlight. I hear birdsong when I awaken, and more flowers are blooming--even on the battlefield.
:It's not all doom and gloom here. The land is beginning to heal, and so are we.
