==Objectives==
Speak with [[Scalecommander Emberthal]] at the [[High Creche]].

==Description==
Evoker! You might have felt a disturbance just recently. [[Ebyssian]] and I have begun to unbind the ancient siphons that were extracting the [[black dragonflight]] essence from [[dracthyr]]. I suspect that only the fully trained evokers like yourself are tuned enough to feel the change. There is more, though. Please, come join Ebyssian and myself at the High Creche in the [[Forbidden Reach]]. We have a [[dragon]] to unchain.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|2|25}}
* 2,400 [[XP]]
* {{Alliance}} +25 [[reputation]] with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* {{Horde}} +25 [[reputation]] with [[Dark Talons]]

==Completion==
<Class>, stand to. We may have a situation.

==Notes==
Upon accept
:{{text|say|Emberthal|Evoker, you may have felt a surge of lost power. Ebyssian and I could use your augmentation abilities in the Forbidden Reach. There is a dragon that needs rescuing.}}

==Progression==
{{Adamanthia}}
