==Objectives==
Rescue 5 [[Frightened Researcher]]s at [[Talonlords' Perch]].
* Researcher rescued (5)
* Find Ebyssian in the [[High Creche]] {{co|58.8|70.4|Forbidden Reach}}

==Description==
The [[Dragonscale Expedition]] does not pose a threat to [[Sarkareth]]. The fact that Sarkareth and his followers would be so brazen as to attack them during their research...

<[[Ebyssian]] furrows his brow.>

Save as many Expedition members as you can. The knowledge in these ruins is priceless if it can unlock the secrets of our past, but it is ultimately worthless when weighed against the value of single innocent life.

I will meet you in the ruins above when I am done here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 350x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +250 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +250 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
We must save as many folk as we can.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. It gladdens me that you were able to save so many... and we are richer in knowledge because of it.

==Notes==
Before leaving, Ebyssian has gossip:
:The Sundered Flame are attacking our people across the Reach. 
:Their aggression is limitless. Their hubris knows no bounds... but to what end?

As does Emberthal:
:I will not let Sarkareth shed more innocent blood.

Find Forbidden Researchers all over [[Talonlords' Perch]]. They can say one of:
*{{text|say|Frightened Researcher|The composition of this stonework is fascinating. Almost like it originated from deep below the earth.}}
*{{text|say|Frightened Researcher|We must preserve this place! The layout is highly ceremonial. The turrets, the winding terraces... What does it all mean?}}
*{{text|say|Frightened Researcher|Don't get blood on these tiles! They date from before the Sundering!}}
*{{text|say|Frightened Researcher|Why would the Sundered Flame defile their own heritage? What are they after?}}
*{{text|say|Frightened Researcher|If I die, make sure someone publishes my work. Better posthumously than never!}}

The researcher on the upper floor at {{co|57.4|63.5|Forbidden Reach}} is next to a book of [[Expedition Notes]], which contains the [[Lost Expedition Notes]] for [[Librarian of the Reach]].

Find Emberthal and Ebyssian in the eastern High Creche building:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|This place, Ebyssian. It feels... familiar.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I sense a great power within it.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Who is this?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|This is an ancient work of magic. I sense Neltharion's handiwork. This construct should have run out of essence long ago.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|The collectors... they are saturated with black dragon essence, far more than what you would detect in any one dragon. It's almost as if...}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|The symbols are conduits of power. If I understand correctly, it is drawing that power from the creches... from the dracthyr themselves.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Neltharion was drawing the essence of the black dragonflight from dracthyr in stasis. This... siphon must have been empowering his dark enchantment while denying that power to the dracthyr.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Whoever this dragon is, she has been trapped in torment for a very long time. We should learn more before attempting to destroy her oubliette.}}

At the High Creche, Ebyssian has new gossip:
:The contents of this room mean more to my flight than you know, <name>.
:Neltharion used the dracthyr as... fuel. He fed off of them, siphoning their essence into this prison. What other machinations did he have? What does this say about the origin of our allies? 
:I worry for them.
:<Ebyssian lets out a heavy sigh.>
:I worry for us all.
