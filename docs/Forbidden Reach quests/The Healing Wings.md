==Objectives==
Speak with [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]].
*(Optional) Ride the [[Soar Enhancer]]

==Description==
Evoker, you have my gratitude for aiding my [[weyrn]] in our most desperate hour.

After we regain our strength, the [[Healing Wings]] will rendezvous with the rest of our forces.

[[Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Cindre]] tells me that Emberthal lost everyone from her weyrn. I fear I have no [[magic]] that can heal such a wound.

She may seem stoic, but Emberthal feels this loss deeply, <name>. Tell her I am on my way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|12|87}}
*3,950 [[XP]]
*[[Crimson Dracthyr Battlegear Treads]]
*"The Healing Wings" criterion of [[Dracthyr, Awaken]]

==Completion==
I am relieved that Viridia lives.

If what [[Dervishian]] says is true, we will have need of her talents in the battle to come.

==Notes==
;On accept
:''Viridia and Cindrethresh walk downstairs toward the gathered [[Talon Mender]]s and [[Azuresworn Drakonid]].''
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|My people need time to recover before we can rendezvous with the others. And the [[Blue drakonid|drakonid]], well... they are not known for their swiftness.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|The drakonid? [[Neltharion]] said we should never show mercy to an enemy.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|They are [[soldier]]s, just like us. Do not judge them too harshly for following orders.}}

As you fly back, two black drakes can be seen in the distance - [[Wrathion]] and [[Ebyssian]].

;Approaching Emberthal
:{{Text|say|Dervishian|The [[Ebon Scales]] are under siege by wild [[drake]]s, [[tarasek]], and [[elemental]]s. I overheard the name "[[Primalists]]".}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Then our people are in even more danger than we thought.}}
