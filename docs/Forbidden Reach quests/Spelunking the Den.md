'''Spelunking the Den''' is a rock climbing World Quest for the [[Dragonscale Expedition]], but in daily quest form.

==Objectives==
Explore the [[Skyfox Den]]'s ceiling using [[Dragonscale Expedition]] climbing gear inside the cave.
* [[Climbing Gear]] {{co|42.6|60.9|Forbidden Reach}}
* Grapple onto the Expedition Climbing Hook
* [[Primalist Cache Key]] {{co|42.7|59.9|Forbidden Reach}}
* Claim the [[Primalist Focus|Primalist Cache Contents]] {{co|43.6|62.1|Forbidden Reach}}

==Description==
Did you have a chance to visit the Skyfox Den? A very exciting place, from what I've heard. Expedition's spelunkers started surveying the cave and even installed a few grappling hooks on the ceiling, but they were scared away by violent [[slyvern]]s.

Can you do me a favor? Get inside the Skyfox Den, grab the abandoned gear, and check the ceiling for any hidden crevices. Who knows what could be hidden inside?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9}}
*9,500 [[XP]]
*450x [[Elemental Overflow]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]
*+350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]
*+350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]

==Progress==
Found anything exciting there?

==Completion==
Well done! My research and writing never end. I'm glad you've seen what's in the den firsthand.

==Notes==

The Climbing Gear is on the ground just inside the Skyfox Den, then interact with the grappling hook on the ceiling to start the rock climbing on stalactite handholds and regular handholds. Get the [[Primalist Cache Key]] from a sack hanging on the other side of the column that players start at, then loop back around to the southeast to get to another grappling hook where the [[Primalist Cache (Forbidden Reach)|Primalist Cache]] is. Open it with the key to obtain the [[Primalist Focus]].
