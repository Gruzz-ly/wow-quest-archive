==Objectives==
Adopt a [[Visage]] Form.
*Ask [[Ebyssian]] about Visage Form
*Learn about Visage Form
*Adopt a Visage Form

==Description==
I am sure your arrival in [[Orgrimmar]] drew the attention of its citizens. No doubt some were more comfortable in your presence than others.

When I was a young [[dragon]], I took on the [[mortal]] visage you now see. It allowed me to live among [[Highmountain tauren|the tauren]] of [[Highmountain]] as an ally.

Though your path differs from mine, the essence of [[dragonkin]]d flows through you as well, <name>. Perhaps that will allow you to assume a visage of your own.

Let us walk together.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
*[[Visage (racial)]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*7,900 [[XP]]
*[[Emboldened Dracthyr's Tabard]]

==Progress==
Tap into your draconic heritage.

==Completion==
You have a noble visage indeed, <name>. Most distinctive.

I do not know why your visage is unique from that of a dragon. Perhaps when we learn more of your past, the answer will present itself.

But for now, we must prepare for the journey ahead.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Ebyssian
:{{Gossip|<Ask about choosing a visage.>}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|I will guide you as best I can, <name>.}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|A visage is an expression of how you wish to be seen by others. It is a personal choice you alone can make.}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|I chose my visage because I wished to live quietly among the Highmountain tauren. Your choice will be your own.}}

An [[Extra Action Button]] appears on-screen, allowing you to cast {{Abilities|Visage Form|id=382916|icon=ability_racial_visage}}. Press it:
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|Good! Find the visage within.}}

Once the cast completes, you assume your visage form and learn the [[Visage (racial)]] and [[Chosen Identity]] spells.

==Progression==
{{The Dark Talons}}

==Alpha version==
{{Rfa-section|Dragonflight}}
;Description
The people of [[Azeroth|this world]] have had... mixed relationships with [[dragonkin]]d over the centuries.

An appearance more familiar to them may help to smooth over this transitional period and make everyone more comfortable.

As draconic creatures, the ability resides within you to adopt a visage form. We just have to unlock it.

;Last line of dialogue
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|The same [[magic]] is within you. Look inside and focus on a form that reflects how you want the world to see you.}}
