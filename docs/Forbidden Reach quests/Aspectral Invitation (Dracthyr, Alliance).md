==Objectives==
Speak with Wrathion to learn of the Council's meeting.
*Speak with [[Wrathion]]

==Description==
Ah, <name>. I trust your tour of [[Stormwind City|the city]] went well.

No one threw any fruit at you, did they? I am told [[Where Kings Walk|that happens sometimes]].

At any rate, I just finished meeting with Lord Commander [[Turalyon]] and his allies, and they have accepted the [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]]' invitation to the [[Dragon Isles]].

Preparations are underway for a journey to your homeland.

Ah, but where are my manners? We should have a chat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,150 [[XP]]
*{{Cost|2|57|40}}

==Completion==
There is much more to the Dragon Isles beyond the [[Forbidden Reach]]. I cannot wait for you to see it!

Now then, I believe that diminutive archaeologist said something about putting together an expedition.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Wrathion
:Ah, there you are, <name>. Impeccable timing!

:I briefed Lord Commander Turalyon on recent events, and have extended the Aspects' invitation to the Dragon Isles.

:We just have a few more details to discuss.
