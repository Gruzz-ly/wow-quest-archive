==Objectives==
Hunt down elite creatures across the [[Forbidden Reach]].
*Elite creatures slain in Forbidden Reach (5)
Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
This land is crawling with opportunities for a skilled hunter. We want you to join the hunt. 

Some threats are feral. Dare I say it, some are greatest threats are sentient and malevolent. If we all work together, we can make the Reach a safe haven, as it used to be.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9}}
*9500 [[XP]]
*450x [[Elemental Overflow]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
*+350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]
*+350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]

==Progress==
Do those dangers still roam the land?

==Completion==
I like how you deal with problems. I'm sure they got what they deserved.

==Notes==
The map shows elites in the majority of the map, so any elite not in the [[War Creche]] counts.

==Progression==
{{Morqut Village envoys}}
