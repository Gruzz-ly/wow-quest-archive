==Objectives==
Collect Everburning Embers from powerful fire [[Primalists]] in the [[Siege Creche]].
* [[Everburning Ember (Dragonflight)]] (14) {{co|74|55|Forbidden Reach}}
*Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
Warmth and heat are constant concerns for us at the homestead. We don't want to burn through everything we brought, and we don't like collecting driftwood on hostile shores. Too risky!

The Primalists, though, carry some of their own fire with them.

If you could slay some powerful fire Primalists, take their Everburning Embers, and bring those embers back here, we could make good use of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 350x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Everburning Embers could certainly help keep the camp warm all year round.

==Completion==
These are perfect! They will help keep us warm on the coldest nights. Even when the weather is terrible, they will help keep the cooking fires lit.

Thank you! May you always have a warm welcome here.

==Notes==
The [[Siege Creche]] of [[Stormsunder Crater]], not the [[War Creche]]. Valid targets include [[Primal Blaze]]s, [[Primal Magmawing]]s, [[Veteran Cauterizer]]s and [[Veteran Flameguard]]s.

==Progression==
{{Morqut Village weeklies}}
