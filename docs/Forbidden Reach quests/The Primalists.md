==Description==
My memories are still clouded from stasis, but I am certain we have encountered these Primalists before.

<Dervishian grits her fangs.>

It is no use. Trying to remember feels like chasing fragments of a dream.

Perhaps you can fare better. Look for any clues as to what--or who--motivates these invaders.

*7,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The Primalist speaks of unleashing a terrible storm.

Could an even greater threat be locked away somewhere on the Reach?
