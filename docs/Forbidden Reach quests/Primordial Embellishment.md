==Objectives==
Collect the Primordial Jeweler's Kit and the Primordial Anvil from the [[Zskera Vaults]].
* [[Primordial Jeweler's Kit]] {{co|31.2|55.9|Forbidden Reach}}
* [[Primordial Anvil]] {{co|29.1|57.9|Forbidden Reach}}

==Description==
[[File:Primordial Anvil.jpg|thumb|Primordial Anvil]]
How remarkable! You can affix such a variety of special gems to enhance its power!

You should journey back into the Zskera Vaults and locate a Primordial Jeweler's Kit. Yes, that's what you'll need.

Crafting gems of this type requires specialized tools. Once we have them, we can fully explore the ring's power! The mind reels with limitless possibilities...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find it?

==Completion==
There's far more here than I expected! 

I never dreamt to see such wonders. With these tools, we could even craft another ring! Just in case you lose that one... or, say, want to give one to... 

Oh, forgive me! I am presumptuous. It's just so... wonderful.

==Notes==
[[File:Primordial Embellishment after.jpg|thumb|New goodies in [[Morqut Village]]]]
Despite the rooms themselves being randomized player to player and week to week, the spawn locations for the quest items are fixed: The jeweler's kit is in the eastern room on the lower level and the anvil is in the southern room on the second level.

On complete:
:''Imareth walks over and scatters the items nearby, including placing the anvil under [[Ham'urit]].''
:{{text|say|Researcher Imareth|This opens a number of new possibilities!}}

Stones can be freely removed from the annulet by standing in front of the Primordial Jeweler's Kit and using the [[Extra Action Button]] that appears:
:{{Abilities|Pluck Out Primordial Stone|Pull out an ingrained Primordial Stone from an Onyx Anulet.|id=405805|icon=inv_10_dungeonjewelry_primalist_ring_4_omni}}

Unwanted stones can be broken down in front of [[Ham'urit]], next to the jeweler's kit, into 6x [[Dormant Primordial Fragment]], also using an Extra Action Button:
:{{Abilities|Break Primordial Stone|Smashes a Primordial Stone into pieces.|id=405721|icon=inv_ore_blacktrilliumnugget}}

Ten fragments can then be used with an [[Unstable Elementium]] (from Jewelcrafters) to upgrade the item level of stones.
