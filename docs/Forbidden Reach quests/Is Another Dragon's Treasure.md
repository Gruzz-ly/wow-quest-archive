==Objectives==
Talk to [[Voraxian]] in the [[Forbidden Reach]].
*Suggest a suitable person to Voraxian

==Description==
I must admit, I am out of my depth here. 

It is of [[black dragon]] make. The decoration on the pommel matches, but I have no idea what it is. Which I suppose is the point.

I have heard you have travelled{{sic}} [[Dragon Isles|the Isles]]. Do you have any recommendations on who to talk to?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It is a fascinating object. I am tempted to tell [[Evorian]] it's a weapon just to see what happens when he tries to use it... but I suppose not. It might actually be really dangerous.

Would be fun to see his scales singed a bit though.

==Completion==
You think this Veritistrasz could help? I am willing to give it a shot!

Good suggestion, <name>.

==Notes==
Speak with Voraxian again:
:Who should we talk to about the device?
*{{gossip|We could ask [[Alexstrasza]]?}}
:What? The Mother of [[Dragon]]s? 
:Oh, no. I would not want to bother her with this trifle. She is very important, and she probably does not have time for us. 
:I am sure she is doing important... Dragon... Mother... Things.
:{{gossip|She would make time for me.}}
:Ok, look. She is older than continents. She is wise. One look from her, and it's like she has seen everything you are and might be. 
:Quite frankly, I find her very intimidating.
:*{{gossip|She is nice when you get to know her.}}
::She was at war with [[Black dragonflight|my flight]] for the last ten thousand years. 
::I am sure she is very nice to you, but I would prefer another alternative if at all possible.
::{{gossip|I have another suggestion}}
:*{{gossip|She scares me too.}}
::Finally!
::You get it. 
::Oh, that is quite the wind under my wings that another person feels the same way.
:*{{gossip|Yeah, I don't like her either.}}
::It is not that I do not like her, I have not interacted with her to have that opinion.
::I just... she has been at war with my flight for ten thousand years. Who wouldn't hold a grudge after that long?
*{{gossip|What about [[Sabellian]]?}}
:No. He did serve under [[Neltharion]] during his... bad days... but at the time, they were not really "cultured" types.
:{{gossip|I have another suggestion}}
*{{gossip|What about [[Wrathion]]?}}
:Ah, no. No I don't think so. He seems like a good whelp, but he is a bit young to be an expert on the artifacts of ancient black dragons.
:{{gossip|I have another suggestion}}
*{{gossip|We could ask the [[Dragonscale Expedition|Dragonscale expedition]]?}}
:They could work, but when they came to the [[Obsidian Citadel]], they said it would take them a year to identify the origin of some of the tables we had. 
:How ridiculous. They are tables! They are for putting things on! You don't need to know their origin. I would like to understand what we have found sometime in this century. 
:That is good thinking, though. Do you have any other suggestions?
:{{gossip|I have another suggestion}}

After exhausting all of the above options, Voraxian has one last gossip option:
:{{gossip|I know an old dragon named [[Veritistrasz]] that could help?}}
:''This completes the quest objective.''
