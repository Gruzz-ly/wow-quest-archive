==Objectives==
Meet [[Zenata]] at [[Dragonskull Island|Dragonskull Cave]] in [[Forbidden Reach]].

==Description==
I tuned my various sensors for [[Dracthyr]] relics, and they've triangulated a new location for us to investigate off the eastern coast of the Forbidden Reach. 

The local [[Drakonid]] tell me it's named Dragonskull Island. Ominous, no? You're not easily frightened, are you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost |2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My preliminary sensors are peaking when near the cave entrances. What we're looking for is most certainly inside.

==Progression==
{{Azerothian Archives}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.2.5|note=Added.}}
