==Objectives==
Help the dracthyr scouts secure the [[Lost Atheneum]].
* Assist Emberthal's Scouts (3)
* Secure the Lost Atheneum (0/100%)

==Description==
Glad you could make it, soldier.

<[[Talon Damos|Damos]] gives you a sardonic salute.>

This is surreal. We're back in a place we knew long ago. Now it's in ruins. And it's crawling with all kinds of new wildlife. 

I guess it's true what they say. You can never go home again.

Enough talking. Time to work. [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] wants this place locked down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 350x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +250 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +250 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Completion==
Thanks for the assistance, <name>. You're a real asset in the field.

After this is over, we should meet up in [[Valdrakken]]. I think there's a couple watering holes with our names on 'em.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Talon Damos|There's beauty in these ruins.}}
:{{text|say|Talon Damos|Maybe our past is worth saving.}}

Damos has new gossip:
:Keep an eye on the sky and an ear to the ground.

As does Emberthal, who is located in the ruins behind Damos
:There is so much we do not know about our past... about our future....
:I intend to change that.

Defeat enemies in the area to fill the bar, including [[Invasive Scalecrawler|invasive scalecrawlers]], [[Tarasek Scavenger|tarasek scavengers]], and [[Tarasek Stormcaller|stormcallers]].

The talons in the area all have things to say when approached:
:{{text|say|[[Talon Tetsos]]|Watch yourself, <name>! There's a monstrous creche-crawler up above.}}
:{{text|say|[[Talon Arrosh]]|Ugh, my head's starting to swim...}}
:{{text|say|Talon Tetsos|Easy there, Arrosh. We'll get you out of here.}}

Defeat the [[Skittering Ruinstalker]] spider upstairs for one of the three "assist" objectives.

Downstairs to the west is Ekrati with a pile of [[Suspicious Rubble]]:
:{{text|say|[[Talon Ekrati]]|Careful, <name>! There's something under there...}}

An obvious trap, interacting with it pops out a [[Nesting Creche Crawler]]. Defeat it for more quest progress.

In the lower area is [[Talon Hermin]] with a bunch of [[Damaged Tome]]s strewn across the floor:
:{{text|say|Talon Hermin|Over here! Someone's been through these books. Appears recent too.}} <!-- As far as I could tell from the voice line. Text doesn't appear in the chat. -->

Pick up a book:
:{{text|say|Talon Hermin|It seems the "A" sections of these tomes have been torn out. Strange... You'd best inform Emberthal.}}

On complete, an [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|hsmnIGxMsmo}}
:{{text|say|Talon Damos|Good. You're here.}}
:{{text|say|Talon Damos|I would just as soon never set foot in a creche again.}}
:{{text|say|Talon Damos|Emberthal awaits you inside.}}
:''The player starts walking in, but Damos interrupts them.''
:{{text|say|Talon Damos|Oh, and... (clears throat)... thank you. For aiding us.}}
:''The player nods and walks inside, spotting Emberthal off to the right looking at some bookshelves.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Damos speaks highly of you...}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Not something he does often.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|He and the others are looking for answers... a reason for all of this.}}
:''Emberthal turns and walks to more books on a table with the player following.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|After everything that's happened, everything we've been through...}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I'm beginning to wonder if... (sigh)... what I'm looking for isn't here.}}
:''From offscreen, Emberthal yells an alarm!''
:{{text|say|Talon Damos|Emberthal!}}
:{{text|say|Talon Damos|Aagugh!}}
:''Emberthal and the player run out to see Sakareth standing on the end of the platform and two other dracthyr flying away. Sarkareth turns around to gloat.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Oh no... No...}}
:{{text|say|Talon Damos|(death rattle)}}
:{{text|say|[[Scalecommander Sarkareth]]|Begone. The Reach belongs to the Sundered Flame.}}
:''Not even bothering to wait for a response, Sarkareth turns around and flies away as Emberthal sprints out toward him.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|SARKARETH!}}
:''Emberthal stops when she realizes that she won't be able to reach him and kneels down to look at Damos.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|(exhales)}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Damos...}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I'm so sorry.}}
:''Ebyssian flies in.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|(labored heavy breathing, grief turning to rage, building in determination)}}
