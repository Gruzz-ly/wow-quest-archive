[[File:Sneaky Pebbles.jpg|thumb|Throwing an Infuser Crystal at an Infused Beetle]]

==Objectives==
12 Infused Beetles Defeated.
*[[Infused Beetle]] defeated (12)

==Description==
[[File:Infuser Crystal.jpg|thumb|upright|Infuser Crystal]]
Beetles are swarming our [[Support Creche|support creche]]! Some of them are now eating pieces of broken Infusers, and that's making them stronger. We keep trying to smush them, but they won't stay smushed.

Now it's harder to get rid of them, but we have a plan. We've discovered that hitting them with pieces of broken Infusers can weaken them again!

Do you mind helping us clear out these Infused Beetles?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 450x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==

Have you cleared those beetles yet?

I knew we'd discover new wildlife when we returned to the Reach, but this isn't what I wanted. Also, I'm getting really tired of treating bug bites.

==Completion==
Amazing work! Now we it will be easier for us to reclaim the support creche.

==Notes==
Outside the [[Support Creche]] at [[Caldera of the Menders]], find glowing Infuser Shards all over the grounds. Interact with one to enter the vehicle interface with one ability:
#{{Abilities|Throw Infuser Shard|Throw the Infuser Shard at nearby Empowered Dragonbane Beetles.|cd=5 sec|id=404970|icon=inv_datacrystal01}}

Use this to hit ''friendly'' Infused Beetles within throwing range. There will generally be one or two beetles in range of each shard.

Several beetles are hidden behind buildings, so a simple <code>/tar Infused</code> will help locate them.
