'''More Doors to Open''' concludes the [[Zskera Vaults]] quest chain. [[Pathfinder Jeb]] will offer this quest each week going forward.

==Objectives==
Enter and explore additional [[Zskera Vaults]].
* Speak with [[Pathfinder Jeb]] to enter the vault
* Secure the Vault
* Doors opened with Zskera Vault Keys

==Description==
There are still more vaults, but there aren't enough of us to explore them all.

That's where you come in. Could you look for more keys? Then we can continue exploring the vaults.

[[Pathfinder Tacha|Tacha]] and I will stay here and work on documenting our earlier discoveries. That's tough work, but one of us has to do it. Okay, two of us. But it is a lot of work, I assure you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you explored the vault?

==Completion==
Look at you! Opening doors! Having adventures! That's... a-door-able.

Sorry. Long day. Good work in there. As long we have keys, we'll find more adventure. And I'm fairly sure we'll find another vault in a few days. 

You and me! And Tacha! Exploring the unknown. Well, mostly you, but we're helping.

==Progress==
{{Zskera Vaults}}
