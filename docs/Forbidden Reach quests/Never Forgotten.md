==Objectives==
Recover items and survivors from within the [[Support Creche]].
*Horn signets collected (3)
*[[Report: Infestation|Clues discovered]]
*Survivors Rescued (10)
*[[Toxin Antidote]] (provided)

==Description==
The antidote is ready. Use it to search the Support Creche for survivors. Work quickly--the effect will not last long, so you may have to reapply it.

If any of my people yet draw breath, save them.

And if they do not, I ask that you recover their horn signets so that their names may be honored.

While inside, perhaps you can find evidence of how this infestation came to be.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*[[Hover]]

You will receive:
*{{Cost|51|48}}
*9,850 [[XP]]
*[[Verdant Dracthyr's Band]]

==Progress==
None shall die or suffer if it is within my power to prevent it.

==Completion==
Thank you for rescuing those who could be saved.

[[Rethenash]]. [[Katrinasa]]. [[Tenezeth]].

I vow that the names of the fallen will be remembered.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|Please, <name>. Save all of my people that you can. And honor the memories of the fallen.}}

Entering the creche allows using the Toxin Antidote extra action button available to reduce the toxicity of the Choking bar.

On the stairs, loot [[Report: Infestation]].

Find the bodies [[Rethenash]], [[Katrinasa]], and [[Tenezeth]], and loot [[Horn Signet|their signets]]:
*[[Horn Signet of Rethenash]]
*[[Horn Signet of Tenezeth]]
*[[Horn Signet of Katrinasa]]

Like in the first creche, pick up the [[Crystal Key]] and place it on the [[Crystal Lock]]. The barrier becomes disabled and the Injured Talons leave the creche.

==Progression==
{{The Healing Wings}}
