*Complete any of the two in Advanced or Reverse mode (optional)

==Description==
You and your drakes seem to enjoy your adventures in Forbidden Reach, don't you? 

I heard the windstreams in the central Forbidden Reach are especially good today. Why don't you try a few courses out there?

You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9}}
*9500 [[XP]]
*450x [[Elemental Overflow]]

==Progress==
Having fun?

==Completion==
You both look you had quite a workout. Way to go!

==Notes==
The Aerie Chasm Cruise starts at {{co|63.1|52.0|Forbidden Reach}} west across the chasm from [[Stormsunder Crater]] and southeast of [[Froststone Vault]]. The Forbidden Reach Rush starts at {{co|49.4|60.1|Forbidden Reach}} above and to the south of the entrance to the [[War Creche]] in the [[Old Weyrn Grounds]]. Pick either (if attempting an advanced or reverse race), or both (if doing normal races).
