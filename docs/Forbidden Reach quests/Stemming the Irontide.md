==Objectives==
Slay 8 [[Irontide Raiders|Irontide Pirates]] on the [[Tempest Coast]].
* Slay 10 Irontide Pirates

==Description==
Unfortunately, we are not the only ones who took notice of opportunities in the Reach. 

Our scouts have sent word of [[pirate]] vessels moored offshore. The first longboats have apparently come ashore on our northeastern beaches.

Our history is not theirs to plunder. If you come across these pirates, send them swimming back to their little boats.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 350x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +250 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +250 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
What news of the pirates, <name>?

==Completion==
You have my thanks. With luck, these brigands will take heed.

We're willing to defend these lands and the secrets they contain.

==Notes==
To the northwest on [[Morqut Islet]] and across the way on the [[Tempest Coast]] are Irontide landing locations. Defeat any hostiles, including [[Irontide Brinecaster|brinecasters]], [[Irontide Bulwark|bulwarks]], [[Irontide Crackshot|crackshots]], [[Irontide Crusher|crushers]], [[Irontide Cutthroat|cutthroats]], and [[Irontide Squawker|squawkers]].
