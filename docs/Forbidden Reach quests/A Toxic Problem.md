==Objectives==
Collect 6 Toxin Glands.
*[[Toxin Gland (Forbidden Reach)]] (6)

==Description==
You recover quickly, <name>. Good.

Those who escaped [[Support Creche|my creche]] are healing, but others remain trapped inside. Rush in to save them and I will just have to drag you out again.

There are [[beetle]] nests scattered around the [[Caldera of the Menders|caldera]]. Their toxin glands might provide a way to counter the effects of that poison.

I am in no shape to collect them myself. I must rely upon your skills, evoker.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|50|60}}
*7,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Time runs short.

==Completion==
Good. These are just what I needed.

I will work on something to counter the toxin and get you back into the creche.

==Trivia==
During the alpha, the quest was named '''Crafting an Antidote'''.

==Progression==
{{The Healing Wings}}
