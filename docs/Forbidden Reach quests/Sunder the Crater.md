==Description==
[[File:Sunder the Crater.jpg|thumb|The Adept Stormbringer and a Primalist totem]]
The Primalists have moved into Stormsunder Crater. They're raising elementals and exploiting the land.

They should be dealt with in a swift and decisive manner. Thin their ranks. Destroy their totems. Help us make the Forbidden Reach safe for the dracthyr, the tuskarr, and all the dispossessed who want to call it home again.

* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +500 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +500 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Have you taken care of the Primalists in Stormsunder Crater?

==Completion==
Well done. You just did some serious damage to their plans here in the Forbidden Reach.

==Notes==
Humanoid Primalists, not their elemental summons.
