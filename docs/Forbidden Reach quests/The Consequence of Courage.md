==Description==
Thank you for healing me, <name>. I hope that we are earning one another's trust.

<[[Wrathion]] shudders.>

[[Raszageth|The Storm-Eater]]. I have never faced a [[dragon]] of such raw [[elemental]] power. If there are others like her...

Wait... where is Ebyssian? Did he survive? You must find him!

*{{Cost|25|74}}
*7,900 [[XP]]
*[[Crimson Dracthyr Battlegear Monnion]]

I am relieved you made it out, <name>.

But I.. cannot help but feel lost.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Wrathion]]|You have my thanks, [[dracthyr]]. Now please, find--}}
:{{Text|say|[[Scalecommander Sarkareth]]|Tell us, dragon! Did the Incarnate speak the truth? Is [[Neltharion]] dead?}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|The Neltharion you knew fell long, long ago. It is a... complicated tale.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Scalecommander Emberthal]]|Our legacy... lost.}}

Up ahead are [[Windfiend]]s, and Ebyssian is fighting a [[Fused Tarasek]] further down.

:''Raszageth suddenly swoops down and captures Ebyssian.''
:{{Text|yell|Raszageth|Ahahaha! Is this all that remains of Neltharion's flight? Pathetic!}}

Continue to [[Scaleborn Pass]] and find an Injured Ebyssian under a rubble of stones.
:{{Text|yell|Ebyssian|Over... here...}}

Heal him with your abilities.
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|Thank you, <name>. That should... be... ENOUGH!}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|I thought I would be the one saving you. Dracthyr are formidable indeed.}}
:''Ebyssian flies to the [[Old Weyrn Grounds]].''
