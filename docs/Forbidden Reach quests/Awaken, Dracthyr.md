==Objectives==
Awaken the other [[dracthyr]].
*Dracthyr ally awakened (1)
*[[Talon Kethahn|Kethahn]] found
*[[Tethalash]] awakened
*[[Scalecommander Azurathel|Azurathel]] awakened
*Speak with Scalecommander Azurathel.

==Description==
<Only flashes of memory remain as you shake off what feels like an endless sleep.

The dracthyr before you is unresponsive, frozen in place by some unknown [[magic]]. You sense that within you lies the power to break your ally free.

There may be others within [[War Creche|the creche]] who are suspended in this stasis.

It is your duty to awaken them.>

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*[[Disintegrate]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|25|27|20}}
*7,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Azurathel listens to your report.>

My memories are as broken as yours, <name>. But we cannot dwell on that now.

We need to assess and make a plan.

==Notes==
Start by freeing {{Alliance}} [[Dervishian]] or {{Horde}} [[Kodethi]] from stasis.

:{{Text|Say|Dervishian/Kodethi|Wha... what... <Name>! What has happened? Who did this to us?!}}
:{{Text|Say|Dervishian/Kodethi|Something is very wrong here. We must find our wing mates. This way!}}

Dervishian leaps off the ledge and glides down below. Follow her.

:{{Text|bossemote|Press Jump while falling to Glide.}}

As you land, you can approach a half-open door and hear dragons barring the entrance.

:{{Text|Say|[[Lapisagos]]|The dracthyr are breaking free! Contain them!}}

You will find [[Talon Kethahn]] buried under debris in a nearby room.

:<These bones are brittle from the long decay of time. Have they been here for decades? Centuries? Impossible to know.

:A faint hint lingers of the [[arcane]] magic that held Kethahn in stasis.

:You feel a pang of loss. He was your friend.>

Free [[Tethalash]] in the center.

:{{Text|Say|Tethalash|I remember... obeying an order.}}

The quartermaster runs off. Follow.

:{{Text|Say|Dervishian|In here, evoker.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Kodethi]]|How long were we held in stasis?}}
:{{Text|Say|Dervishian|A very long time, by the look of our creche.}}

Free [[Scalecommander Azurathel]].

:{{Text|Say|Scalecommander Azurathel|Ungh... my head... Alright, we need to get our bearings.}}
