'''An Odd Round Object''' starts by looting the [[Odd Round Object]] in a random room of the [[Zskera Vaults]] after completing [[Verbal Archaeology]].

==Objectives==
Bring the Odd Round Object to [[Voraxian]] in [[Rusza'thar Reach]].
*[[Odd Round Object]] (provided)

==Description==
<This object looked out of place in the [[Zskera Vaults]]. It is round, with three claw-like divots in it. Perhaps it is of interest to Voraxian.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hmm, round... clearly claw holes... squishes a bit... I have no idea what this is. Perhaps some form of thrown weapon?

How exciting!

==Progression==
{{Verbal Archaeology}}

==Patch changes==
