==Objectives==
Disrupt 4 Essence Collectors.
*[[Essence Collector]] (4)

==Description==
Have you felt it? We have already started bringing the barrier down. This prison for [[Adamanthia]] held so much power. And now I can augment again! A fully trained [[evoker]] was always intended to empower their allies, as much as healing or devastation. I remember that now... and more. I am starting to remember who this imprisoned [[black dragon]] was... who she was to all [[dracthyr]]. Please, <name>, help me remove these shackles.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* {{Alliance}} +250 [[reputation]] with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* {{Horde}} +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
The vindictiveness of this trap... how could we have been so blind to [[Deathwing|Neltharian]]{{sic}}'s cruelty?

==Completion==
Well done. We will need Ebyssian to sunder the last strand of magic sustaining this imprisonment.

==Progression==
{{Adamanthia}}

==Patch changes==
