==Objectives==
Meet [[Scalecommander Emberthal]] on [[Dragonskull Island]].

==Description==
"He awaits you in the darkness"?

<Emberthal's eyes narrow.>

I know where [[Sarkareth]] is.

I'll need your help holding him to account. If you want, you could stay here a while and pick through these ruins, but I think we have more pressing needs at hand. If you're willing to see this through to the end, then I need you to follow me.

I'm going to Dragonskull Island.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +75 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +75 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Completion==
I knew you'd come. 

Thank you, <name>.

:{{text|say|Ebyssian|We should be cautious.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|You spent too long sulking in your cave, old dragon. If you won't help me, I'll claim justice myself.}}
:''Emberthal runs off.''
