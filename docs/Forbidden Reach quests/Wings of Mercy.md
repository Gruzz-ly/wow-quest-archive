==Objectives==
Aid [[Dracthyr]] Scouts at three locations on the [[Forbidden Reach]].
* [[Tempest Coast]] Scouts aided {{co|36.9|43.2|Forbidden Reach}}
* [[Stormsunder Crater]] Scouts aided {{co|64.6|61.9|Forbidden Reach}}
* [[Darksand Hollow]] Scouts added

==Description==
With the lifting of the storms, we dispatched [[scout]] teams to explore the island. 

Several of our teams have not returned. We fear they may have fallen to unknown dangers.

Can you search the island for them? Once you locate them, use the mender's signal to summon a medic.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 300x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +250 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +250 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Have you found the scouts?

==Completion==
I am grateful for the help you have given our scouts.

==Notes==
North of Morqut Village is the [[Tempest Coast]], an [[Irontide Raiders]] landing location. Up the hill are a [[Dracthyr Scout]] and an [[Injured Dracthyr]]:
:{{text|say|Injured Dracthyr|These pirates know no decency, they are here just to loot and plunder.}}

Use the [[Extra Action Button]]:
:{{abilities|Mender's Signal|Signal Viridia's Menders to heal injured dracthyr at this location.|id=399300|image=|range=10|cd=15 sec|notes=1.5 sec cast}}

Note that the ability will aggro any nearby hostiles, so consider clearing them out before using it.

Two menders fly in:
:{{text|say|Dracthyr Mender|We have you.}}

Far to the east is the [[Stormsunder Crater]]. Another dracthyr scout and injured dracthyr are on a platform southwest of the crater proper:
:{{text|say|Injured Dracthyr|Thank you for coming. The strong elemental presence here surprised us.}}

Use the extra action button and two menders fly in again:
:{{text|say|Dracthyr Mender|Let's get you back to base.}}

Further east is the [[Darksand Hollow]], the eastern shore of the mainland, where Farscale naga have set up a beachhead:
:{{text|say|Dracthyr Scout|Now that the storms have lifted, these naga are swarming ashore and pillaging the ruins!}}

Once more with the extra action button:
:{{text|say|Dracthyr Mender|Eyes up, soldier. You're not done fighting yet.}}
