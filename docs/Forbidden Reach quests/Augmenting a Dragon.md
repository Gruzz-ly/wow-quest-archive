==Objectives==
Help Ebyssian subdue Adamanthia.
*Speak with [[Ebyssian]] to initiate the ritual
*[[Adamanthia]] subdued

==Description==
Adamanthia! She has been imprisoned for ages, trapped in torment. While the [[dracthyr]] slept, she suffered. I can only hope she has not given in to [[Deathwing]]'s madness during her long imprisonment. The passage of time may have shattered her mind. Be ready, champion. Should she lash out, aid Ebyssian. Augment his abilities, so he can subdue Adamanthia instead of slaying her. She has earned a chance. We must give it to her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* [[Nelthara]]
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* {{Alliance}} +350 [[reputation]] with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* {{Horde}} +350 [[reputation]] with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Adamanthia has waited long enough for this day. Let us hope it has not come too late.

==Completion==
We... are good.

I think... she will be okay after this. Thank you, <class>. Now we can get Adamanthia the help and healing she needs, so we can welcome her to this new world.
