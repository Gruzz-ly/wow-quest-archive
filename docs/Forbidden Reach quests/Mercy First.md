==Description==
The toxicity in the creche nearly claimed us all. While the antidote is being prepared, I need you to seek out the wounded and heal them.

Yes, even the [[blue drakonid]]. The [[Healing Wings]] do not stand idly by while others suffer.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*[[Emerald Blossom]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*7,900 [[XP]]
*[[Crimson Dracthyr Battlegear Grips]]

==Progress==
The toxins flooding the creche could not penetrate the stasis [[magic]], but it engulfed us when we awakened.

==Completion==
Violence is not the only avenue to victory.
