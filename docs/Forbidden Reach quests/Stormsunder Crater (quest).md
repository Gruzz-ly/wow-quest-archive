==Objectives==
Meet [[Scalecommander Azurathel|Azurathel]] at [[Stormsunder Crater]].
*Speak with Azurathel in Stormsunder Crater.

==Description==
[[Dervishian]]'s report is troubling. An enemy force calling themselves the [[Primalists]] have invaded Stormsunder Crater, pinning the [[Ebon Scales]] down at the [[Siege Creche]].

These intruders are summoning violent [[elemental]]s and recruiting the vicious [[tarasek]] to their cause.

Azurathel will need your help at the crater. By wing or by talon, save our people.

Once the Ebon Scales are safe, ask their commander to rendezvous with me. Be warned. [[Scalecommander Sarkareth|Sarkareth]] can be... prickly.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
*[[Deep Breath]]

You will receive:
*{{Cost|12|87}}
*3,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well, <class>, I hope you are ready to get your talons dirty.
