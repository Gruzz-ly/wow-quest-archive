==Objectives==
Fly the [[Dragonriding races|race courses]] in the western [[Forbidden Reach]].

Finish any Advanced or Reverse course of the two to instantly complete the quest.
*Morqut Ascent completed {{co|31.3|65.7|Forbidden Reach}}
*Caldera Coaster completed {{co|41.4|14.6|Forbidden Reach}}
*Complete any of the two in Advanced or Reverse mode (optional)

==Description==
You and your drakes seem to enjoy your adventures in Forbidden Reach, don't you? 

I heard the windstreams in the western Forbidden Reach are especially good today. Why don't you try a few courses out there?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9}}
*11,900 [[XP]]
*450x [[Elemental Overflow]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
*+350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]
*+350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]

==Progress==
Having fun?

==Completion==
You both look you had quite a workout. Way to go!

==Notes==
Morqut Ascent is just to the south at {{co|31.3|65.7|Forbidden Reach}}, and the Caldera Coaster is at [[Skyward Watch]] far to the north at {{co|41.4|14.6|Forbidden Reach}}. Pick either (if attempting an advanced or reverse race), or both (if doing normal races).

==Progression==
{{Morqut Village envoys}}
