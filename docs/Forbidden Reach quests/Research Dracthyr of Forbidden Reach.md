'''Research: Dracthyr of Forbidden Reach''' is an [[Azerothian Archives]] world quest that is unlocked upon completion of [[Finally, An Archivist!]]. It takes place at {{co|53|48|Forbidden Reach}} at the [[Lost Atheneum]] in the [[Forbidden Reach]].

==Objectives==
* Speak with [[Reese]] {{co|53.6|47.6|Forbidden Reach}}
* Information Collected (0/100%)

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[Nirobin]]|Good. I require your services to conduct further research on these ruins.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* {{cost|640}}
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Nirobin|Good enough for now, assistant! I require time to study these findings before we return.}}

==Notes==
Interact with [[Reese]] at the south end of the marked quest area, and it releases Clue Seekers all over. Go to each blue spot and use the Gain Clue extra action button to fill the bar. Also be on the look out for [[Juicy Clue]]s.

Completing this world quest adds a page to the [[Tome of Archived Isles Research]] at {{co|58.5|36.7|Thaldraszus}} in [[Nirobin]]'s office at [[Algeth'ar Academy]] in [[Thaldraszus]]:

{{book|content=Information acquired from the Lost Atheneum, Forbidden Reach, Dragon Isles, Azeroth:

This goblet is not enveloped in merriment and joy like one would expect but sorrow--sorrow born of its owner's sense of impending doom.}}

After completing the world quest a second time, the page is filled in with more information:

{{book|content= ﻿My data has uncovered fragments of rebellious missives sent from the goblet's owner to several dracthyr of their creche. Secrecy would have been paramount, as any resistance to Neltharion was responded to with swift prejudice.}}

After completing the world quest a third time, the page is completed:

{{book|content= ﻿﻿Ah... The owner of this goblet was indeed "dealt with" by Neltharion or his agents. Truly unfortunate.

Would that I could go back and inform them just how courageous their beliefs were.}}

==Progression==
