==Objectives==
Collect fish to restock the fishing hole and mount your drake to drop them from above.
*Collect Stock Fish (3) {{co|84|30|Forbidden Reach}}
*Drop the fish from above (3)
*[[Throw Net]] (provided)

==Description==
The fish could be biting better, don't you think?

You know, that gives me an idea. Legend says these lakes and rivers did not always have fish. They say, these watering holes were stocked with fish when the [[dragon]]s soaring overhead dropped them! Can you believe it?

Maybe you and your drake could give it a try?

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Restock Fish|Increases the remaining stock of fish by 20.|id=386887|icon=achievement_profession_fishing_findfish}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|4|50}}
*4550 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]

==Progress==
Have you dropped those fish yet?

==Completion==
Ha! The legends are true, how fantastic!

==Notes==
The stock fish are on the northeast side of [[Dragonskull Island]]. Collect three, then mount up and fly back to the quest giver, where an [[Extra Action Button]] appears:
:{{Abilities|Release Fish|Drop stock fish into the water to restock the fishing hole.|id=385852|icon=inv_misc_fish_76}}

Use the extra action button while dragonriding over the water.

Completing this quest counts for 80% progress toward [[Angler's Challenge]].
