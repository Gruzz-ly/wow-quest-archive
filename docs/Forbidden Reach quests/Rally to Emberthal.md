==Objectives==
Report to [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]].
*(Optional) Ride the [[Soar Enhancer]]

==Description==
Now that the fight is done, you ask me to report in to Emberthal. Does [[Scalecommander Azurathel|Azurathel]] expect me to follow her commands?

I think not.

The [[Ebon Scales]] answer only to the [[Deathwing|Earth-Warder]]. And thus far, I have received no orders from Neltharion.

<[[Scalecommander Sarkareth|Sarkareth]] glowers.>

Still, I am not blind to the threat these [[Primalists]] represent. I am certain I have fought their kind before, and yet...

We will rally to the grounds once my people have recovered. You are dismissed, evoker.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|12|87}}
*3,950 [[XP]]
*"The Ebon Scales" criterion of [[Dracthyr, Awaken]]

==Completion==
The Primalists empowered their leader in some kind of ritual?

Tell me everything.

:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|As you will. But stay alert. There are [[dragon]]s circling above. Possibly hostile.}}

:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|These [[cultist]]s speak of unleashing a storm.}}
:''Two black dragons land on the ground.''
:{{Text|say|[[Ebyssian]]|The threat is greater than you know, young ones.}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|We fear these Primalists seek to release something ancient... something terrible.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Why should we trust you?}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Were you sent by the Earth-Warder?}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Where is Neltharion?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Wrathion]]|Neltharion?}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|It seems there is... much you do not know.}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|I am Ebyssian, and this is Wrathion.}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|We will answer all your questions in time.}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|But we must join forces and strike now, or the enemy will prevail.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|This is our home.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|The [[dracthyr]] will defend it.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|We will fight beside you, but you do not give the orders here, dragons.}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|So be it.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|Fine.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|But do try not to get in our way.}}
:{{Text|say|Wrathion|After all, I know a thing or two about vanquishing ancient adversaries.}}

Wrathion and Ebyssian have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Wrathion|Your leader does not understand the gravity of this situation.

My companion and I were summoned here by an ancient warning from... someone who was known to have world-ending aspirations.

We did not expect to find a race as yet unknown in living memory, with talents granted from all five flights.

This is concerning.}}

{{dialogue|title=Ebyssian|I apologize for my kin's lack of decorum. Wrathion is young, and often impatient.

We were drawn to this reach by a force we both felt deep inside. A warning meant to call our flight here, perhaps.

When we first observed you, we were cautious. You see, before our arrival, we did not know your kind existed.

It seems there is much you do not remember. In time, I hope your past becomes clear. But right now, we must address the danger in our midst.

The lands of the Dragon Isles are awakening, just like the dracthyr. And it seems these Primalists have come to release an ancient evil. We must stop them.}}
