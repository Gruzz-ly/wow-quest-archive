==Objectives==
Acquire weapons, armor, and supplies.
*[[Stack of Weapons]]
*[[Crate of Warscales]]
*[[Decayed Rations|Bundle of Rations]] collected

==Description==
Hostiles have invaded, our people have been confined in [[magic]]al stasis, and [[War Creche|our creche]] seems to be collapsing.

This is why we train, <name>. When in doubt, fall back to what you know.

First things first. Weapons, armor, supplies. Gather what you can find and get equipped while I marshal our forces.

Then we will locate the Earth-Warder. Surely [[Neltharion]] can provide the answers we seek.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|27|20}}
*7,900 [[XP]]
*[[Emblazoned Ruby Staff]]

==Progress==
When memory fails, fall back on your training.

==Completion==
This gear is ancient, and the food has turned to dust.

It makes no sense... those rations should have lasted a lifetime.

Well, we will make do with what we have.

==Progression==
{{The War Creche}}
