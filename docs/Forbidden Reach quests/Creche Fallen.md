==Objectives==
Collect the Horn Signet of [[Talon Tetsos|Tetsos]], Horn Signet of [[Talon Arrosh|Arrosh]], Horn Signet of [[Talon Ekrati|Ekrati]] and Horn Signet of [[Talon Hermin|Hermin]] in the [[Lost Atheneum]].
* [[Horn Signet of Tetsos]]
* [[Horn Signet of Arrosh]]
* [[Horn Signet of Ekrati]]
* [[Horn Signet of Talon Hermin]]

==Description==
This is my failure, <name>. 

I led these [[dracthyr]] here. They knew death was a possibility, but they also trusted me to be there for them.

I should have been down there, clearing the ruins, not up here trawling through books. 

<[[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] balls her fists.>

I need you to retrieve their horn signets. We need to give them honors.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 150x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +250 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +250 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Hmm? Sorry. My thoughts are... elsewhere, right now.

==Completion==
<Emberthal gives you a solemn nod.>

Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Ebyssian]]|I do not wish to be the harbinger of bad news, but [[Sundered Flame]] soldiers are patrolling the [[Forbidden Reach|Reach]].}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Across the valley, Sundered Flame soldiers are attacking the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|We must help our allies.}}

The talons are all where they were before, with dead [[Sundered Ambusher]]s nearby.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|May their names be ever remembered.}}
