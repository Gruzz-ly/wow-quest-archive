==Description==
I am heartened to see that so many escaped the [[War Creche]]. My own [[weyrn]]... was not as fortunate.

<Emberthal stands in silence for a moment.>

There are other creches throughout the [[Forbidden Reach|Reach]], filled with [[dracthyr]] in peril. Strong wings will be needed to reach them.

Focus. Remember your training. Get a feel for the wind again. You must regain your strength and fly to the other creches.

The time for rest is over.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|27|20}}
*7,900 [[XP]]

You will learn the following:
*[[Soar]]

==Completion==
You are getting the hang of this a lot faster than I was!

But then, you finished your <class> training. I was hoping to specialize as a diplomat.

==Notes==

:{{Text|Say|[[Scalecommander Azurathel]]|It is good to see you, Emberthal. But... where is your weyrn?}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Scalecommander Emberthal]]|I awakened. The rest of my dracthyr... did not.}}

;Emberthal has new gossip
:I shall seek answers after I have accounted for all of the dracthyr.

;Speaking with [[Dervishian]]
:Let us begin your flight training with coasting.

:When you begin to Soar, simply move forward as if you were gliding. The difference is that you pick up speed as you travel in the same direction.

:Try coasting through these rings I conjured. It may take a few tries to get used to.

Speaking with her automatically learns Soar, Surge Forward, Skyward Ascent, and Principles of Soaring.

;Speaking with [[Kodethi]]
:Okay! Diving is next!

:As you Soar, tip your nose down. You will pick up speed as you dive.

:Turn your nose up before hitting the ground and you will accelerate, burning off all of that energy you built up from your fall.

:See if you can hit all of these rings. Take as many tries as you need.

;Speaking with Dervishian
:When you are airborne you might have noticed that you can occasionally surge forward or ascend skyward.

:These are limited boosts that can give you that extra burst of speed or gain more airtime. Use them sparingly as you will only be able to use them so many times for each Soar.

:Try them at your leisure.
