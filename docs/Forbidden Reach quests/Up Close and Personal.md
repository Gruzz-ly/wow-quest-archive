==Objectives==
Slay a [[proto-dragon]] using the Proto-Killing Spear.
* Proto-dragon slain with [[Proto-Killing Spear]]

==Description==
The great proto-dragons are some of the fiercest creatures to roam the [[Forbidden Reach]].

Taking them down isn't easy, but we have many weapons in our arsenal.

Take this spear and harpoon. You'll need them. If you get caught in a proto-drake's maw, you'll need to fight tooth and claw with everything you've got to survive.

It isn't easy, but I know you can do this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 500x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Proto-dragons sure make the skies dangerous!

==Completion==
That's the way to do it! Nothing like being caught in the jaws of death to make you feel alive.

==Notes==
Three areas are marked on the zone map: [[Aerie Chasm]], [[Froststone Vault]], and [[Stormsunder Crater]]. Valid targets include [[Primal Frostback|primal frostbacks]], [[Primal Magmawing|magmawings]], [[Primal Stonescale|stonescales]], and [[Primal Stonetalon|stonetalons]].

Land, target a valid proto-drake, then either right-click on it or use the quest item to throw the spear. This will grapple the player to the proto-drake, who immediately catches the player and attempts to eat it like a snack. Attack normally, and use the extra action button for bonus damage:
:{{text|bossemote|The proto-dragon traps you in its jaws! Fight!}}
:{{abilities|Extra Jab|Jab the spear into the proto-dragon. Not as effective but every little bit helps.|id=398959|image=|cd=3 sec|notes=Instant.}}

Once the dragon gets down below 80% health, the player manages to escape the jaws and will ride the drake on it's back. The vehicle interface provides one ability:
:{{text|bossemote|You have the advantage! Use the spear!}}
:{{abilities|Spear|Spear the proto-dragon while you have the upper hand, inflicting 45 Physical damage.|id=398860|image=|cd=3 sec|notes=Instant.}}

Players still have access to the extra action button, so use them both on cooldown. At around 50%, the proto-dragon will snag the player again, so pick back up with normal combat abilities. Then back on the back of the proto-dragon from 25-0%:
:{{text|bossemote|The spear breaks!}}

Players will then parachute safely down to the ground.

==Progression==
