==Objectives==
Find 3 Zskera Vault Keys in the [[Forbidden Reach]] and deliver them to [[Pathfinder Tacha]].
* [[Zskera Vault Key]] (3)

==Description==
My pockets are empty. I have no more vault keys!

See if you can find any Zskera Keys, and [[Pathfinder Jeb|Jeb]] and I will see what we can find. If we pool our keys, we can open a lot of doors.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 6x [[Zskera Vault Key]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find any keys?

==Completion==
We also found some keys! I can't wait to open more doors!

==Notes==
Find an additional [[Zskera Vault Key]] or three from [[Forbidden Hoard]]s, then turn them in to Tacha to double up to six!
