You and your drakes seem to enjoy your adventures in Forbidden Reach, don't you? 

I heard the windstreams in the southern Forbidden Reach are especially good today. Why don't you try a few courses out there?

==Completion==

==Notes==
The Stormsunder Crater Circuit starts at {{co|76.1|65.6|Forbidden Reach}} on a ridge between [[Stormsunder Crater]] and [[Darksand Hollow]] in east-southeast [[Forbidden Reach]]. The Southern Reach Route starts at {{co|63.7|84.0|Forbidden Reach}} on the southeastern shore, northeast of the [[Broken Seaboard]]. Pick either (if attempting an advanced or reverse race), or both (if doing normal races).
