==Notes==
Upon accepting the quest, Emberthal will fly down below.
:{{ClassIcon|Hunter}}{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Neltharion employed many hunters. He had a great interest in beasts. I think they will find a better fate as your companion than as his experiment.}}
:{{ClassIcon|Mage}}{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Mastery of the arcane is not limited to the blue dragonflight. Your magic will show how accomplished we dracthyr can be.}}
:{{ClassIcon|Priest}}{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Your training as a priest allows you to wield both the light and shadow. Our creator had an affinity to one, you may make your own choice.}}
:{{ClassIcon|Rogue}}{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|You must be one of the stealthy agents Neltharion employed. His networks are gone, but there is always need for a cunning rogue.}}
:{{ClassIcon|Warlock}}{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|You have learned to call in beings and power from beyond Azeroth. Our creator was also well versed in the dark arts. Do not fall as he did.}}
:{{ClassIcon|Warrior}}{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|The dracthyr were intended to be an army and you would have been a warrior on the front lines. You will have to choose a new cause to fight for.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Press Jump while falling to [[Glide (racial)]].}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Seek out a member of the bronze dragonflight named Chromie. She will help you to understand what has happened while you slept.}}

Emberthal will have additional dialogue if you speak to her:
{{dialogue|
I'm glad we were able to get you out, <name>.

We haven't been so lucky in some of the other creches we've uncovered.

{{gossip|quest=|What's happened since I slept?}}}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|So much has happened while you slept. I barely know where to start.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Our master, Neltharion, is dead. His benevolence, a lie. He sought to control us. To control the world.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|He was cast down by the people he sought to  rule, people who have reached out to us in friendship.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|We are no longer a tool for destruction. We are free. Many have stayed with the Ebon Scales to reclaim our home.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Though you look as if want to see the wonders that were denied you. To chart your own path.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|The world is so much bigger than we knew. There is so much to see.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Go forth and make your weyrn proud.}}

Depending on the chosen faction, the floor below will be filled with either [[Obsidian Warder Custodian]]s or [[Dark Talon Custodian]]s, with [[Scalecommander Azurathel]] or [[Scalecommander Cindrethresh]] standing next to a portal to either [[Stormwind City]] or [[Orgrimmar]].
{{dialogue|
Welcome back, <class>.

The Obsidian Warriors/Dark Talons are working through our creches, finding our lost kin. The world you are stepping into is very different than when we slept. The Obsidian Warriors/Dark Talons are part of the Alliance/Horde now, one of the two major factions of Azeroth.

I'll let you form your own opinions, but I think you'll like them.}}

On exiting the portal:
:{{text|say|Chromie|<name>! Over here! You look like you slept through quite a bit of history. No worries, I'll get you caught up.}}
