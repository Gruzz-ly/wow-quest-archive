'''The Scary Vault of Ur''' starts the second week of [[Zskera Vaults]] quests.

==Objectives==
Enter and explore Zskera Vault: Ur.
* Speak with [[Pathfinder Jeb]] to enter the vault
* [[Vengeful Research|Secure the Vault]]
* Doors opened with [[Zskera Vault Key]]s

==Description==
[[File:Vengeful Research.jpg|thumb|[[Vengeful Research]]]]
[[Tacha]]'s big ears heard some noise in one of the tunnels. We took a peek inside. I'm not going to lie: it's grim in there. Pretty terrifying. All sorts of horrible creatures. Not the sort of thing Tacha and I usually deal with up close.

You have experience dealing with monsters, right? Excellent. You go first. Don't worry. Once it's safe, we'll come in and join you. Really, it's the least we can do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you explored the vault?

==Completion==
Good work in there. Very brave. As long as we have more keys, we'll have more to explore. 

Not all of the vaults are terrifying, of course. Deadly? Sure. Treacherous? You bet. But maybe not as terrifying. Maybe.

Keep in touch. In a few more days, we'll be ready to explore another vault.

==Notes==

On approach:
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Tacha|You are definitely wrong.}}
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Tacha|It's Vault Uuuur!}}
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|No it is Vault Urrrr... you drag out the last letter.}}
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Tacha|It's a silly name.}}

Don't forget to pick up [[Authentic Authorization]] from [[Cataloger Wulferd]] before going in.

Speak with Jeb:
:The island has many secrets beneath the surface I aim to discover them all.
:{{gossip|quest=|Let's explore Zskera Vault Ur.}}

Same layout as [[:Zskera Vault: Az]]. Down the flight of stairs, the central chamber occupied by an angry [[Vengeful Research]] water elemental, and three oozes: [[Experimental Trial]], [[Horrible Error]], and an [[Inhuman Test Subject]]. After clearing out the hostiles, open a door and turn in to stop the Vengeful Research from respawning.

The center of the room has an Obsidian Mixing Table and an Obsidian Enchanting Table. The mixing table has a [[Flask of Elastic Ooze]] on it, which allows players to jump up to higher floors (and safely slow-fall down from a jump -- don't just run off!).
