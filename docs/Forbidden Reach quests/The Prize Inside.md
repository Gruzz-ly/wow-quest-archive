==Objectives==
Defend the vault.
*[[Froststone Vault]] defended (0/100%)

==Description==
So the [[Primalists]] want what's inside this vault?

<[[Sarkareth]] narrows his eyes.>

Let them come.

We will show them what the [[dracthyr]] were born to do!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|51|48}}
*9,850 [[XP]]
*[[Emerald Tear Necklace]]

==Progress==
We are not defending a creche. We are defending something far more dangerous. I can feel it.

The [[magic]] behind that barrier is fighting to get out. Stand your ground and do NOT let these Primalists pass.

==Completion==
We are overrun! They are about to breach the vault!

Where are those [[black dragon]]s?!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|This vault holds our legacy! We will not let invaders claim it!}}

Enemies include [[Tarasek Shockbringer]]s, [[Trueborn Rainmaker]]s, [[Windscourge Dragon]]s, and [[Conjured Windfiend]]s. Heal the wounded allies: [[Mage Talon]]s, [[Azuresworn Drakonid]], [[Atrenosh Hailstone]], [[Tactical Mender]]s.

During the fighting, [[Kurog Grimtotem]] taunts.
*{{Text|say|Kurog Grimtotem|Let the storm be unleashed! At long last, she shall be free!}}
*{{Text|say|Kurog Grimtotem|You will bow before her! Before all the Incarnates!}}

;Vault defended
:{{Text|yell|Kurog Grimtotem|Enough! Take the vault! I will liberate the [[Raszageth|Storm-Eater]]!}}

;Upon completion
A [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|cinematic]] plays out:
{{#ev:youtube|9-2EVfiOGVg}}

On the other side of the cinematic:
:{{Text|say|[[Scalecommander Emberthal]]|Evoker! Get moving!}}

The ground is littered with dead dracthyr, and all around you are the Primalists, overseen by Raszageth and Kurog above.

==Progression==
{{Froststone Vault}}

==Alpha version==
{{Rfa-section|Dragonflight}}
*During the alpha, the quest was named '''There's a Prize Inside'''.
*The second sentence of the description originally mentioned "Sandovren" instead of "Sarkareth".
*[[Primal Sycophant]]s counted toward the objective.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.0.2|note=Added.}}
