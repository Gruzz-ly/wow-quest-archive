* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Notes==
Interact with [[Peikon]] near the center of the quest area, and it releases Clue Seekers all over. Go to each blue spot and use the Gain Clue extra action button to fill the bar. Also be on the look out for [[Juicy Clue]]s.

Completing this world quest adds a page to the [[Tome of Archived Isles Research]] at {{co|58.5|36.7|Thaldraszus}} in [[Nirobin]]'s office at [[Algeth'ar Academy]] in [[Thaldraszus]]:

{{book|content=Information acquired from the Concord Observatory, Waking Shores, Dragon Isles, Azeroth:

These Concord astronomers believed their telescopic contraptions gave them the ability to view the future. I cannot confirm the inventions' success as the data from the site is mostly abstraction and vague theories that would be hard to disprove.}}

After completing the world quest a second time, the page is filled in with more information:

{{book|content= ﻿However, one of their prophecies caused a panic amongst the flights. It warned of a bloody conflict and of a "traitor" that would sway its outcome.}}

After completing the world quest a third time, the page is completed:

{{book|content= Though this "traitor's prophecy" garnered them additional sponsorship from several prominent figures, notably the black dragonflight, their success was short lived, and their organization eventually collapsed.

Sadly, there's no retrievable or existing record of their process, so I cannot experiment with their methods myself.}}
