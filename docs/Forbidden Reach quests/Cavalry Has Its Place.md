==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Crimson Vorquin]]
*[[Sapphire Vorquin]]
*[[Obsidian Vorquin]]
*[[Bronze Vorquin]]

OR, if you already know all four mounts, you will receive:
*[[Dracthyr Token of Cavalry Excellence]]

You will also learn/receive:
*[[Journeyman Riding]]
*{{cost|2|52|70}}
*990 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Evoker]], this place still has herds of [[vorquin]]!

I managed to round up a few of the more agreeable creatures that could be used as [[mount]]s for when your wings are tired. Remember how to ride?

I was ordered to issue one to you as the [[scalecommander]]s are ordering you all over the place. Take good care of it.
