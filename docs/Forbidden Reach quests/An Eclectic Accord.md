Speak with the newly-arrived denizens of [[Morqut Village]].

*Speak to [[Turik]] {{co|34.2|60.0|Forbidden Reach}}
*Speak to [[Scalecommander Azurathel|Azurathel]] {{co|35.5|58.7|Forbidden Reach}}

==Description==
While the storm over [[Forbidden Reach|the Reach]] was raging, I gathered allies for our eventual return. I want to ensure they have everything they need, but I can't welcome all of them personally.

Would you be my envoy, <name>? Can you make sure they have what they need? We have few supplies to offer and a shortage of assistance. 

The least I can do is offer my gratitude. Please thank them personally on my behalf.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 350x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +250 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +250 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
I appreciate your aid. I would attend to our allies' concerns myself, but there are still many missing dracthyr.

==Completion==
I must thank you as well, <class>. Our allies have come to the Reach for many reasons. Their kindness humbles me.

Now we need to follow through and do everything we can to make this place safe and prosperous.

==Notes==
[[File:An Eclectic Accord - Tukkaraq.jpg|thumb|Tukkarak, the Morqut chieftain]]
[[Tukkaraq]], the Morqut chieftain, is immediately to the south:
:You look very, uh... large and unique! Maybe you can help us unload the boats?
Or
:By my tusks! What strange sights this land offers.
Or
:Don't mind us stranger. We only just returend, and we have a lot to rebuild.

:{{gossip|quest=|[[Scalecommander Viridia]] sent me to check on you.}}
:That Viridia! Always fretting over others before herself. You can tell her we are doing just fine. 
:The people of Morqut have always been a hardy sort. Now that we've returned to the Reach, we are excited to welcome all sorts of new and interesting people. 
:With luck, we'll also be able to hear more new and interesting stories!

[[File:An Eclectic Accord - Renown envoys.jpg|thumb|The renown envoys]]
[[Turik]], the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]] Renown envoy, is south of the main tent alongside the other major faction envoys:
:Welcome, traveler! What do you need?
:Ya know, Morqut Village was here before the storms, before [[Raszageth]] returned. The [[tuskarr]] fished here for generations. Even built that dock over there! It's sturdy!
:Then all that unpleasantness happened and the villagers had to flee. Storms tore down what they had built up. But now they have new friends and neighbors: dracthyr, Horde, and Alliance. Makes me feel all warm inside when I think about everyone sitting around the same cooking pot, sharing soup and stories.
:{{gossip|quest=|Scalecommander Viridia sent me to check on you.}}
:Oh, that's very nice of her to ask! I believe, however, we are all set here. We began our preparations the moment Viridia extended her invitation. 
:Isn't it something? Centaur, tuskarr, mortals, and dragons all united towards a common cause.
:These islands are more than a unique opportunity for us as individuals. They are a chance to strengthen our bonds as a united community. Our home is better than ever!

[[File:An Eclectic Accord - Azurathel.jpg|thumb|Azurathel and Obsidian Warders]]
[[Scalecommander Azurathel]] is to the east, near the flight master:
:Now that the storms have passed, we've got Primalists searching the island, pirates and rivals trying to grab all they can, and rebel dracthyr trying to force us off the island.
:Look, I appreciate that everyone needs a place to sleep and food to eat, but first, we need to make sure no one's going to get killed. We've got a job to do. It's time to fight.
:{{gossip|quest=|Scalecommander Viridia sent me to check on you.}}
:If Viridia has time to greet us, then things must be relatively stable for the moment. That is good.
:Do not worry about us. The Obsidian Warders are the finest, most well-disciplined warriors there are. 
:<A wry look passes over Azurathel's face.>
:Perhaps Scalecommander Cindrethresh would benefit from your aid more than I. Just a thought.

[[File:An Eclectic Accord - Cindrethresh.jpg|thumb|Cindrethresh and Dark Talons]]
[[Scalecommander Cindrethresh]] is immediately to the south of Azurathel:
:I'm worried about Viridia. She works so hard. She takes on so much, worrying about everyone's welfare.
:I know she's a strong leader, but if she seems a little overworked... could you let me know?
:{{gossip|quest=|Scalecommander Viridia sent me to check on you.}}
:Viridia is always so quick to see to others. I am glad she has someone like you present to help share her own burdens. 
:My Dark Talons are quite self-sufficient. So long as you are aiding Viridia with her tasks, that is all we can ask.
:That said, I am sure Azurathel would also appreciate a check-in. Not all dracthyr can match the might and grace of the Dark Talons.
