==Objectives==
Save 14 Overcharged Critters.
* Overcharged critters saved (14) {{co|62|27|Forbidden Reach}}

==Description==
[[File:Overcharged Flying Squirrel.jpg|thumb|Overcharged Flying Squirrel]]
I have an... odd request for you. I need help with some [[squirrel]]s. [[Primalists]] have corrupted them, and it's making them unstable!

I know just the thing to cool them off. Snow! If you could roll the creatures up in a big snowball, they would cool down as the snow melts. Ingenious, yes?

Can you help me?  I can't concentrate or finish my cataloguing, and I don't have time to write more eloquent prose. If nothing else, think of the loss to great literature!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 450x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]
* +350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

Have you, uh, rolled up those critters yet?

You make your work look so easy. I'm sure it will be... snow problem at all. 

Forgive me. It's the heat.

==Completion==
Thank you for helping me! I can finally relax for a bit.

I'll thank you by recording your deeds in my records. I might also write a character inspired by you in my next novel. I'll claim it's an original character, but we'll both secretly know it's you.

==Notes==
On the high snow-covered plain of the [[Froststone Peak]] north of [[Froststone Vault]], a bunch of [[Overcharged Flying Squirrel]]s look like they're on fire. Use a nearby Snowball to enter the vehicle interface. Run over the flying squirrels and {{wplink|Katamari Damacy|katamari}} them into a squirrel-filled snowball.

Note that aggroing the nearby [[Ice Elemental (Forbidden Reach)|ice elementals]] will knock players out of the vehicle interface, so clear them out before starting to roll the snowball.
