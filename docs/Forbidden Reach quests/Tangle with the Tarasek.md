==Objectives==
Slay 7 tarasek.
*[[Tarasek]] slain (7)

==Description==
The tarasek are unpredictable and wild. Like primordial [[drakonid]], if you will.

[[Neltharion]] considered them little more than fodder. Targets for our training. But they are cunning hunters, and deadly when encountered in packs.

Should they gain elemental power from these [[Primalists]], they will become even more dangerous.

We cannot let that happen, <name>. Thin their numbers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*7,900 [[XP]]
*[[Crimson Dracthyr Battlegear Bracers]]

==Progress==
Have you thinned the tarasek numbers?

==Completion==
Do not mourn the loss of a few tarasek.

Where there is one, scores more lurk in the shadows.

==Notes==
Kill [[Infused Tarasek]], [[Awakening Tarasek]], [[Tarasek Shockbringer]]s, [[Trueborn Rainmaker]]s, and [[Tarasek Shockshaman]].

==Progression==
{{The Ebon Scales}}
