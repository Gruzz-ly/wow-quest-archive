==Objectives==
Defeat 4 Guardians or Constructs.
*[[Conjured Guardian|Guardians]] or [[Ancient Construct|Constructs]] slain (4)

==Description==
Those constructs patrolling [[War Creche|the creche]] are not animated by the [[Deathwing|Earth-Warder]]'s [[magic]].

<[[Dervishian]] narrows her eyes.>

We cannot allow there to be enemies in our midst.

Destroy them to clear our path forward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|27|20}}
*7,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Who would dare defy the Earth-Warder in this way?

==Completion==
Those constructs were animated with [[blue dragonflight]] magic.

The Earth-Warder would never have allowed this!

==Notes==
