'''Angler's Challenge''' is a standard restocking daily quest for the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]] in the [[Forbidden Reach]].

==Objectives==
Catch or restock fish in the Dragonskull Fishing Hole.
*Catch 50 or restock 25 fish in Dragonskull Fishing Hole (0/100%) {{co|74.2|40.6|Forbidden Reach}}

==Description==
Say, have you noticed how good the fishing is around here? Dragonskull Island seems like it would have some great spots to cast a line. 

Why don't you go there and catch something for dinner? Be mindful, though. We still need to set some of our catch aside for later.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9}}
*9500 [[XP]]
*450x [[Elemental Overflow]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
*+350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]
*+350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]

==Progress==
My belly's rumbling... can't wait for those fresh fish!

==Completion==
We'll have a feast tonight, thanks to you!

==Notes==
Just south of [[Dragonskull Island]] is the Dragonskull Island Fishing Hole. The [[Reclusive Fisher]] there starts [[Dragonskull Shoal]] daily quest, which fills 80% of the bar for this quest. More fish can be turned in to the [[Daring Fisher]], who has the full set of Catch and Release dailies.

[[Aileron Seamoth School]]s, [[Cerulean Spinefish School]]s, and [[Thousandbite Pirahna Swarm]]s are also in the area should players want to catch fish instead.

==Progression==
