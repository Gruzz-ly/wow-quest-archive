'''Return to Viridia''' concludes the primary [[Forbidden Reach storyline]].

==Objectives==
Meet with [[Scalecommander Viridia|Viridia]] in [[Morqut Village]] at the [[Forbidden Reach]].

==Description==
I should entrust you to Viridia. She's working with the [[Healing Wings]] in Morqut Village to build a safe place for the [[dracthyr]], the [[tuskarr]], and our other allies in the Reach.

We have a home here... and I... I have some thinking to do. I'm grateful that you walked beside me through this trial.

This isn't over. But at least I know that the next time we face [[Sarkareth]], we can count on you. Thank you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +75 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +75 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Completion==
Welcome back, <name>. I can tell from the look on your face that wasn't easy.

I'm not looking forward to dealing with Sarkareth again, but we'll be ready next time. For now, we have more pressing matters at hand. We won't be done until we've made the Reach safe for everyone.

==Notes==
On accept, an [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:

:''Emberthal and Ebyssian are standing where Sarkareth was hovering.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|If you were to follow him... what would you do?}}
:{{text|say|Emberthal|Extinguish my enemy. As I was trained to.}}
:''Ebyssian grunts.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|By Neltharion.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|But this time, the "enemy" is one of your own, as are the dracthyr that follow him.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Soldiers who, like you, were conditioned to claim victory at any cost.}}
:''Upset at this, Emberthal turns around to look at Ebyssian and points an accusatory finger at him.''
:{{text|say|Emberthal|How dare you presume to know us?}}
:{{text|say|Emberthal|You, who hid among mortals while other dragons fought and died to protect our world!}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|You are right. I was content to be simply "Ebonhorn," and Highmountain was my home.}}
:''Ebyssian sighs.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I should have done more.}}
:{{text|say|Emberthal|Why didn't you?}}
:''Ebyssian sucks in a breath.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Because I too am Neltharion's offspring, and it brought me only shame.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I came here to face that, and found you.}}
:''Emberthal lets out a big sigh.''
:{{text|say|Emberthal|You must be disappointed.}}
:''Ebyssian chuckles.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|No. Just now, you defied his voice inside you.}}
:''Emberthal turns to look Ebyssian in the eye at this.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Chose compassion over violence.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Our family does not have to live in his shadow.}}
:{{text|say|Emberthal|Family.}}
:''She turns away from Ebyssian again.''
:{{text|say|Emberthal|When I awoke... they were gone... all of them.}}
:{{text|say|Emberthal|For the first time, I was alone. And it terrified me.}}
:{{text|say|Emberthal|And when Sarkareth killed the others...}}
:''Emberthal clinches her fist as her rage builds, but Ebyssian puts a hand on her shoulder and she turns to look at him again.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Emberthal.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|He will face justice for what he has done.}}
:{{text|say|Emberthal|Will you help me, Ebyssian?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|We... will help each other.}}
