==Objectives==
Assume your mortal [[visage]].
*Speak to [[Wrathion]]
*Learn about visage form
*Assume your mortal visage

==Description==
You turned every head in [[Stormwind]] with your arrival, <name>. No doubt some citizens were more... amenable to your presence than others.

In order to better commune with other [[race]]s, we [[dragon]]s adopt a mortal visage, like the one you see before you. Not only does it put allies at ease, but it makes passing through doorways considerably less disruptive.

Clearly the essence of [[dragonkin]]d flows through the [[dracthyr]]. I suspect you may share our ability to assume a visage.

Walk with me.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast upon you:
*[[Visage (racial)]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*7,900 [[XP]]
*[[Gilded Dracthyr's Tabard]]

==Progress==
Mortals can be so nervous around superior beings.

==Completion==
Your visage suits you well, <name>. It is unlike any I have seen before!

Perhaps when we learn more of your origins, we will understand why the dracthyr visage differs from that of a dragon.

But now, we have an expedition to prepare for.

==Notes==
;Speaking to Wrathion
:Choosing a visage is an important decision for a dragon.

:It should be no less meaningful for a [[dracthyr]].

:Needless to say, I am happy to share my expertise.

:{{Gossip|<Ask about choosing a visage.>}}

:{{text|say|Wrathion|A visage is an expression of how you want to be seen by others. Will you be friendly and approachable, or stern and intimidating?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Certain of my kin chose the latter. As for myself, I settled on dashing and perilously handsome.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|The magic is within you, <name>. Look inside and focus on a form that reflects how you want the world to see you.}}

An [[Extra Action Button]] appears on-screen, allowing you to cast {{Abilities|Visage Form|id=382916|icon=ability_racial_visage}}. Press it:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Yes, that's it! The visage lies within you!}}

Once the cast completes, you assume your visage form and learn the [[Visage (racial)]] and [[Chosen Identity]] spells.
