==Objectives==
Slay 4 scythid.
*[[Scythid]] slain (4)

==Description==
The wilds surrounding this creche are home to scythid. They are voracious [[insectoid]]s, often territorial and aggressive.

All these wounded would be easy prey for those beasts. I do not want them attacking our Menders while they recover.

Cull their numbers while I look after [[Scalecommander Viridia|Viridia]].

She is.. very brave.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|50|60}}
*7,900 [[XP]]
*[[Crimson Dracthyr Battlegear Belt]]

==Progress==
The menders do not need any more stress.

==Completion==
The scythid were always formidable, but it seems during our stasis they have grown even larger and more threatening.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|You should lie down, Viridia. You need to rest.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|Nonsense. I am perfectly <cough> fine. Just... hurry back with those toxin glands, evoker. <cough>}}

Kill [[Scythid Steamstalker]]s and [[Deatheater Scythid]]s.

==Progression==
