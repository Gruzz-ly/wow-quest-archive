==Objectives==
Follow Cindrethresh to find [[Viridia|Scalecommander Viridia]].
*Follow [[Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Cindrethresh]]
*Speak with Viridia.

==Description==
Whatever toxin has infested this creche is potent enough to take down our best [[healer]]s.

That does not bode well for either one of us, <name>.

No matter. [[Dracthyr]] are trapped inside. We are going in, regardless of risk.

Take a deep breath and follow me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|27|20}}
*7,900 [[XP]]
*[[Crimson Dracthyr Battlegear Hauberk]]

==Completion==
Good. You are awake.

<Viridia coughs to clear her throat.>

We need an evoker's skills right now.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Viridia! Viridia? Are you here?}}
:''Cindrethresh enters the [[Support Creche]].''

Entering the cave gives the player Choking debuff and bar. Continue until the bar fills and the character chokes which completes the objective.

:''The player and Cindrethresh wake up outside, tended to by Viridia.''
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|Easy there, Cindre. Easy.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Vir... <cough>  I... we went in after you.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|Shhhh. I know. You are as brave and foolish as ever.}}
