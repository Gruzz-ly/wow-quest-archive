==Objectives==
Choose a [[specialization]].
*Activate a Talent Spec

==Description==
If what these dragons say is true, then a great battle is upon us. We need you focused and strong, evoker.

Time to choose your battle specialization. Will you preserve your allies, or devastate your enemies? 

To hone your combat skills to their sharpest, choose Devastation.

To maximize your healing potential, take the path of Preservation.

To enhance your wingmates, embrace Augmentation.

Each specialization should serve you well. And remember, you can change or adapt it later.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|57|40}}
*990 [[XP]]
*[[Crimson Dracthyr Battlegear Leggings]]

==Progress==
Evoker?

==Completion==
Excellent choice.

Remember, you can reconsider your specialization and adjust [[Ability|abilities]] as needed--so long as you are not in the heat of battle.

==Notes==
On accept, a window pops up:

What specialization will you choose?

;Devastation
:Devastation is a specialization in magic and tactics that involve rapid deployment, mid-ranged area of effect damage, and unleashing the power of the Red and Blue dragonflights.
:With this specialization, an Evoker can rain fire down from the sky on swarms of opponents and manuever{{sic}} throughout the battlefield.
:Choosing Devastation grants [[Pyre]] as well as [[Mastery: Giantkiller]].
;Preservation
:Preservation is a specialization devoted to protecting life. Evokers can quickly dash to injured allies and release powerful area of effect healing.
:Wield the power of the Emerald Dream to bathe allies in revitalizing energy and the Bronze sands of time to prevent harm, replicate healing, and even rewind injuries.
:Choosing Preservation grants [[Dream Breath]] as well as [[Mastery: Life-Binder]].
;Augmentation
:Augmentation is a damage dealing specialization that uses the essence of the Black and Bronze dragonflights to amplify the abilities of nearby allies.
:With this specialization, an Evoker will empower and enhance the core strengths of their allies and in doing so, become a force to be reckoned with by any foe.
:Choosing Augmentation grants [[Ebon Might]] as well as [[Eruption]].

In case the window is closed, speak with Emberthal again:
