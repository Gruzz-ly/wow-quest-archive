[[File:Stuck in Stasis.jpg|thumb|Primalists and an Imprisoned Dracthyr]]

==Objectives==
Free [[dracthyr]] trapped in stasis within [[Froststone Vault]].
* Healing Wing recruited (Optional) {{co|34.5|57.4|Forbidden Reach}}
* Imprisoned Dracthyr freed (6)
* Ice Primalists slain (10)

==Description==
[[File:Imprisoned Dracthyr.jpg|thumb|upright|Imprisoned Dracthyr]]
When the first dracthyr awakened from millennia of slumber, we left the [[Forbidden Reach]] for the [[Dragon Isles]]. Yet not all of the dracthyr are free. Some are still in stasis, hidden deep within their creches.

We need your help. Travel to Froststone Vault. See if you can find more of our friends. One of my Healing Wings would be glad to accompany you. Choose someone who best suits your need.

It is time for all dracthyr to rejoin the world as we have.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 350x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Have you found more hidden dracthyr?

==Completion==
It warms my heart to see so many new arrivals. We will do our best to orient them on all the changes in the world since they were last awake.

Thank you, friend.

==Notes==
A dracthyr stoneclaw and mender are just north of Viridia. The stoneclaw will tank:
:I'm ready to stand between you and anything that wants to eat your face.
:{{gossip|Come with me to the Froststone Vault.}}
:{{text|say|Dracthyr Stoneclaw|Finally, some action!}}

The mender will heal:
:Need some healing?
:{{gossip|Come with me to the Froststone Vault.}}
:{{text|say|Dracthyr Mender|Meet you there!}}

Pick either, or not, then head to [[Froststone Vault]] and defeat [[Primalist Hailcrasher|Primalist hailcrashers]], [[Primalist Frostslinger|frostslingers]] and their [[Ice Elemental (Forbidden Reach)|ice elementals]], and elite [[Tarasek Frostclaw|tarasek frostclaws]], while freeing [[Imprisoned Dracthyr|imprisoned dracthyr]]. The freed dracthyr will briefly help fight alongside the selected NPC from earlier.

Freed dracthyr say one of:
*{{text|say|Freed Dracthyr|Freed! I could never have dreamt this!}}
*{{text|say|Freed Dracthyr|Run... if Neltharion see's{{sic}} us, we will be back in stasis!}}
*{{text|say|Freed Dracthyr|There are no words that can express this feeling!}}
*{{text|say|Freed Dracthyr|Whoever you are... thank you!}}
*{{text|say|Freed Dracthyr|I am in debt to you!}}
*{{text|say|Freed Dracthyr|So many years...freedom at last!}}
