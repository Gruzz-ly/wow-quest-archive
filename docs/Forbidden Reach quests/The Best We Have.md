==Objectives==
Talk with [[Talon Damos]].
* Give Talon Damos his orders

==Description==
I am glad you're here, <name>. 

The storms have cleared and the creches are open. Now is the time to strike! I'm leading a team of scouts further into the Reach.

When you're ready to depart, speak with Talon Damos. He's acting as my second-in-command. The [[dracthyr]] he leads will be accompanying us on our next reconnaissance mission.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 150x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +150 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +150 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Completion==
You're here.

Good.

==Notes==
[[Scalecommander Emberthal]] offers a skip for alts who have already done the [[Forbidden Reach storyline]].
:{{gossip|I know my way around. {{text|red|<Skip campaign quests, forfeit their rewards, and continue adventuring the Forbidden Reach.>}}}}
:* This will allow players to jump to [[Return to Viridia]], and will {{text|red|forfeit}} the following:
:** 1550 [[Elemental Overflow]]
:** 1575 [[Valdrakken Accord]] reputation
:** 1725 [[Dark Talons]] (Horde) or [[Obsidian Warders]] (Alliance) reputation.
On accept:
:''Damos flies in.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Well met, Damos. It's good to see an old friend.}}
:{{text|say|Talon Damos|It's an honor to serve by your side once again, Scalecommander.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Talon Damos will be my second-in-command for this mission. He's a fine soldier. One of the best.}}

Speak with Damos:
:Good to see you, soldier. Up for a game of dice to pass the time?
:First things first. We've got to go on patrol.
*{{gossip|Why are you helping Emberthal?}}
:Good soldiers are hard to come by. Good commanders? Even more so. I'd follow Emberthal into any fight. And I'm ready for the next one.
:Plus, I've had my fun taking an... extended leave of absence in [[Valdrakken]]. I'm itching for some action.
:Old habits die hard, I suppose.
*{{gossip|quest=|Let's fly.}}
:{{text|say|Talon Damos|We're going back into the Reach. That place was our prison for ten thousand years. It's time we made it our home.}}
:{{text|say|Talon Damos|Talons! To the skies!}}
:''The talons nearby walk up and fly away with Damos.''

Head to the [[Lost Atheneum]] to catch up with them.
