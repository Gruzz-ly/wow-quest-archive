'''One Dragon's Junk''' begins the "Verbal Archaeology" storyline of the [[Zskera Vaults]] and the [[Forbidden Reach]].

==Objectives==
Locate an object for Voraxian within the [[Zskera Vaults]].
*[[Odd Device|Locate an object for Voraxian within the Zskera Vaults]] {{co|28.9|56.9|Forbidden Reach}}

==Description==
Greetings! I am looking for items of power from my flight's past. 

We have a history of great warriors and battle prowess, and I want to recover items that will help us reach that again.

I heard you found these vaults. If you see anything of interest inside, could you show it to me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything interesting?

==Completion==
Oh, this is... definitely something?

It does not seem like it could be used as a weapon, but I suppose it is worth investigating. You never know.

==Notes==
After entering the vault on [[Zskera Vault: Az]], find the [[Odd Device]] on a crate in the southwest portion of the main chamber.

==Progression==
{{Verbal Archaeology}}
