==Objectives==
Prepare to leave [[War Creche|the creche]].
*Glide into the [[Earth-Warder's Cauldron]]
*[[Dracthyr Talon|Dracthyr]] rescued or healed with [[:Living Flame]] (5)

==Description==
Your skills are needed, [[evoker]].

The creche is crumbling and we have few supplies. We must reach the passage out, but we have to get past this [[arcane]] barrier first.

In the chamber beyond, there are [[dracthyr]] in need of aid. Tend their wounds. Destroy any foe who stands in your way.

This may be the last time we walk these halls together, <name>. Make it count.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|50|54|40}}
*9,850 [[XP]]
*[[Crimson Dracthyr's Drape]]

==Completion==
You healed our people. Well Done.

Now to deal with that dragon.

:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|Only fragments. A battle against a great foe. We claimed victory... I think. Though I fear we paid a terrible price for it.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|We will find answers. But first, we need to get our people out of here.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|By wing or by talon, we will see it done.}}

Use [[Living Flame]] on [[Dracthyr Talon]]s. Many are attacked by [[Drakonid Crechebound]].
