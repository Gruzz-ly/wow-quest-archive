'''Filming the Caldera''' is a standard cataloging World Quest for the [[Dragonscale Expedition]], but in daily quest form.

==Objectives==
Fly over the [[Caldera of the Menders]] and capture local wildlife on your camera.
*Ride the [[Cataloger's Gyrocopter]]
*Take Pictures of Wildlife (0/100%)

==Description==
The arthropods in Caldera of the Menders are truly vicious. One of our [[gyrocopter]]s went missing there!

Our expedition sent a{{sic}} unmanned surveillance aircraft there, but it hasn't returned. Can you find the gyrocopter? You could use it to capture the Caldera's wildlife on camera?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9}}
*9500 [[XP]]
*450x [[Elemental Overflow]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]
*+350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]
*+350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]

==Progress==
Spotted anything interesting down there?

==Completion==
Well done! Extensive photography makes our documentation complete!

==Notes==
The [[Cataloger's Gyrocopter]] and the [[Dragonscale Gyrocopter Pilot]] are on the platform outside the entrance to the [[Support Creche]],{{co|42.8|35.4|Forbidden Reach}} seemingly none the worse for wear. The pilot has this to say:
:Howdy! Oh, Daela sent you to find me? Aw, how nice of her.
:A huuuuge beetle hit my rotor as I was busy taking pictures of the scythids down there... The bug was shredded to pieces, but I had to make an emergency landing for some repairs. Cleaning the mess took almost as long as the fixing.
:Say, since you're here, why don't you want to take a ride and take the pictures of those obnoxious bugs instead of me?
