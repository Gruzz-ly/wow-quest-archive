==Objectives==
Slay 12 Conjured elementals.
*[[Conjured Stormling|Conjured elementals]] slain (12)
*Meet [[Azurathel]] at [[Stormsunder Crater]].

==Description==
These [[Primalists]] are summoning an army of [[elemental]]s. We have to assume they mean to unleash them against our forces.

Well, not on our watch.

Rain fire upon them, evoker! Burn those elementals from the [[Forbidden Reach|Reach]], and take out their [[conjurer]]s before they summon more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*7,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Where are they drawing all of this power from? And to what end?

==Completion==
Conjured elementals may not be the most satisfying foe, but it does feel good to stretch our wings again.

==Progression==
{{The Ebon Scales}}
