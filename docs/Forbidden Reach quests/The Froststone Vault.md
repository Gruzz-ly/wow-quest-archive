==Objectives==
Rally to [[Froststone Vault]].
*Report to [[Scalecommander Sarkareth]] at Froststone Vault.

==Description==
Look there, across the Reach! [[Primalist]] forces are converging on Froststone Vault.

The storm they seek to unleash must be locked inside.

<Emberthal winces, wrestling with her broken memories.>

We fought this enemy before, and won. [[Neltharion]] commanded that the vault be secured, but I... cannot remember why...

This is no time for contemplation. Rally with Sarkareth and the [[Ebon Scales]] at the vault. Ensure the enemy does not breach it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|12|87}}
*3,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Steady there, <class>. The Ebon Scales will put an end to this incursion.
