Talk to [[Veritistrasz]].

*Talk to Veritistrasz {{co|85.6|35.0|Ohn'ahran Plains}}

==Description==
Where should we meet this Veritistrasz of yours?

[[Ruby Lifeshrine]]? Are you sure this is not an attempt to introduce me to [[Alexstrasza]]? 

No? Well then! I shall meet you at the Ruby Lifeshrine!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Let us hope this is something exciting!

==Completion==
[[File:Verbal Archaeology - the view.jpg|thumb|Voraxian and Veritistrasz's view]]
Well, that is a bit of a disappointment.

I suppose an old egg-tending device is some form of culture, even if it is not very exciting. 

If you find something else of interest in the vaults, I would be interested in looking at it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Voraxian|I will meet you at the Ruby Lifeshrine. Please be swift, I do not want to be there long.}}
:''Voraxian walks off.''

Head back to the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]] and get to Veritistrasz's usual spot overlooking the valley to the north. Voraxian is already there, but Veritistrasz is not:
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Do not mind me friends. Nothing to see here. I grew up in Outland, and I was not involved in any Deathwing related activities.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|I do not see your friend here. I will leave and catch up once you find out where they went.}}
:''Voraxian shifts to his drake form and flies off.''

Speak with [[Tzurok]] near [[Haephesta]] and [[Vaknai]], the flight master:
:Pleasant day to you.
:{{gossip|quest=|<Ask where Veritistrasz is>}}
:{{text|say|Tzurok|The old dragon who sat by the ledge? He took off a while ago and headed south.}}

Fly basically due south to [[Rusza'thar Reach]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]] where [[Veritistrasz]] is up on a tower.
:''Voraxian flies in and shifts to his visage form.''

Speak with Veritistrasz again:
:Helllo{{sic}} <name>, nice to see you again. 
:I went to [[Valdrakken]] to find [[Ebyssian]], but it turns out he had already left, so I came here for the view instead. 
:Do you want to stay a while?
:{{gossip|quest=|Veritistrasz, this is Voraxian. He is a friend. Can you help us identify an artifact?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|I would be happy to have a look for you.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Thank you! It is quite exciting, you see here, clear black dragon design, and it was in Neltharion's vault so likely very old!}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Hmm. This is surprising, I have not seen one of these in thousands of years.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|What is it? Is it a weapon? Is it an ancient artifact that will help my flight defend dragonkind?}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|It is an egg tending device.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Incredible! We will be able to tap into the ancient knowledge's and utilize it to help our whelps grow!}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Oh... no, this is obsolete. We had even moved away from using this before we left the Dragon Isles. We have much better tools for it now.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Oh... Well, it is still a piece of history I guess. How did it work?}}
:{{text|emote|Vertistrasz sighs}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|I will show you if you promise to slow down.}}

Voraxian has gossip after completing the quest:
:I will stay here with Veritistrasz, he has some interesting stories.
:I suppose it is a nice view, if you like that sort of thing.

Continue exploring the [[Zskera Vaults]] for an [[Odd Round Object]], which starts the next quest in the chain: [[An Odd Round Object]].
