# Dracthyr starting experience

[[File:VZ-Dracthyr, Awaken.jpg|thumb|Forbidden Reach zone map]]
The '''[[dracthyr (playable)|dracthyr]] starting experience''' takes place in an [[instance]]d version of the [[Forbidden Reach]] zone, and introduces the playable race/[[hero class]] combo dracthyr [[evoker]], starting at level 10 (originally 58). Non-evoker dracthyr also start in the Forbidden Reach, but have a [[#Other classes|drastically shortened storyline]] that sends them to their faction capital after just a couple minutes.

The Forbidden Reach itself is an island located off the coast of the [[Dragon Isles]] that was fashioned by [[Deathwing|Neltharion]] the Earth-Warder to serve as a training ground for his ultimate soldiers, the [[dracthyr]]. But in the aftermath of a terrible battle, the island has lain dormant and abandoned for ages until the return of an ancient enemy causes the dracthyr to stir.

==Introduction==
Players are first introduced via an animated cutscene, which depicts flashbacks of their last memories.

:''Shadows envelop your vision as you fall into stasis.''

==Evoker==
The dracthyr evoker starting storyline begins on the Forbidden Reach with them awakening from a millennia-long slumber. They first encounter [[blue dragonflight]] forces guarding their unstable [[War Creche]] to prevent their escape. After breaking free and rescuing the [[Healing Wings]] and [[Ebon Scales]] from their own collapsing chambers, they meet [[Wrathion]] and [[Ebyssian]], drawn to investigate the same disturbance that roused the dracthyr. They discover the [[Primalists]] attacking the island, who are ultimately successful at freeing [[Raszageth]], who summons a powerful elemental storm. [[Nozdormu]] aids the bulk of the dracthyr in fleeing the island to join with the Alliance and Horde and bring them to the [[Dragon Isles]], kicking off the main [[Dragonflight campaign]].

Throughout this experience, various [[Racial trait|dracthyr]] and [[evoker]] abilities are introduced through quests. These include the new mechanics of [[empower]]ed spells ([[Fire Breath]]) and [[skyriding]] ([[Soar]]), as well as signature racial features like [[Glide (racial)]] and [[Visage (racial)]]. The questline is tracked in the achievement [[Dracthyr, Awaken]].

==Other classes==
Dracthyr class selection was limited to evokers in {{expac|Dragonflight}}, but expanded afterward. Non-evokers start with the same cutscene as the others, but do not follow the original Forbidden Reach storyline, which took place while the [[War Creche]] was under siege by [[primalists]] prior to most of the events of ''Dragonflight''. Instead, their awakening seems to take place later, as dracthyr leaders search for more survivors in the creche under calmer circumstances. The questline connects the dracthyr backstory with their new role as adventurers, and sends new characters on to [[Stormwind]] or [[Orgrimmar]] after just a few minutes. It provides no introduction to class abilities as the evoker storyline does.
