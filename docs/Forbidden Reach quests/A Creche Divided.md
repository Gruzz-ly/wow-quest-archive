==Description==
This place... I have not been here for a long time. Not since before I was a [[Scalecommander]]. 

It is a dark place, full of pain... and failure. 

This was where [[Neltharion]] tested those he considered most worthy of his attention. He poked and prodded us with powers we could not understand or control.

Many of us were found... wanting.

Perhaps [[Sarkareth]] brought me here to test me the same way our father tested us.

Will you walk with me?

You will receive:
* [[Cloak of Dark Descent]]
* [[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]] (150x [[Dragon Isles Supplies]])
* 200x [[Elemental Overflow]]

* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +250 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +250 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Completion==
We have him cornered! 

They aren't attacking... why? What trick is this?

==Notes==
On accept, [[Emberthal]] joins the player. She also has new gossip:
:The suffering in this place was... unimaginable. 
:I would not wish it upon my worst enemies. Not even Sarkareth.

Enter the cave:
:{{text|say|[[Scalecommander Sarkareth]]|Here we are... at long last.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Sarkareth! You'll pay for the dracthyr blood you've spilled!}}

Consider interacting with Forbidden Memoirs in the cave:
:{{text|say|Memory of Neltharion|Hear now the words of the Earth Warder. The voice of your creator.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I remember this place. Neltharion told us it would hone our minds.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|We marched through these caves for hours. Days.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|The echoes of his voice overwhelmed everything... even our own thoughts.}}

Defeat Elarthresh:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Here, we culled the weak from our ranks. The unworthy perished.}}

Randomly:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Have you forgotten this place? The lessons Neltharion taught us?}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I remember. But we will never find our future until we let go of the past! There is nothing for us here.}}

Abereth:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|The power in these caves is timeless. As is the failure of those whose bones litter its floor.}}

Haerothal:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Look upon the fallen! See their weakness, as I see yours.}}

Randomly:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|This is our inheritance. The strength that Neltharion gave us... the power that is ours by right!}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Yet you would throw it all away.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|He betrayed us! He betrayed the [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]]! He betrayed [[Azeroth]]!}}

Memoire 2:
:{{text|say|Memory of Neltharion|You are my talons, honed to strike at the very hearts of my enemies.}}
:{{text|say|Memory of Neltharion|That is your purpose... the destiny that lies before you.}}
:{{text|say|Memory of Neltharion|Your obedience, your loyalty, must never falter.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|No. Your legacy is nothing but death!}}

Memoire 3:
:{{text|say|Memory of Neltharion|Deep within the halls of [[Aberrus]], I forged you. My ideal soldiers. My [[dracthyr]].}}
:{{text|say|Memory of Neltharion|Bound by unfaltering unity to fight the wars others could not.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|He was our general once. He trained us. Watched over us.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|What changed? When did we become mere tools to be discarded?}}

Memoire 4:
:{{text|say|Memory of Neltharion|My legacy lies deep within the earth. In the darkness, you will find strength.}}
:{{text|say|Memory of Neltharion|Serve my will, and one day the world will tremble before your might.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I... I need to leave this place. Before I lose myself to the darkness.}}

Randomly:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|The Earth Warder had the strength to see his vision made manifest. I will claim that strength and use it to lead our people to victory!}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|You do not seek to lead. You seek to dominate. Just like Neltharion before you.}}

[[File:A Creche Divided - after.jpg|thumb|Sarkareth and Sundered Flame]]
Outside the other entrance to the cave, Sarkareth has a whole squad of [[Sundered Fanatic]]s kneeling before him.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Do you see now, Emberthal? We are Neltharion's ultimate vision. His masterpiece.}}
:''Ebyssian flies in.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Yet you would throw dracthyr lives away for power? What could we be owed that demands so bloody a price?}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Purpose, Emberthal. We are owed a purpose.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Neltharion's secrets are hidden somewhere in the Dragon Isles. And when I find them, his legacy will be mine.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I won't let you lead our people to ruin, Sarkareth.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Emberthal...}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|You would heed the command of a dragon rather than face me in battle? Pitiful! You have forgotten what it means to be dracthyr.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I... I don't want to fight you.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Better that your soldiers died in stasis rather than live to see what you've become. Stay here with your new master. Follow me, and I will end you.}}
:''Sarkareth and the Sundered Flame fly away.''

Ebyssian has gossip:
:Sarkareth knew Emberthal would stay her hand... our hands. But it was not her weakness he exploited.
:It was her strength. Her compassion.
:Emberthal's loyalty to her people--all her people--is an inspiration to us all.
:And it is something Sarkareth fears.

As does Emberthal:
:I... could not do it. There were too many. Too many dracthyr between Sarkareth and myself. 
:I am not like him. I cannot cut a swath of destruction through our own people.
