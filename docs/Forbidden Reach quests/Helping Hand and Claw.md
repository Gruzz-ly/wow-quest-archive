==Description==
Members of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]] traveled here to help explore ruins on [[Morqut Islet|this island]]. Their efforts may help us uncover more details about our past.

==Progress==
Is it safe to travel to [[Morqut Village]]?

==Completion==
With your help, Jeb and I are safe. And our supplies are safe, too!

A tuskarr fisherman has agreed to give us a lift to Morqut Village. We hope to see you there soon.

==Notes==

Approach Wulferd and Jeb due south on the [[Sharpscale Coast]] of the mainland:
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|Well, we finally found the one situation I didn't prepare for.}}
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Tacha|Next time, I'm driving the boat...}}
:{{text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|This is most embarrassing for both of you, but it makes for great photographs!}}
:{{text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|Now struggle more! These photos must show the dangers of the Forbidden Reach!}}
:{{text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|What a great picture!}}
:{{text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|Hold still! One more picture!}}

Tacha's trapped under some shipwreck debris:
:{{text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|A brave hero saves the day!}}
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Tacha|Giant boat eating crabs! I'll take the safe sands of Vol'dun any day.}}

Jeb's in the water, caught in seaweed:
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to anyone.}}

Then collect six floating barrels and sunken crates of [[Scattered Supplies]] just offshore.

Before finishing the quest, defeat [[Karkinus the Capsizer]] to the south for the bonus objective [[Capsize a Crab]] for some bonus gold and reputation:
:{{text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|<Name> defeats the monstrosity that destroyed our boat. A great photo!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Tacha|We should be fine from here.  Meet you at Morqut Village.}}
:''All three run off to the north, disappearing in the distance.''

Return to the village where Viridia offers the next quest, [[Exploring Our Past]].
