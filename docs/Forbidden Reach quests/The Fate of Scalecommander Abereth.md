==Objectives==
Locate the three attunement relics.
* Recover the Attunement Relics (0/100%)
* [[Technoscryers]] (provided)

==Description==
According to our colleagues, this cave was used to test prospective [[scalecommander]]s.

Excuse me. It either tested them or housed their remains. The trials were so difficult that it usually amounted to the same thing.

We're searching for an ancient scalecommander referenced in our records as "The Cleaving Blade": a promising young [[dracthyr]] whose future ended abruptly somewhere near this cave. Perhaps we'll discover how their story ends.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Progress==
Without those attunement relics we won't be able to solve this mystery, <name>.

==Completion==
Ah ha! Give them here and I'll calibrate your goggles.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Zenata|Put on your goggles and activate the Scrying mode to start the search.}}

Use the provided [[Technoscryers]], then hit #1 Scrying Mode to continue.

Enter the cave and follow the path.

To the west at {{co|29.3|29.9|Dragonskull Island}} on the lower level is [[Failed Scalecommander Abereth]] and the [[Drakonid Spyglass]]:

To the north at {{co|69.4|22.5|Dragonskull Island}} on the bottom level is [[Failed Scalecommander Haerothal]] and the [[Pitted Blade]]:

:{{text|say|Failed Scalecommander Haerothal|I will claim victory!}}

To the southeast at {{co|70.7|71.5|Dragonskull Island}} is the [[Drakonid Blade]].
