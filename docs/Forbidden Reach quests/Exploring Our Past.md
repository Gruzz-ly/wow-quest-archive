==Objectives==
Meet [[Pathfinder Jeb|Jeb]] and [[Tacha]] at the entrance to the [[Zskera Vaults]].

==Description==
With your help, we can now delve deeper into the secrets of this land.

Nearby lay the Zskera Vaults. Within these large underground chambers, [[Neltharion]] stored various treasures and forgotten research. Exploring these vaults would be most beneficial.

Please travel with Tacha and Jeb and assist them as needed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|80|90}}

*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Completion==
Behind these massive doors lies a multitude of chambers to explore. Are you ready <name>?

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|I appreciate you doing this. Just... be careful. The Reach holds many secrets, some more dangerous than others.}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|Nice to have you along with us, <name>.}}
:''Tacha poses.''
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Tarcha|Photo moment!}}
:{{text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|More photos... wait for me!}}
:''All three run off to the northwest.''

Head counterclockwise around the island to the northwest to find [[Pathfinder Jeb]], [[Pathfinder Tacha]], [[Cataloger Wulferd]], and [[Voraxian]] outside the [[Zskera Vaults]]:

At the vaults, [[Cataloger Wulferd]] will sometimes pipe in with some dialogue while taking photos:
:{{text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|Show me your weapons. The folks back home love to see swords and axes!}}
:{{text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|All of us are going to be famous!}}
:{{text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|Hold still! One more picture!}}
:{{text|say|Cataloger Wulferd|Nice, I want to take a picture of that! Okay, now pretend you're planning a strategy...}}
