Kill beetles in the [[Caldera of the Menders]].
* [[Dragonbane Beetle]] slain (24)
* [[Pestilent Pincher]] slain {{co|41.0|35.7|Forbidden Reach}}

==Description==
The [[Healing Wings]] need access to our support creche, but it's still overflowing with an infestation of toxic beetles.

I'm sure [[Scalecommander Viridia|Viridia]] would appreciate it if we helped exterminate those pests.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 350x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Have you exterminated those pests?

==Completion==
We're clearing out that infestation, day by day. Every bit helps. Only a matter of time until those beetles are gone forever!

==Notes==
The [[Pestilent Pincher]] spawns on the big ledge outside the [[Support Creche]] above the [[Caldera of the Menders]]. Other beetles are all over the area.
