==Description==
Jumping through hoops is helpful to get your bearings, but we train like we fight--relentlessly.

Go ahead and try Soaring around the area until you feel you have mastered the technique. Of course you must be mindful of the local wildlife and keep an eye out for any potential threats. That is why we practice, after all.

Report back to [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] when you feel you are ready. Good luck!
