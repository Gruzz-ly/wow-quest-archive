==Objectives==
Search [[Hornswog|hornswog]] treasure piles for [[Neltharion]] agent items.
*[[Neltharion Agent Instructions]]

==Description==
Catching him at the very moment he's alone? They must've been watching somewhere nearby but just out of sight. Can you check that cave across the water? 

Those hornswogs are known hoarders. If those [[drakonid]] left something behind, it may still be there.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
:{{abilities|Azerothian Archives: Dragonskull Island, Forbidden Reach Site|Unlock the Azerothian Archives' World Quests on Dragonskull Island of the Forbidden Reach.}}
You will receive:
* {{Cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you check that cave?

==Completion==
What did you find?

==Notes==
Fly southwest to the [[Hornswog Grounds]] and the [[Hoard of Shimmermaw]]. Interact with [[Drakonid Scroll Case]]s in gold piles until the [[Neltharion Agent Instructions]] turn up. You will also find [[Paper Scraps]]. The instructions read:

{{book|content=
Eliminate any [[dracthyr]] aspirants before they can complete the trials. Not even [[Black dragonflight|my own dragonflight]] is exempt.

Let nothing stand in the way of my creation!

-N
}}

Upon completion:
:{{text|say|Zenata|Neltharion sent agents to eliminate dracthyr leadership? To what end?}}
:{{text|say|Zenata|I don't know what this "creation" was, but anything borne from Neltharion's dark intentions is worthy of more investigation.}}
