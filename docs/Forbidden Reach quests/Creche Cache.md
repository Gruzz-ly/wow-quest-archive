==Objectives==
Collect 6 Mender Supplies in the [[Support Creche]].
* Enter the Support Creche
* [[Mender Supplies]] (6)
* [[Toxin Antidote]] (provided)

==Description==
I'm glad you're here. Beetles infected our support creche, so we evacuated in a hurry. That meant leaving a lot of supplies behind.

Now we've got a lot of injured explorers, and we could sure use those supplies. Can you help us?

We need you to retrieve as many as you can. Just don't let the toxins get to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 450x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Hey, have you retrieved those supplies?

==Completion==
Thank the Aspects! These supplies will go a long way to getting us back on our feet. Thank you.

==Notes==
Enter the [[Support Creche]] of [[Caldera of the Menders]] and find [[Mender Supplies]] on the ground in the main room downstairs. Make sure to use the provided [[Toxin Antidote]] to keep from passing out!
