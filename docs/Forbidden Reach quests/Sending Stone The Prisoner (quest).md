;Alliance
:So, Raszageth had a jailor. Or was Adamanthia our jailor? 
:Puzzling. I shall have this translated and added to the volumes for others to read. My thanks, <name>.
;Horde
:Huh. If this is right, then Raszageth was awake the entire time we were in stasis.
:I can see why she was so mad. I still do not agree with her or her methods, but anyone trapped for more than ten or twenty thousand years in a hole with little light is going to go mad. 
:I will get the translated version added to the transcripts we have been handing around. Thank you for this, <name>.
