'''Authentic Authorization''' is a series of quests from [[Cataloger Wulferd]] outside the [[Zskera Vaults]]. Each week he asks players for a different Neltharion-aligned objective from within the vaults.

==Objectives==
Find <the objective>.
* Speak with [[Pathfinder Jeb|Jeb]] to enter the Vault.
* [[Sealed Letter to Neltharion]] -or- 10x [[Neltharion-Signed Notes]] -or- 3x [[Random Scribblings]]

==Description==
The importance of this expedition can not be understated. I assure you, all who participate will have a place in history... along with me, of course!

If I can make one remarkable discovery, my scholarly legacy will be assured! But what will we find? A copy of [[Neltharion]]'s signature? One of his personal letters? Can't wait to find something to share with my fans. Also, I'll have more fans!

If you would be so kind as to find me something memorable, I'll offer you suitable remuneration! I can pay!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything?

==Completion==
What an amazing find. The mind reels. 

Oh, and I can't wait to write about this discovery and publish our findings. We will publish... or perish trying!

==Notes==
Each week, Wulferd will offer a different quest, which will be the same for all players regardless of vault progression.
