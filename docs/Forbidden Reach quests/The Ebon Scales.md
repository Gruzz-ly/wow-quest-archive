==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Ekrazathal.jpg|Ekrazathal|An ancient beast who holds the Ebon Scales trapped.}}
Reach [[Scalecommander Sarkareth]].
*Attack on [[Ekrazathal]] signaled
*Speak with Scalecommander Sarkareth.

==Description==
We got past the [[Primalist]] incursion. Now we must reach the creche.

Scalecommander Sarkareth is as tough as they come, and his [[weyrn]] holds the line. But a [[dragon]] has the [[Ebon Scales]] pinned down.

Time for us to join the fight!

Take point. Give the signal when we are in range of the dragon. Then we hit it with everything we have.

Watch out for ambushes. I have a bad feeling about this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|51|48}}
*9,850 [[XP]]
*[[Ekrazathal's Colored Fang]]

==Completion==
You fight well, evoker, but we had this under control.

The Ebon Scales look after our own.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''[[Dervishian]] and [[Azurathel]] start accompanying you.''
:{{Text|say|Dervishian|We need to grab that dragon's attention so the Ebon Scales can strike.}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|Get us close to the target and then give the signal, evoker.}}

Once near Ekrazathal, use the Mass Disintegration extra action button. A cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|QYupRBr3d_I}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|The order is given. Attack!}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Ebon Scales! Strike as one!}}
:''The dracthyr attack the tarasek and the proto-dragon, killing them. Kurog Grimtotem and his proto-dragon companions watch the events unfold.''
:{{Text|say|Wizened Stormrider|Those vermin sought to disrupt our ritual!}}
:{{Text|say|Wizened Stormrider|They are unworthy of the dragon blood in their veins!}}
:{{Text|say|Kurog Grimtotem|They mean nothing. Leave them.}}
:{{Text|say|Kurog Grimtotem|The elements have granted me the power I need.}}
:{{Text|say|Kurog Grimtotem|At long last, the Mistress of the Storm shall be free!}}
:''Kurog and his proto-dragons turn and leave. Above the creche, [[Ebyssian|two]] [[Wrathion|black dragons]] fly.''

On the other side of the cutscene:
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|We wake up to find a hostile dragon in our creche, then fight off an elemental army at our doorstep. I want answers, Azurathel!}}
:{{Text|say|Scalecommander Azurathel|Answers will have to wait. The Primalists spoke of unleashing a great storm upon the world. We must stop them.}}
