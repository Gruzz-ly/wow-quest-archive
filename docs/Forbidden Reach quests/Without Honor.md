Observe the Scene from the past.
*Nexus Point reached

*Observation Mode activated
*[[Technoscryers]] (provided)

==Description==
Ok, the goggles should be calibrated. Looks like the confluence point is right here on the ledge. I wonder what happened to him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Progress==
I wonder what we'll find?

==Completion==
<Zenata frowns somberly into the distance.>

The [[Deathwing|Earth Warder]]'s forces, going after one of their own... what do you think they meant by that?

==Notes==
Head to the Nexus Point, use the [[Technoscryers]], then hit #2 to activate Observation Mode:
:''A vision of [[Failed Scalecommander Abereth|Aspirant Abereth]] appears''
:{{text|say|Abereth|Finally, a moment to rest...}}
:''Three [[Neltharion Agent]]s suddenly appear around him.''
:{{text|say|Neltharion Agent|The Earth Warder commands you to die, dracthyr!}}
:{{text|say|Abereth|W-what?!}}
:''The agents attack Abereth.''

You can also dance with Zenata while wearing the [[Technoscryers]]. This is part of the [[Goggle Wobble]] achievement.
In response to this:
:{{text|emote|Zenata sighs...}}
