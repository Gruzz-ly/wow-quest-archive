==Description==
You are an [[evoker]], <name>. The best of the best. An elite [[soldier]] who has mastered the skills of each of our [[weyrn]]s.

I expect a lot of you.

Your memories may be broken, but the might of [[dragon]]s courses through your veins. Harness it.

One of your most potent weapons is your breath attack. The fire within becomes more powerful the longer you inhale.

These insects swarming over our training grounds should make fine targets.

*[[Fire Breath]]

You will also receive:
*{{Cost|25|27|20}}
*7,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
A nice, deep breath clears the head.

==Completion==
Good. You remember your training.

Keep your head low and your lungs full.

==Notes==
Kill [[Beetle Swarmer]]s, [[Scalecrawler Beetle]]s, and [[Mature Scalecrawler]].

==Progression==
{{Old Weyrn Grounds}}

==Patch changes==
