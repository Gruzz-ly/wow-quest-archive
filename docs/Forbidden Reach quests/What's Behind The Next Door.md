==Objectives==
Enter the vault and open 3 more doors using Zskera Vault Keys.
* Doors opened with [[Zskera Vault Key]]s (3)

==Description==
If we're going to keep exploring these vaults, we're going to need to open more doors! And that means we'll need more keys.

See if you can find more keys around [[Forbidden Reach]]. Every door is another opportunity!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you opened more doors?

==Completion==
Good work in there, my friend. We can continue our exploration as long as we have keys. 

I'm sure we'll find another vault to explore in a few days. My curiosity is killing me!

==Notes==
Find an additional [[Zskera Vault Key]] or three from [[Forbidden Hoard]]s, then reenter the [[:Zskera Vault: Az]] and pop open three more doors.

==Progression==
