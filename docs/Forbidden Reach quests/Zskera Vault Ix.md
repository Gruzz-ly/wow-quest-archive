'''Zskera Vault: Ix''' starts the third week of [[Zskera Vaults]] quests.

==Objectives==
Enter and explore Zskera Vault: Ix.
* Speak with [[Pathfinder Jeb]] to enter the vault
* [[Toadstool Danner|Secure the Vault]]
* Doors opened with [[Zskera Vault Key]]s
* Breaching Cannon fired (Optional)

==Description==
[[Cataloger Wulferd|Wulferd]] spotted [[Irontide Raiders|some pirates]] making their way into the vaults this morning. If we don't act fast, they'll strip the vault clean!

We're going into the vault immediately. There's no time to lose. Will you be joining us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you explored the vault? I'm worried about those pirates.

You're probably expecting me to make some pirate joke about "arrrr-tifacts," but I have too much self-control for that. I do, however, think the treasure we find will be... "booty-full." Okay, back to work.

==Completion==
Good work in there. We can continue this exploration as long as we have keys. In a few days, we'll explore another vault.

Ever since the storms died and Raszageth left, it's been a rush to grab as much as we can. Sadly, we're not the only folks rushing to grab it all. It's a good thing you're here to help us deal with that.

==Notes==
As usual, pick up [[Authentic Authorization]] before zoning in, then speak with Jeb:
:{{gossip|quest=|Lets explore Zskera Vault Ix}}

Inside:
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|There's been a fight, they must have come this way!}}
:''Jeb and Tacha run down the steps.''

Halfway down the steps, [[Volethi]] starts [[Not Forgotten]].

Plenty of [[thunder lizard]] and [[Irontide Raiders]] corpses on the way in, alongside an [[Irontide Coin Bag]] and a bottle of [[Irontide Wakeup]].

At the bottom:
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Tacha|Who are these guys?}}
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Jeb|They're up to no good. Anyone who has ever buried a loved one in Tiragarde knows these guys.}}
:{{text|say|Pathfinder Tacha|Grave robbers?}}
:{{text|say|Irontide Pillager|Please. I consider myself to be an enterprising opportunist! I prefer the word "resurrectionist."}}
:{{text|say|Irontide Pillager|I deal in redemption. And I look forward to... redeeming... the bodies of you and your friends.}}

After clearing out [[Toadstool Danner]], the Irontide [[Irontide Coin Counter|coin counter]], [[Irontide Pillager (Forbidden Reach)|pillager]], and [[Eratin the Barber]], use the [[Azerite Powder Barrel]] to pick up some [[Azerite Powder]], and the [[Igniter Torch]], then interact with the Breaching Cannon to blast open the southeastern vault door. Inside is an Energized Circlet, two [[Mysterious Chest]]s (1-2x [[Dormant Primordial Fragment]]), some Gold Piles, a [[Stuffed Bear]], and a Powerful Flask of Renewal.
