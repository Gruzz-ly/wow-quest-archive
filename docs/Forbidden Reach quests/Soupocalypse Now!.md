==Objectives==
Defeat [[Irontide Raiders|Irontide Pirates]] to drive off the invasion.
* Explosive Soup experiments obtained {{co|34.2|59.8|Forbidden Reach}}
* [[Morqut Glider|Glider]] taken {{co|35.7|59.0|Forbidden Reach}}
* Irontide Invader slain (50)

==Description==
[[File:Morqut Glider.jpg|thumb|Morqut Glider]]
The Irontide pirates think they can sail in and take over the islands. They clearly have no idea who they are dealing with. Our Morqut friends will provide you with the transportation. We dracthyr will provide the... munitions.

<[[Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Cindrethresh]] smirks.>

[[Fusethrian]] has been trying to learn to cook the [[tuskarr]] way with mixed results. Ask him for his more volatile attempts. We can get some safe disposal and run off these pirates in one go!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 450x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Did you teach those pirates not to sail into our waters?

==Completion==
Heh. I love the smell of soup-based munitions in the morning. Smells like victory.

==Notes and trivia==
Speak with [[Fusethrian]] by the renown envoys:
:Cooking is a little like alchemy! Who knew?
:{{gossip|<Ask for explosive... soup?>}}
:{{text|say|Fusethrian|Ah, yes. The early experiments.}}
:{{text|say|Fusethrian|Careful with this stuff, <name>. It is volatile.}}

Head over to the flight master, [[Renpiaq]], and hop on the [[Morqut Glider]] in front of him. It provides two abilities:
#{{abilities|Spicy Soup Bomb|Bomb enemies with a bowl of spicy experimental soup.|range=75|cd=5 sec|id=400466|image=|notes=Instant. Ground-targeted AoE}}
#{{abilities|Peppered Pufferfish|The caster throws an empowered Pufferfish which explodes.|range=75|cd=3 sec|id=400695|image=|notes=Instant.}}

Use them judiciously on the bombing run that it takes players on.

The quest title and completion text are references to the film ''{{wp|Apocalypse Now}}''.
