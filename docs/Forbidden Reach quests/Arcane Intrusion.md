==Objectives==
Investigate the beacon.
*[[Beacon (Forbidden Reach)|Beacon]] investigated

==Description==
That beacon ahead--I am certain it was not there before we were imprisoned.

Spellcraft is not my forte, but I know [[arcane]] [[magic]] when I see it. The same magic used by [[Lapisagos|the blue dragon]] in [[War Creche|the creche]].

He said a name... [[Malygos]]. It sounds so familiar, but the [[Neltharion|Earth-Warder]]'s teachings feel distant. Fragmented.

If this Malygos put us into stasis, perhaps the arcane beacon was placed on his orders.

Investigate the area and report back. Ensure the beacon cannot be used to call in enemy reinforcements.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Crimson Dracthyr Battlegear Helm]]
*{{Cost|12|63|60}}
*3,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There is powerful magic in the air. But it is ancient, fading.

==Completion==
<Azurathel listens intently as you tell him what you witnessed.>

So there were beacons placed outside the other creches as well.

Our allies are in peril. We must reach them!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|Scalecommander Azurathel|That beacon pulses with magic. It may have been placed there to contain us... or to send a signal.}}

After interacting with the Beacon, flashes of memories show in a cutscene.
