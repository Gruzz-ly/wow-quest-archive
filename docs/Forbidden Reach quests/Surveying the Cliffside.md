==Objectives==
Speak with [[Roska Rocktooth|Roska]] to start the dig then excavate artifacts from the cliffside.
*Tell Roska to start the dig
*Finds Unearthed (2)
*[[Archivist's Wind Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
Nothing like brisk ocean air to get you in the mood to dig!

We're standing in the rubble of an ancient [[Dragonkin|dragonkin]] fishing village. These dragonkin were ancestors of the blue dragonkin that live on the island today. Humble as it is, the remote location means it's gone relatively undisturbed by treasure hunters.

If there's anything left that hasn't fallen into the sea, we'll find it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost |28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Nothing like a good crag, eh <name>? Never know what you'll find!

==Completion==
<Roska lets out a low whistle.>

We got to this bad boy just in time, huh? Another hundred years, and it woulda been fish food!

==Notes==
On accept, after receiving [[Archivist's Wind Totem]] which summons [[Helpful Winds]]:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|This guy should make navigating the cliffside a breeze. Heh!}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth| Let me know when you're ready to get digging!}}

Tell Roska to start the dig:
{{book|content={{gossip|quest=|I'm ready to start digging!}}}}
:''Roska summons her earth totem and causes a minor earthquake.''
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Let's give this place a little rumble and see what shakes out, eh?}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|That ought to do it. Watch your step. Those rocks are slick!}}

Use the wind totem at Disturbed Earth then interact with it to hopefully find Rusted Dragonkin Pottery artifacts:
:{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|What a beauty!}}
:{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|That's why we're out here!}}
:{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|This one's gonna be a real treat, I can feel it!}}
:{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Better get digging!}}
:{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|That's a big chunk of history right there!}}

After excavating the artifact you may find [[Fish Bones (poor)]] and [[Salt-dried Roots]]

Otherwise it may whip up some [[Aggressive Surf]], with Roska yelling one of the following lines:
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Incoming!}}
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Whoa! Look out!}}

Or it'll dig up [[Just a Rock]], with Roska yelling one of the following lines:
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Sometimes life throws rocks at ya!}}
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Better luck next time!}}

Once both finds have been excavated:
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|This one's gonna be a real treat, I can feel it!}}

The major find is at {{co|14.1|14.7|Forbidden Reach}} on the broken bridge between the two islands. Interact with the [[Intact Dragon Cache]] to pick up [[The Cache in the Crag]].
