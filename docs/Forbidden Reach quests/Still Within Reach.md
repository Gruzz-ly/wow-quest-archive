==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Spellsworn Wingcatcher.jpg|Spellsworn Wingcatcher|Trained to counter the draconic magic of the [[dracthyr]], the wingcatchers of the Spellsworn are an especially deadly hunting force.}}

Kill the Spellsworn Wingcatcher at the [[Old Weyrn Grounds]] in the [[Forbidden Reach]].
*[[Spellsworn Wingcatcher]] slain {{co|59.0|57.6|Forbidden Reach}}
Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
While we [[dracthyr]] were kept in stasis, the [[Spellsworn]], ancient servants of [[Malygos]] the Spellweaver, were our wardens. However, despite being slain years ago, the late [[Dragon Aspects|Aspect]]'s forces are still loyal to him and his lasting directive to keep this island contained. They present a danger to any dracthyr still lost, wounded, or otherwise unaccounted for.

Scouts have reported the sighting of a rather large Spellsworn brute hunting for escaped dracthyr. This deadly pursuer must be dealt with.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 450 [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11900 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Has the threat been dealt with?

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>. You have diminished the risk to our rescue and recovery operations around the Forbidden Reach.

It may be too late for some, but know that other sets of wings will be able to fly home because of your actions.

==Notes==
The [[Spellsworn Wingcatcher]] is between the [[Old Weyrn Grounds]] and the [[Talonlords' Perch]], just south of the river in central [[Forbidden Reach]]. He is found near the corpses of three [[Escaped Dracthyr]].
