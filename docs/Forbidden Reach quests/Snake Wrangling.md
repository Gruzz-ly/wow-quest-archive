==Objectives==
[[File:Snake Wrangling.jpg|thumb|A water elemental full of snakes]]
Relocate 6 Toxic Watersnakes to the pools in the [[Caldera of the Menders]].
* [[Toxic Watersnake]] collected (6)
* Release Watersnakes

==Description==
The same toxins that plague our [[Support Creche]] are seeping into migrating watersnakes.

We need to relocate the snakes back to their original pools. If we don't, that invasive species is going to wreak havoc on the environment.

I can loan you a friendly water elemental to help you transport the snakes. It's for our own safety as much as theirs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 450x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]
* +350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
We must relocate these snakes before they do too much damage to surrounding wildlife.

==Completion==
This is great! We're really making progress revitalizing the Caldera of the Menders.

==Notes==
The water elemental behind [[Cataloger Coralie|Coralie]] joins the player as a guardian, but will not take part in combat. At the [[Caldera of the Menders]], be on the lookout for [[Rustling Bush]]es. Interact with one to rustle up a snake — which handily swims into the water elemental's body.

After collecting six, get down to water level to make an extra action button appear:
