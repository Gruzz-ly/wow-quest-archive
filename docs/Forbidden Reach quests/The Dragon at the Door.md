==Objectives==
Defeat Lapisagos and escape the [[War Creche]].
*Exit reached
*[[Lapisagos]] slain

==Description==
That [[blue dragon]] will collapse [[War Creche|the creche]] and trap us inside!

He claims to serve [[Malygos]]. That name is familiar, but... why would any [[dragon]] want to keep us prisoner?

Listen, <name>. We were trained to fight beside the dragons, not against them. But we have been left with no choice.

Time to do what must be done, [[evoker]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|50|54|40}}
*9,850 [[XP]]
*[[Crystalline Lapis]]
*"The War Creche" criterion of [[Dracthyr, Awaken]]

==Completion==
We will get that rubble cleared and make sure no [[dracthyr]] is left behind.

But first, we need to secure this area.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|[[Scalecommander Azurathel]]|We were trained to defend dragons, not to fight them. This feels... wrong.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Scalecommander Cindrethresh]]|Lapisagos has left us no choice, Zury. He means to destroy us.}}
:{{Text|Say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|So today, we fight for each other. For all dracthyr!}}
:{{Text|Say|Scalecommander Azurathel|Well said, my friend.}}

The two, along with [[Kodethi]] and [[Dervishian]] run up the stairs and start blasting Lapisagos, who is already fighting a pair of [[Obsidian Warder]]s and [[Dark Talon (NPC)|Dark Talons]].

;Aggro Lapisagos
:{{Text|Yell|Lapisagos|You dare defy the will of Malygos?!}}

*{{Text|bossemote|Target yourself and cast  [Living Flame] to heal.}}

*{{Text|Yell|Lapisagos|I have spent ages guarding you aberrations!}}
*{{Text|yell|Lapisagos|Beg for the mercy of your arcane prisons!}}

;Killing him
:{{Text|Say|Lapisagos|You are... out of... time...}}

As a final act, Lapisagos trashes the exit, and the room fills with thick gas.

:{{Text|Yell|Scalecommander Azurathel|Go! The creche is collapsing!}}

As you make it out of the ruins to the [[Old Weyrn Grounds]]:
:{{Text|Say|Kodethi|Our training grounds are completely overgrown! We must have been in stasis for a very, very long time.}}
:{{Text|Say|Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Cut the chatter, Kodethi! Hostiles could be lurking. Evoker, time to get those skills sharpened!}}
