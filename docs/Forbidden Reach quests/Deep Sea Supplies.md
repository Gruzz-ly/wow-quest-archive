==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Farscale Tidelord.jpg|Farscale Tidelord|Massive and mean.}}
Slay Farscale Naga and gather their supplies.
* [[Farscale Supplies]] (50)
* [[Farscale Tidelord]] slain {{co|74.7|66.8|Forbidden Reach}}

==Description==
[[File:Farscale Supply Chest.jpg|thumb|Farscale Supply Chest]]
We are accustomed to threats emerging from the sea. But there are some enemies that should never be allowed on our shores.

In the east, [[naga]] are advancing on our beaches and coves. They've brought supplies with them. If we could reduce the local naga population and seize their supplies, our chances of survival here would increase.  

Here's the plan: take those supplies from their caches or their corpses, and slay their leader. Lives are on the line.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 350x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
* +350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Have you collected those supplies?

==Completion==
Thank you for facing waves and waves of naga. Their supplies will certainly help us support our settlement, so we can make a home here.

==Notes==
Defeat naga of the Farscale tribe in and around the [[Burrow of the Faithful]] for their [[Farscale Supplies]], including [[Farscale Brute|brutes]], [[Farscale Hunter|hunters]], [[Farscale Myrmidon|myrmidons]], and [[Farscale Siren|sirens]]. Additionally, [[Farscale Supply Chest]]s also contain supplies.

The [[Farscale Tidelord|tidelord]], an elite, is upstairs in the burrow to the east. Handily, he also drops supplies.
