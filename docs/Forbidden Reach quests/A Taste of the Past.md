==Objectives==
Find Atrenosh Hailstone and see if she would like to open the cache with you.
*[[Atrenosh Hailstone]] Informed {{co|34.6|57.6|Forbidden Reach}}
*[[Intact Dragonkin Cache]] opened {{co|17.3|16.4|Forbidden Reach}}

==Description==
Usually, we go to great lengths to avoid busting artifacts open, but I think in this case we'll learn more about the past from what's inside than just staring at a sealed barrel.

That said, there's someone we should get permission from first. It's her history, after all. In fact, I think she's the only person still around who might have a personal stake in this find.

I'll see to getting this up the cliff. Ask if Atrenosh Hailstone wants to watch us crack 'er open, eh?

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
: {{abilities|Azerothian Archives: Winglord's Perch, Forbidden Reach Site|Unlock the Azerothain Archives' World Quests in Winglord's Perch of the Forbidden Reach.}}

You will receive:
* {{Cost |28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
<Roska looks proud of your hard work.>

==Completion==
That's what this is all about, eh?

Connecting folks with their pasts, making them feel like they're a part of something. It's easier to know where you're going when you know where you came from.

==Notes==
Head back to [[Morqut Village]] and speak with [[Atrenosh Hailstone]]:
{{book|content={{gossip|quest=|<Share your archaeological finds.>}}}}
:{{text|say|Atrensoh Hailstone|Ah, well... I guess I could go take a look at it. No one else would know but me.}}
:{{text|say|[[Scalecommander Viridia]]|Would it make it easier if I came with you?}}
:{{text|say|Atrensoh Hailstone|Hm... yes, I think it would.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|Then we'll be on our way shortly. Meet us there, <name>.}}

Return to Roska's camp on the island:
:{{text|say|Atrenosh Hailstone|To think we used to call this place home, but it's been thousands of years since any of us set foot here...}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Hey! There's our excavator of the hour.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Let's crack this open, make it a proper homecoming!}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|Is that sound archeological practice?}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Not usually, but we'll learn more from it opened than closed.}}

Open it:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|It appears to be... honey? Ancient, blue honey?}}
:{{text|say|Atrenosh Hailstone|Aha! There used to be blue lillies growing all around these cliffs! I wonder if the honey's still good?}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Viridia|Honey has been known to last indefinitely under the right conditions, but I'm not certain...}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|Worst case scenario, I'm sure you can heal an upset stomach!}}

On complete, Atrenosh tries the honey:
:{{text|say|Atrenosh Hailstone|That's salty!}}
:''Viridia laughs.''
