'''Plunder Siege''' is a one-off quest at the [[Morqut Village]] during max-level [[Forbidden Reach]] questing introducing players to [[Forbidden Hoard]]s.

==Objectives==
Recover [[Atrenosh Hailstone|Atrenosh]]'s Journal from chests within the [[Forbidden Reach]].
*[[Atrenosh's Journal]]

==Description==
We're not the only ones to have noticed the storms abating over the Forbidden Reach. 

Other interested parties have arrived too, looting everything they can and storing their spoils in chests. If they use [[Deathwing|Neltharion]]'s old hoard chests, they're in for a surprise when the chests' enchantments lock them out. We'll need to clear out surrounding looters to break the chests' enchantments.

See if you can recover a stolen item, specifically my old journal. It's nowhere to be found.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 450x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find it?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

My world has changed so drastically since I last wrote in this. It will be an interesting read given what I know now.

==Notes==
[[Forbidden Hoard]]s appear all over the [[Forbidden Reach]]. See the Hoard article for locations.

==Progression==
