'''Zskera Vault: Kx''' starts the fourth week of [[Zskera Vaults]] quests.

==Objectives==
Enter and explore Zskera Vault: Kx.
* Speak with [[Pathfinder Jeb]] to enter the vault
* [[Savage Overseer|Secure the Vault]]
* Doors opened with [[Zskera Vault Key]]s
* Breaching Cannon fired (Optional)

==Description==
I was afraid this might happen. The [[Sundered Flame]] is here. And they've discovered the Vaults.

Of course, we have to stop them. Anything useful or dangerous, they're going to take straight to [[Sarkareth]].

I've had enough of his nonsense. Time for you to do what you do best.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you explored the vault?

==Completion==
Good work in there. As long as we find more keys, we can continue exploring. And then it's only a matter of time until we find another vault to explore... a few days, I'll bet.

Oh, and good luck with the Sundered Flame. I hate to see dracthyr fighting dracthyr... especially when we can be uncovering the secrets of the past instead. Stay safe out there.

==Notes==
As usual, pick up [[Authentic Authorization]] before zoning in, then speak with Jeb:
:{{gossip|quest=|Let's explore Zskera Vault Kx.}}

Inside, tarasek have taken over, with two [[Savage Overseer]]s channeling something into an artifact. Take them out, then open a vault door as always.

In the middle of the room is a [[Pillaged Primordial Cache]] (a condensed magic stone), a Crate of Unfinished Scrolls, which provides the Scattered Teleport extra action button, a Reagent Pot, an an Obsidian Enchanting Table.
