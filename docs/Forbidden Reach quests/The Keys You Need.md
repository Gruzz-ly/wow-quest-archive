==Objectives==
Take the keys from [[Tacha]] at the [[Zskera Vaults]].

==Description==
Can I trust you? These are the only keys we have. If we lose them, we can't open any locked doors.

Here. Take them. Use them on the doors within this chamber. You look like a hero. Be bold! Throw those doors wide! You'll find glory or... um... something that is not glory but is still amazing! Just don't die.

We might find more, but we'll have to search the island to find them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 6x [[Zskera Vault Key]]
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Be sure to not to lose those keys. Did I say that? I think I said that.

==Notes==
This is the only free source of {{item|Zskera Vault Key|s}}. Additional keys are in [[Forbidden Hoard]]s and drop from rares that pop up all over the [[Forbidden Reach]].

==Progression==
{{Zskera Vaults}}
