==Objectives==
Meet [[Roska Rocktooth]] at [[Winglord's Perch]] in [[Forbidden Reach]].

==Description==
We've discovered an ancient fishing village in the Forbidden Reach! It's this humble isle off the northwest coast with its own crumbling bridge and everything!

I'll be there if you're looking for more dirt to dig up!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost |2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>! You made it!

That sea air really wakes you up!

==Notes==
Off the northwest shore of [[Forbidden Reach]] is [[Winglord's Perch]]. Roska has new gossip:

{{book|content=
Nothing better than standing in the dirt, knowing that just beneath your feet could be a little piece of history.

{{gossip|What can you tell me about the history of this place?}}

Way before anything bad went down on this island, the dragonkin used to have a little fishing village here.

It's all ruins now, salt-covered and half-falling into the ocean, but the fact that the Reach has been isolated for so long should mean that it hasn't been picked over by scavengers.

We were lucky, and some of the artifacts still remained that could tell us more about how these ancient dragonkin lived.

{{gossip|What can you tell me about the geology of this place?}}

This little cliff-side island is made up of granite, which means it's very hard but very brittle. We won't be able to dig down very far, but that's all right. 

What we want will be hidden in the rubble or the topsoil. Nothing's getting in that granite.

Because we're so far out into the ocean though, this place gets battered by the elements--salty winds, enormous waves, storms--all that can take a toll on the archaeological record. 

It can also sweep an unwary archaeologist out to sea!

My wind elemental can help keep you safe and help blow any topsoil and salt off your finds.
