'''Primordial Answers''' starts from [[Earthcaller Yevaa]] on the ''third'' level of [[Zskera Vault: Az]]. Use the [[Positional Displacer]] or [[Bubble Lifter]] to get up to her. 

==Objectives==
Obtain a Primordial Earth, Fire, Water and Storm Core from the [[elemental]]s within the [[Zskera Vaults]].
*[[Primordial Earth Core]]
*[[Primordial Water Core]]
*[[Primordial Storm Core]]
*[[Primordial Flame Core]]

==Description==
Revelations await us within this vault. Perhaps we'll find a way to protect ourselves against [[Primalist]] magic. The elementals hiding in these vaults are wild, ancient, and free of Primalist control. Perhaps they hold the secret to helping the elementals on the surface.

I have an idea. We'll need four primordial cores. Then we can construct a talisman that can purify and remove the influence of Primalist control from the elementals outside.

If you help us, I will share what we have found here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Zskera Vault Key]]
* [[Neltharion Gift Token]]
* 22x [[Elemental Overflow]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found the cores?

==Completion==
These primordial cores are all I need here. 

Please let me share with you the things I have found. May they help you in your efforts.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Earthcaller Yevaa|<Name>, your presence here is most timely.}}

Yevaa also has some gossip:
:Never doubt the bond of the earth.
:It is steadfast and supports us in all our actions.
:{{gossip|How did you get here?}}
:One can achieve incredible things with the aid of the elements. 
:In other words, Oretz smashed the doors down!

Primordial cores spawn in other rooms on their own. No need to specifically look for elemental mobs.
