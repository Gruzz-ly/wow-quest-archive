'''Angler's Challenge''' is a standard [[lunker]] daily quest for the [[Iskaara Tuskarr]] in the [[Forbidden Reach]].

==Objectives==
Gather 3 Lunker Morsels from Lunkers in [[Dragonskull Island]] Fishing Hole.
*Summon Lunker at the Large Lunker Sighting (Optional) {{co|76.2|44.5|Forbidden Reach}}
*[[Lunker Morsel]] (3)

==Description==
Say, have you noticed how good the fishing is around here? Dragonskull Island seems like it would have some great spots.

Why don't you go there and catch something for dinner? Be mindful, though. We still need to set some of our catch aside for later.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|28|9}}
*9500 [[XP]]
*450x [[Elemental Overflow]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Iskaara Tuskarr]]
*+350 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]
*+350 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]

==Progress==
I can almost taste those fresh fish!

==Completion==
I've heard about "fine dining." I don't quite know what that is, but I know we'll eat well tonight!

==Notes==
Just south of [[Dragonskull Island]] on the northern shore of [[Stormsunder Mountain]] is the Large Lunker Sighting and Dragonskull Island Fishing Hole.

Toss 5x [[Ominous Conch]] at the lunker sighting to summon a [[Massive Thresher]] (worth one [[Lunker Morsel]]) or a [[Gigantic Thresher]] (worth three).

==Progression==
