==Objectives==
Meet with Prophet Velen in the Exodar.
*Spare Hologem used (Optional)
*Return to [[Velen]] in the [[Exodar]]
*[[Spare Hologem]] (provided)

==Description==
With [[Sironas]] slain once again, [[Bloodmyst Isle|Bloodmyst]] will finally be able to heal. Her influence was no doubt anchoring the corruption to the land.

It is another reason to celebrate today. But it is not the true reason I called [[Hatuun]] and [[Arzaal]] to [[Azeroth]].

I would have them attend the [[Tishamaat]] with us.

The sacrament asks us to reflect on the past and commit to a better future. The unity of our efforts epitomizes that.

I will bring them to the Exodar. Please join us when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*850 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Completion==
It brings me great joy to see the [[eredar]] gathered together at last.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Now, truthfully, I... did not invite you to Azeroth merely for this mission--but for the Tishamaat as well.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzaal|The Tishamaat? I... Thank you, but surely my presence would cast a shadow over the sacrament.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|The first sacrament of Tishamaat asks us to reflect on the shadows of our past. I will make sure you feel welcome.}}
:{{Text|say|Arzaal|As you wish, Prophet.}}
:''Arzaal bows.''
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Hatuun, this may seem to you a hollow gesture, but I would like us to speak. The Tishamaat asks we learn from our mistakes...}}
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|I will... consider it. Let us go.}}
:''All three are teleported.''

Meet with Velen back at the ''Exodar'' which is now even busier with people. Romuul and Ataanya have a dialogue nearby:
:{{Text|say|[[Grand Artificer Romuul]]|Please tell me the generator is offline for a good reason. No, actually, do not. I do not want to know.}}
:{{Text|say|[[High Artificer Ataanya]]|Is a generator ever offline for a good reason?}}
