==Completion==
These islands will serve as the home to thousands.  Most of these people will remain here their entire lives.  If you so desired, you could do the same.  But that's not what you want, is it, <name>?

<Velen nods.>

You will do many more great things before you pass.  You must embrace your destiny and meet it head on!

Before you leave, I present you with two gifts:  This tabard is worn by only the most revered of the [[Hand of Argus]] and this signet ring worn by our wisest [[sage]]s.  Wear them both with pride, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Signet Ring of the Hand]]
*[[Signet Ring of the Hand (caster)]]
You will also receive:
*[[Tabard of the Hand]]

You will receive:
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Exodar (faction)|Exodar]]

==Notes==
*This quest is [[Draenei (playable)|Draenei]]-only.
*This is the last quest in the Bloodmyst Isle storyline, but there is no follow-up breadcrumb quest. After completing Bloodmyst Isle, you can move on to any of the level 20-25 Alliance zones: [[Ashenvale]], [[Duskwood]], or [[Wetlands]].

;Prophet Velen's gossip
This is all for you, <name>.  You did this.  You saved all of these people and thousands more.

You have risen above the strife and tragedy of this world and in doing so, elevated all of us with you.

You have done so much - more than many could do in ten lifetimes - yet your life has just begun.  If only we had a thousand heroes like you.

But listen well, <name>.  Your destiny lies in the Outland.  I have seen it in visions, a prophecy yet untold.

Find our people, <name>.  Find them and bring them home...
