==Objectives==
Return to [[Grand Artificer Romuul]] in the [[Exodar]].
*Spare Hologem used (Optional)
*Return to Romuul in the Exodar
*[[Spare Hologem]] (provided)

==Description==
My mother died on a colony planet. [[Exarch Hataaru|My father]] and I helped each other move past that, but when he died in the siege of [[Shattrath]], watching the walls of his greatest accomplishment crumble to dust...

There was no one left for me.

So I worked. And now I have the schematics of my own Shattrath. A better Shattrath.

<Ataanya clenches [[Exarch Hataaru's Artificing Lens|the lens]] in her fist then exhales in resignation.>

I'll go to the Exodar--but if Romuul says one word about it, I will make him eat his soldering tool.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*850 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Completion==
In some ways, getting Ataanya here was a more difficult victory than the fall of [[Antorus]].

Levity aside, I am glad she is here. I knew the [[Tishamaat]] would be hard for her. Her father was a great man, and we all mourn his passing.

This Tishamaat is gearing up to be one for our holo-records! 

<Romuul lowers his voice confidingly.>

Even Hatuun is here!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|My father was [[Draenor]]'s greatest [[artificer]].}}
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|He lived for Shattrath--and died in it. Sometimes I wondered if I'd end up the same.}}
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|But I will not. The city I have designed is what this one should have been. What it could have been.}}
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|I... will take the data crystal to the Exodar. To the Tishamaat.}}
:{{Text|emote|Beruun smiles, but tries to hide it.}}
:''Ataanya teleports away using a hologem.''

Before you leave you can talk to Beruun who has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
Thank you, <name>. I thought she was going to throw something at you, but that went a lot better than expected!

I'm really happy you could help Ataanya. My parents died when my hooves were still soft, and Ataanya has been the closest thing to family I've ever really had.

Anyway, I'll clean up here and then I'll see you at the Tishamaat!}}

Use the Spare Hologem to get back to the ''Exodar'' and meet with Ataanya and Romuul there. A lot more draenei have gathered since leaving.
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|I am glad you could join us, High Artificer. You have spared me many headaches.}}
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|Hmph. Let's transfer the schematics before I change my mind.}}
:''Romuul and Ataanya head off and enter the central chamber. [[Chieftain Hatuun]] is nearby standing over an [[Injured Traveler]].''
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|Even on Azeroth, [[demon]]s are brazen. Bold.}}

Behind Hatuun is an [[Argussian Mana Ray]]. [[Farseer Nobundo]] and an [[Azuremyst Anchorite]] are healing the travelers, and an [[Aspiring Farseer]] is kneeling next to one. New additions to the rest of the area include draenei seen in previous quests: [[Miner Landani]], [[Miner Jareeth]], [[Crystalsmith Laharu]], [[Shattrath Crystalsmith]]s, [[Auchenai Vindicator (heritage)|Auchenai Vindicators]], [[Auchenai Soulpriest (heritage)|Auchenai Soulpriests]], as well as [[High Priestess Ishanah]] and [[Grand Anchorite Almonen]].
