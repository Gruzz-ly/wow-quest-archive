'''An Artificer's Appeal''' begins the [[Draenei (playable)|draenei]] [[heritage armor]] questline, added during the [[Dark Heart campaign]]. It is pushed automatically to level 50+ draenei characters or it can be accepted from the [[Magically-Sealed Parcel]] at {{Co|53.13|15.69|Stormwind City}} in front of the [[Stormwind Embassy]] in [[Stormwind City]].

==Objectives==
Meet Grand Artificer Romuul in the Exodar.
*Spare Hologem used (Optional)
*Meet [[Grand Artificer Romuul|Romuul]] in the [[Exodar]]
*[[Spare Hologem]] (provided)

==Description==
<A parcel arrives for you from the Exodar, bearing the seal of the grand [[artificer]].

You open the small box and find a smooth, hexagonal crystal about the size of your palm.

When you touch it, a holographic message flashes to life in the air above it. In the message, Grand Artificer Romuul instructs you to come to the Exodar at your earliest convenience.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
My apologies for bringing you here on such short notice, <name>, but your help right now would be most appreciated.

I have found myself with many surprise deadlines.

"Surprise" and "deadlines" are not words I like together in the same sentence.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|Hello? Eh? Is this hologem still muted? Ah, no? Good, good!}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|When you receive this, <name>, come to the Exodar swiftly! I need your help on a special project!}}

Use the gem to be teleported to the [[Trader's Tier]], near Grand Artificer Romuul. Behind him is an [[Arkonite Generator]].
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|There you are, <name>. I thought perhaps the hologem I sent did not have enough charge.}}

The area is phased with new NPCs: [[Exodar Worker]]s, [[Assistant Artificer]]s, [[Off-Duty Vindicator]]s, [[Aspiring Farseer]]s, [[Krokul Ridgestalker (Exodar)|Krokul Ridgestalkers]], [[Pack Talbuk (Exodar)|Pack Talbuk]]s, [[Pack Elekk]]s, [[Draenei Child (Exodar)|Draenei Child]], [[Tamed Marsuul]], [[Tabaanu]], and [[Farseer Nobundo]].

Nobundo's gossip:
{{Dialogue|I am pleased that [[Velen]] has kept his promise to welcome any [[krokul]] who wished to journey from [[Argus]] to [[Azeroth]].

Not that I doubted the Prophet's beneficence, but pessimism in these matters is reasonable, given the past.

Perhaps we are finally, truly moving on from it.}}
