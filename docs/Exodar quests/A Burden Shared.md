==Objectives==
Collect 10 Memory Stones, create your own Memory Stone, and then dissolve the stones in the [[Flame of Reprieve]].
*Memory Stones collected (10)
*Personal Memory Stone created
*Memory Stones dissolved

==Description==
The [[Tishamaat]] was once a solitary holiday. Each [[eredar]] would inscribe a stone with a painful memory we carried. We would reflect on what that memory could teach us then commit to moving forward with that wisdom.

At last, the stones are dissolved in the Flame of Reprieve, symbolically removing the weight from our souls.

Today, the Tishamaat will be celebrated not in solitude, but as a community.

Gather the stones of those who would trust you with them then take them to the flame.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*6,800 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Progress==
For many, this is the first Tishamaat they have participated in. For others, it is a distant memory.

==Completion==
The [[draenei]] have suffered, scattered and solitary, for too long.

Today, we allow ourselves to rely on each other.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|You will serve as our tishataan, the memory bearer of Tishamaat. It is a solemn role.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Take this basin and gather our people's memory stones. Take them to the Flame of Reprieve and lift our burdens.}}

Go around the [[Trader's Tier]] and collect the memory stones of: [[Prophet Velen]], [[Chieftain Hatuun]], [[Grand Artificer Romuul]], [[High Artificer Ataanya]], [[Arzaal]], [[Vindicator Boros]], [[Farseer Nobundo]], [[High Priestess Ishanah]], [[Exarch Naielle]], and [[Akama]].

Then head to [[Grand Anchorite Almonen]] to make your own memory stone.
{{Dialogue|class=plainlist|Are you ready to create your memory stone?

It has been some time since the last Tishamaat, so I have been advising celebrants on the ritual.

First, you must inscribe your name near the top of the stone.

And below that, inscribe a description of the memory whose burden you wish to be relieved of.

I almost refused to come.

I have lived in Terokkar since... what happened. It was not a perfect situation, but after a time, it became comfortable. Stable.

Solitary.

After what my Rangari and I allowed to happen, I could not return to living among those I had failed.

But perhaps the Tishamaat is the correct time to confront that guilt.

{{Gossip|quest=|May I take your memory stone to the Flame of Reprieve?}}

<Naielle places her stone in the basin.>

{{Dialogue|title=Elder Kuruti|
My people were treated like outsiders and so we chose to be outsiders. We embraced our isolation and grew stronger because of it.

Had the anchorites of Telredor respected our strength, addressed us as equals--perhaps we could have spoken. Instead, they treated us like wayward talbuk needing to be brought back to the field.

But I have reasoned it was ignorance and not malice that fueled them. They were ascetics for centuries. To say their social skills are lacking would be kind.

I am not one to be stung twice, but since I have been asked here as an equal, I will hear them out.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Anchorite Ahuurn|
It was difficult, but I brought news of the Tishamaat to each settlement of Lost Ones across Draenor that I could find. I was not asked to do this, but I felt it was important.

I have spent several years meditating on my feelings about the krokul and the Lost Ones.

Truthfully, I feared them--not as one fears a beast, but as one fears the ocean.

I could not live there, and so it is death and darkness to me. I want to bring everyone in that darkness into the sunlight. But in my fear, I forget that there are fish.

We are all part of the same people, but we need not live the same lives.

It is comforting to know that the Auchenai are once again caring for the spirits of our fallen.

Ah, I spoke with him earlier before you accompanied him to Bloodmyst.

He speaks what is on his mind and does not tolerate disrespect. It is refreshing.

Thank you for helping us bring these spirits to the Tishamaat, <name>.

{{Dialogue|title=Exarch Maladaar|
We brought these spirits to the Tishamaat so that the sacrament may help relieve them of their burdens and allow them to truly rest.

But I did not expect that they might help ease the burdens of others as well.

I believe this will truly make a difference for them--both the living and the dead. Thank you for helping make this a possibility.

I had almost forgotten Kelios. So darkened are my memories of that distant past. So narrowed.

And for a moment, I can almost see it.

<Akama places his stone in the basin.>

I have suffered much in my wandering.

Perhaps it is time to return.}}

{{Gossip|What do you think of Hatuun?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I respect anyone with that much demon blood on their hands.

Hatuun knows as well as I do what it is to live amidst the ashes of your home, to see it defiled while you are powerless to stop it. It is a feeling you do not forget.

I trust us both to never let it happen again.}}

{{Gossip|What do you think of the [[Penitents]]?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
The loyalties of demons are fleeting. Sometimes, that can be useful.

I have known some demons to serve the Illidari, fighting against their former Legion masters. I am not surprised that some man'ari would also turn on the hand that fed them.

Watch them closely.}}}}

The Triumvirate has been assigned to escort Arzaal and the other Penitents during the Tishamaat.

Although I trust the Prophet's judgment, I had the same apprehensions as the others when we were quietly informed some time ago.

Perhaps I will always have those apprehensions.

For now, I will accept that their past might not be their future. They will be given the chance to prove it.

I am thankful for the vindicators' presence. It appears to comfort the others.

And Boros has offered to guide me around Azuremyst after the Tishamaat has concluded.

I remain cautious.

Their aspirations are not impossible. It is true that I hold High Commander Lothraxion in great esteem, despite the sins he once committed.

And I have seen the Penitents provide aid on Argus as we fight to purge the Legion's lingering infestation.

But that is a simple battle. When harder battles come, we will see if their promises are built on stone or sand.

It has been a long time since I last saw this many eredar in one place. Perhaps not since Argus was corrupted--when I still served on the Council to the Triumvirate.

It is... uncomfortable to know that krokul exist beyond Argus, on this "Draenor" that Nobundo spoke of.

:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|You do not have to answer me now. Enjoy the Tishamaat. But there will always be a seat open for you--if you want it.}}
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|Thank you. I will... I will think on it.}}

Afterward, Velen and Hatuun have new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Prophet Velen|
On Argus, Hatuun was my chief councilor. His advice was bold and unapologetic.

He did not keep me at a distance as many did. He was never afraid to overstep or offend. I missed that bluntness more than I knew.

He was as much of a leader as I was. Perhaps, in time, he will join us again.
}}

{{Dialogue|title=Chieftain Hatuun|
For thousands of years, all I could see when I looked at Argus was what it once was. A double-vision that fled from me whenever I focused too closely.

And now Velen asks me to return to what I once was. To what we both were.

<Hatuun crosses his arms more tightly.>

I... need time to think.

*[[Grand Artificer Romuul]] and [[High Artificer Ataanya]].

{{Dialogue|title=Grand Artificer Romuul|It has been a very long day. Without your help, it would have been even longer.

{{Gossip|quest=|May I take your memory stone to the Flame of Reprieve?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
<Romuul places his stone in the basin.>

Eternal progress--ever forward! This is what the order of artificers was founded on many millennia ago.

But each step begins in the soil we have already tread.

{{Dialogue|title=High Artificer Ataanya|
<Ataanya is idly adjusting her artificing lens but quickly stops when you approach.>

What?

{{Gossip|quest=|May I take your memory stone to the Flame of Reprieve?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
<Ataanya places her stone in the basin.>

Construction of this architectural marvel will represent the pinnacle of draenei artificing.

The Vindicaar will look like a child's toy compared to what we will make together.

You have my word.
