==Objectives==
Speak to Ataanya in [[Shattrath City]].
*Spare Hologem used (Optional)
*Speak to [[High Artificer Ataanya|Ataanya]]
*[[Spare Hologem]] (provided)

==Description==
During this [[Tishamaat]], Ataanya and I will present our project's schematics.

Ataanya is High [[Artificer]] of Shattrath. Her father was my late mentor, the famed [[Exarch Hataaru]].

Hataaru's hoofplates are hard to fill, but Ataanya has more than done so.

She has the schematics, and she should be here when they are presented. But she is not responding to my messages.

Ataanya seldom leaves the city, but surely she can make an exception for the Tishamaat. Perhaps you can reason with her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 850 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Progress==
Whatever you need, I don't have time for it.

==Completion==
I have a data crystal prepared. The schematics are on it.

My apprentice can find it for you.

I have no time to leave Shattrath.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|[[Grand Artificer Romuul]]|Ataanya can be as stubborn as a talbuk in the mud, but do not let her turn you away.}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|Go swiftly. Use my hologem if you need.}}

Use the gem to be teleported to [[Aldor Rise]]. Head to the building at {{Co|35.65|46.11|Shattrath City}} to find new additions - [[Apprentice Beruun]] and his [[warp stalker]] pet, [[Azeek]]. Proceed further to the balcony and approach High Artificer Ataanya, who is working on an [[Unfinished Vigilant]]:
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|If you are here to interrupt me, be advised that I have an arc welder and zero patience.}}

Speak to Ataanya:
{{Dialogue|I am busy. What do you want?

{{Gossip|quest=|Romuul needs you to bring your schematics to [[Exodar]] and present them at the Tishamaat.}}}}
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|As I told Romuul, the schematics are ready. But if he is waiting for me at the Exodar, he can keep waiting.}}
:{{Text|say|High Artificer Ataanya|My work is here in Shattrath. I will not put it on hold to attend some archaic holiday.}}
