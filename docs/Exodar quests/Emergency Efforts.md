==Objectives==
Use the Argussian Mana Ray to fly to Bloodmyst Isle with [[Chieftain Hatuun]].
*[[Argussian Mana Ray]] mounted
*Ride to [[Bloodmyst Isle]]

==Description==
<Name>! [[Velen]] told me I may find you here. He needs your assistance.

The [[satyr]] that infest a nearby island have been ambushing [[draenei]] traveling for the [[Tishamaat]].

Velen and I have been attempting to solve the problem quietly. He does not wish to mobilize the [[vindicator]]s and alarm his people on a day of sacrament.

But, despite our efforts, the attacks have continued. The event may need to be canceled if we cannot get the [[demon]]s under control.

Come with me so we may end this threat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|34}}
*850 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Progress==
I was hoping Hatuun would find you.

==Completion==
I was hoping to resolve the sudden satyr attacks before I formally announced the Tishamaat to all...

Alas, I am grateful [[Romuul]] called you to the [[Exodar]] early.

I assume Hatuun has explained the situation to you?

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|Take this mana ray. We will fly to meet Velen in Bloodmyst together.}}

Hatuun and [[Nobundo]] have new gossip:
{{Dialogue|title=Hatuun|
Velen awaits us back in Bloodmyst.

Come, we will put an end to this.

{{Gossip|When did you and your people arrive?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Velen sent a messenger to [[Argus]] some days ago to announce the Tishamaat. I do not control my people. Those who wished to go were free to make that choice.

I did not, but then Velen sent another message earlier today requesting my aid here.

I considered refusing, but Velen has been... agreeable lately. And it is satisfying to see him admit when he cannot solve a problem himself.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}}}

{{Dialogue|title=Nobundo|
I have seen worse injuries than these, but I share Hatuun's concerns.

Please, see to it that the situation in Bloodmyst is resolved before the Tishamaat begins.

I will stay here and tend to the wounded.}}

Take the Mana Ray and travel to Bloodmyst Isle with Hatuun:
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|Velen reports that there were at least four satyr attacks on draenei traveling through [[Azuremyst]] since morning.}}
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|I wished to rally the vindicators, but Velen does not want to cause panic and "darken" the Tishamaat. Feh!}}
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|He wants to quietly drive the satyrs back into Bloodmyst to keep travelers safe--for now.}}
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|But Velen realized this half measure will not work without assistance, so he called upon me and other recent allies to help.}}
:{{Text|say|Chieftain Hatuun|We are experts in the killing of demons as are you. With your aid, we should accomplish this quickly--and quietly.}}

The adventurer and Hatuun arrive to [[Middenvale]] where Velen is with [[Arzaal]].
:{{Text|say|Arzaal|[[Bloodmyst Radiation|This corruption]] caused by the Exodar crash feels... strange.}}
:{{Text|say|Prophet Velen|Indeed. The nether energies seeping from the ship have made Bloodmyst difficult to cleanse.}}

Arzaal can be spoken to. His gossip is different depending on whether the character uses the man'ari customization or not:
{{Dialogue|title=Non-man'ari customization|
Even with the corruption, this land is so... alive.

There is grass, water, unmarred skies. The air is so clean it almost hurts to breathe.

If any demon threatens this place, I will be the first to destroy them.}}

{{Dialogue|title=With the man'ari customization|
The Prophet says you have been doing good work on behalf of the [[Penitents]].

Thank you. The trust you foster will help us serve the draenei in the future.

{{Gossip|What have you and the other Penitents been doing?}}
{{Dialogue-child|
For the time being, we are aiding the [[krokul]] and [[Lightforged draenei|lightforged]] on [[Argus]]. Few have been allowed to serve the draenei here on [[Azeroth]].

I personally evaluate every Penitent and vouch for them on my own life, so it is not a matter of distrust.

Rather, it is that we have no desire to distress the draenei with our open presence. They are aware of the hand the Prophet has extended to us, but that does not erase what we did to them.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}}}

Hatuun can also be spoken to:
{{Dialogue|
I do not like this place.

It is too open. Too empty. Not enough places to set your back against.}}

Turn in to Velen, after which he has new gossip:
{{Dialogue|
The satyr are an infection we have allowed to fester in Bloodmyst for too long.

If we can push them back enough that they no longer pose an immediate threat to Azuremyst during the Tishamaat, I will see to a more permanent solution afterward.}}
