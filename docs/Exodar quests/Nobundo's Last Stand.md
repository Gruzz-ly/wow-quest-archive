==Objectives==
Defend [[Farseer Nobundo]] from the Legion Assault.
* Speak to Nobundo to begin the assault
*First Assault defeated (0/100%)
*Second Assault defeated (0/100%)
*Third Assault defeated (0/100%)
* [[Karzak the Impaler]] slain

==Description==
The [[Exodar]] shook from the force of the [[Burning Legion|Legion]]'s arrival. Before we could react, [[demon]]s were running rampant through the halls, slaughtering everything in their path. If it were not for the [[Velen|Prophet]], we would have all perished in the initial assault.

I was charged with evacuating the [[Crystal Hall]], which is when my [[Broken]] and I were separated from the main force.

We fell back into the collapsed hall to make our last stand.

With your aid, we may survive this invasion.

==Progress==

==Completion==
You have my thanks, and the gratitude of the Broken, hero. Many would have considered us an acceptable loss, yet you have shown us great compassion and kindness. An act that I - we - will not soon forget.

Now we will return to the [[Vault of Lights]] and assist Velen as best we can.
