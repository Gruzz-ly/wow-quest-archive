==Objectives==
Help [[Grand Artificer Romuul|Romuul]] finish repairing the [[Holographic Emitter]].
*[[Empyrium Filament]]
*[[Hyperthermal Soldering Tool]]
*Materials brought to Romuul
*Arkonite Array connected (2)

==Description==
[[Velen|The Prophet]] wished to personally ask for your help with the [[Tishamaat]]. But since he is working elsewhere, I asked you first to jumpstart our task.

My colleague and I have been working on a special project. And since the Prophet has declared today the Tishamaat, we will unveil it at the celebration!

For this, I need the emitter, but it needs an overhaul. We only have time for a hot wiring.

Get some filament and a soldering tool from the crates nearby, <name>. Then maybe I can wire it to an array.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40}}
*6,800 [[XP]]
*10x [[Flightstones]] (max level)

==Progress==
I regret not having apprentices in times like this.

==Completion==
<Romuul gives the newly seated crystal a test wiggle.>

Not my finest work, but it will do.

Light willing, it will remain functional until our project is revealed and the celebration is over.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|Were you not informed of the occasion? The Prophet has declared we celebrate the Tishamaat--today!}}

The required items are nearby. Loot the Empyrium Filament from the [[Artificing Tools]] boxes.{{Co|58.02|80.07|Exodar}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|You might recall the Tishamaat was a yearly sacrament on [[Argus]].}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|A time to reflect on the burdens of your past, learn from them, and commit to a path forward.}}

Take the Hyperthermal Soldering Tool from another set of Artificing Tools boxes.{{Co|51.42|74.73|Exodar}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|It has not been celebrated in many years.}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|But the Prophet feels strongly the tradition must be revived. And that now is the correct time to do it.}}

Return back to Romuul and speak with him:
{{Dialogue|While the circumstances are a bit more stressful than I would like, it is refreshing to work on something other than artillery for once!

{{Gossip|quest=|<Hand the materials to Romuul.>}}}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|Our project is fitting for the Tishamaat. That is why Velen has asked us to present it to everyone at the celebration.}}
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|But we will present nothing if the emitter is not fixed. Connect the arkonite crystal arrays. Perhaps then it will power up.}}

{{Dialogue|{{Gossip|Why did we abandon the Tishamaat for so long?}}
{{Dialogue-child|The same reason many of our ancient traditions were abandoned.

Constantly being on the run from the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] left little time to consider anything but survival.

Tomorrow was not guaranteed, so yesterday might as well not exist.

Ah, but all that has changed now! What could be more exciting?

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}
{{Gossip|Where is the Prophet?}}
{{Dialogue-child|Prophet Velen is, ah, occupied at the moment.

He is taking care of a very small mission that he wanted to attend to personally. Nothing to worry about!

He assured me that he will be back in time for the ceremony.

{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}}}}}

Near Romuul are four [[Arkonite Pillar]]s. Activate them, then the [[Arkonite Generator]].
:{{Text|say|Grand Artificer Romuul|Ah good, the emitter is functional. Now we just need the presentation--and its presenter.}}
