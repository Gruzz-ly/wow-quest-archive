==Description==
Hm.

There is one who has been counted amongst our number, but is not here.

The [[Lightforged draenei|Draenei]].

<Madam Shadow inhales.>

I can taste the [[Light]] about him. Go, see to it that he rejoins us.

There is much work to be done.

This view reminds me of... many things.

Now to appease our mysterious patron...

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Madam Shadow|Tick tock! Tick tock!}}

Head to the [[Darkmoon Boardwalk]] to find Oman sitting on the edge.

;Speaking with Initiate Oman
:Ah, good to see you again <race>.

:{{Gossip|quest=|Madam Shadow requests your presence.}}
::I am certain she does.

::See that wreck out there? Mine are a people born of wreckage and ruin. The [[Xenedar]] on [[Argus]]. The [[Genedar]] on [[Draenor]]. 

::The [[Exodar]] on [[Azeroth]].

::And each time, the Light preserves us. Not all of us. Just a fraction.

::Just enough to continue on.

::But I wonder if there might be another way. Not in opposition to the Light, but alongside it. You asked me, earlier, why I am here.

::This is my answer.

::Because I survived the wreckage of my people, and I am determined to become stronger for it.

::{{Gossip|quest=|I'm supposed to make you a soulstone.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|And that you shall.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|Do me a favor, <ace>. As a friend in the making.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|Create your soulstone, but cast it yourself. Not from some damp tome.}}

Use the [[Soulstone]] ability.
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|You have my thanks, <name>.}}
