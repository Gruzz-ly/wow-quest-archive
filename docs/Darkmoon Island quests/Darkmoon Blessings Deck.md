==Objectives==
Return the [[Blessings Deck]] to the [[Darkmoon Faire]] when it comes to town.

==Description==
Now that you have gathered all of the Blessings cards together into a deck, a ninth card mysteriously appears with the same backing as the first eight. On this card is inscribed, "Return these cards to the [[Darkmoon Faire]] and be rewarded." You have heard that the entrance to this faire appears near [[Mulgore]] and [[Goldshire]] every month.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Darkmoon Card: Crusade}}
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Darkmoon Faire (faction)|Darkmoon Faire]]

==Progress==
I see that you have managed to complete a deck of Blessings!   Congratulations!

==Completion==
So you have put together a deck of Blessings.   Your gesture of returning it to us will create a tie between you and the Darkmoon that will not soon be forgotten.   Allow me to present you with one of the greater Darkmoon cards as a small token of our appreciation.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.3.0|note=Description slightly updated:|comment=You have heard that this faire alternately stops at Mulgore and Goldshire every few months, so you will have to wait until they are here next.}}
*{{Patch 2.1.0|note=Added.}}
