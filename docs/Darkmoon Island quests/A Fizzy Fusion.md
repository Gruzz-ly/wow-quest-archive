'''A Fizzy Fusion''' is a monthly quest that can be completed during [[Darkmoon Faire]].  You must have 75 [[alchemy]] skill to complete.

==Objectives==
Use the [[Cocktail Shaker]] to combine [[Moonberry Juice]] and [[Fizzy Faire Drink]] to create 5 servings of [[Moonberry Fizz]].
* [[Moonberry Fizz]] (5)

==Description==
I'm sure you've made a lot of potions in your time as an alchemist. How would you like to help with something a bit more light-hearted?

I've always wanted to try creating a fruit-flavored version of our popular fizzy drinks. If you're willing to give it a try, you can buy some of the base drink from me and mix it with some moonberry juice.

Any innkeeper in Elwynn Forest or Mulgore should be able to sell you enough juice to make your creation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1x [[Darkmoon Game Token]]
*4x [[Darkmoon Prize Ticket]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkmoon Faire (faction)|Darkmoon Faire]]
*5 skill points in [[Alchemy]]

==Progress==
How's that moonberry fizz coming?

==Completion==
Your creation looks promising. With any luck, we'll soon have a new favorite!

Thanks for your help!

==Notes==
The closest NPCs to sell [[Moonberry Juice]] are {{npc|alliance|Innkeeper Farley}} in [[Elwynn Forest]] or {{npc|horde|Kuruk}} in [[Thunder Bluff]].
