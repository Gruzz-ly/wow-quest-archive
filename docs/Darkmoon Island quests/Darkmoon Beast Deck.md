==Objectives==
Return the Beasts Deck to the [[Darkmoon Faire]] when it comes to town.
*[[Beasts Deck]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that you have gathered all of the Beast cards together into a deck, a ninth card mysteriously appears with the same backing as the first eight. On this card is inscribed, "Return these cards to the Darkmoon Faire and be rewarded." You have heard that the entrance to this faire appears near [[Mulgore]] and [[Goldshire]] every month.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Darkmoon Card: Blue Dragon]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Darkmoon Faire (faction)|Darkmoon Faire]]

==Progress==
I see that you have managed to complete a deck of Beasts!   Congratulations!

==Completion==
So you have put together a deck of Beasts.   Your gesture of returning it to us will create a tie between you and the Darkmoon that will not soon be forgotten.   Allow me to present you with one of the greater darkmoon cards as a small token of our appreciation.
