==Objectives==
Teach the initiates curses from [[Madam Shadow]]'s grimoire in the [[Darkmoon Faire]].
*[[Initiate Telubi|Teach Curse of Weakness]]
*[[Initiate Springtotem|Teach Curse of Exhaustion]]
*[[Initiate Ko|Teach Curse of Tongues]]
*Find [[Initiate Oman]] in the Darkmoon Faire.

==Description==
The wheat has been separated from the chaff. Now the fun can truly begin.

I have an exciting... field trip... planned for our students. But they are not yet ready. Take my grimoire and have the [[Initiate Ko|pandaren]], [[Initiate Telubi|zandalari]], and [[Initiate Springtotem|tauren]] try their hand at [[curse]]s.

I found some uninvited guests loitering on the edges of our fairground. They should make excellent, if unwilling, test subjects.

Oman will have the honor of summoning the group far afield, and I will instruct him as such.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We have much to discuss.

==Completion==
It worked! That grimoire of Madam Shadow's really is powerful...

I hope I didn't startle you, <name>.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Madam Shadow|What do you know of summoning demons, draenei?}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|I have... un-summoned my fair share.}}

Head to the Darkmoon Carousel with [[Captive Cultist]]s and find the three initiates reading [[Madam Shadow's Grimoire]]s.

;Initiate Telubi
:This book is heavy... and damp?

:Reminds me of [[Nazmir]].

:{{Gossip|quest=|Shall we try "Curse of Weakness"?}}

:''Telubi casts the curse on a cultist.''
:{{Text|say|Captive Cultist|Getting... very... sleepy.}}
:''The cultist is transformed into a [[Emulsified Cultist]].''
:{{Text|say|Initiate Telubi|By the [[Loa]]!}}

;Initiate Springtotem
:The power... I feel it flowing through my hands! Through the book!

:{{Gossip|quest=|Look up "Curse of Exhaustion".}}

:''Springtotem casts the curse on a cultist.''
:{{Text|say|Captive Cultist|Muscle... turning... to pudding...}}
:''The cultist is transformed into a [[Mutilated Cultist]].''
:{{Text|say|Initiate Springtotem|... that felt incredible. My soul feels... lighter?}}

;Initiate Ko
:<Wary gas mask noises.>

:{{Gossip|quest=|Cast "Curse of Tongues".}}
:{{Text|say|Captive Cultist|Mmmffpphh! Mmmfffpphh!}}
:''The captive explodes.''
:{{Text|say|Initiate Ko|<Horrified gas mask noises.>}}

After the third spell is learned, the following message appears:
:Initiate Oman is attempting to summon you.

:Do you wish to accept?

Accept it to be teleported to the Mechafun Arcade.
