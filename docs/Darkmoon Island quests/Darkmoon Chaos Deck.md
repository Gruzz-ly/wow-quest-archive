==Objectives==
Return the Chaos Deck to the [[Darkmoon Faire]] when it comes to town.
*[[Chaos Deck]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that you have gathered all of the Chaos cards together into a deck, a ninth card mysteriously appears with the same backing as the first eight. On this card is inscribed, "Return these cards to the Darkmoon Faire and be rewarded." You have heard that the entrance to this faire appears near [[Mulgore]] and [[Goldshire]] every month.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Darkmoon Faire (faction)|Darkmoon Faire]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Darkmoon Card: Berserker!
}}

==Progress==
I see that you have managed to complete a deck of Chaos!   Congratulations!

==Completion==
So you have put together a deck of Chaos.   Your gesture of returning it to us will create a tie between you and the Darkmoon that will not soon be forgotten.   Allow me to present you with one of the greater Darkmoon cards as a small token of our appreciation.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.3.0|note=Description slightly updated:|comment=You have heard that this faire alternately stops at Mulgore and Goldshire every few months, so you will have to wait until they are here next.}}
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
