'''Baby Needs Two Pair of Shoes''' is a monthly quest that can be completed during [[Darkmoon Faire]].  You must have 75 [[blacksmithing]] skill to accept it.

==Objectives==
Use the [[Iron Stock]] to craft 4 [[Horseshoe]]s, then apply the Horseshoes to [[Baby]] at the Darkmoon Faire.
* [[Baby (horse)|Put New Horseshoes on Baby]]
* [[Iron Stock]] (provided)

==Description==
You may have seen my horse, Baby, over near the wagons.  She pulls the cart that hauls some of the animals in our [[Zoo Bizarre]].

She's a hard worker and she tears through shoes like you wouldn't believe.  It's about time for a new set.  I've already bought the raw materials.

All you need to do is shape them over an anvil and apply them to Baby's feet.  It's a quick job and worth some tickets, wouldn't you say?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=1|item1=Darkmoon Game Token
|q2=4|item2=Darkmoon Prize Ticket
}}

*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkmoon Faire (faction)|Darkmoon Faire]]
*5 skill points in [[Blacksmithing]]

==Progress==
How's old Baby doing?

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, <name>!  Here's the payment I promised.

==Notes==
The closest anvil is near [[Chronos]], east of the first pavilion you reach heading north from [[Yebb Neblegear]].
