==Objectives==
Talk to the newly arrived warlocks around the [[Darkmoon Faire]].
*Speak to New [[Warlock]]s (9)

==Description==
[[Assistant Phineas|Phineas]] did well in bringing you to me, <name>. There is much work to be done.

We'd best get to it!

As a master of the dark arts, I need you to help me whip these newcomers into shape. Talk to them. They come from many walks of life--all of them unfamiliar with the dark arts.

Learn their wishes.

Their hopes.

Their dreams.

This path we walk can bestow gifts unending and power unimaginable. One just needs to know what one truly desires...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|50}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you learned, <name>?

==Completion==
Only one or two pairs of cold feet, hm?

<[[Madam Shadow]] chuckles.>

Excellent.

Now that we know who wants to be here, it is time to determine who deserves to be here.

==Notes==
;Talk to [[Initiate Oman|Oman]]
:My name is Oman. I have travelled... a long way to be here. 

:<The [[lightforged draenei]]'s eyes glaze over for a moment.>

:This "Madam Shadow" character seems quite sure of herself. I cannot say the same.

:{{Gossip|quest=|We are about to start.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|I... will be there soon. I'd like to clear my head before introductions are made.}}

;Talk to [[Initiate Springtotem|Springtotem]]
:I come seeking answers, <race>. For a thousand generations my ancestors locked step with the land. Stewarded it. Shepherded it.

:Perhaps there is more.

:I inherited a great responsibility. It would be a grave mistake indeed to not explore every avenue of preserving our hold over [[Azeroth]]... and beyond.

:{{Gossip|quest=|What brings you to the Faire?}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Springtotem|Are we starting? Good. The shadows of this place grow tiresome.}}

;Talk to [[Initiate Gand|Gand]]
:My family wanted me to be a [[shaman]]. By the ancestors, they did! Day in and day out. From the moment I could hold a [[totem]].

:Only problem is, you can't be a shaman if the [[Elemental|elements]] don't play along.

:I have a cousin who's a [[Grimtotem tribe|Grimtotem]]. They have a certain... reputation, when it comes to this kind of thing. He encouraged me to accept Madam Shadow's offer. An easier path than one my elders could provide...

:{{Gossip|quest=|We are about to start.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Gand|Ah... controlling that beast is harder than Madam Shadow made it sound. Definitely more challenging than wrangling [[kodo]] in [[Camp Taurajo]].}}

;Talk to [[Initiate Undertide|Undertide]]
:This ritual circle should be working! Madam Shadow let me look at her grimoire, and these lines are an exact copy of those in the book-- but why won't the [[imp]]s obey me?

:Maybe I should have become a [[Tidesage]] like papa...

:{{Gossip|quest=|We are about to start.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Undertide|I'm going to try a couple more times. We don't appear to be running out of imps.}}

;Talk to [[Initiate Darkleaf|Darkleaf]]
:I see the question in your eyes, <race>. A [[night elf]]? Here?

:Reserve your judgment.

:We all seek power for our own ends. Do not confuse the tragedies of my people for my own ambition.

:{{Gossip|quest=|We are about to start.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Darkleaf|I suppose I don't really know why I'm here. Just that... I am.}}

;Talk to [[Initiate Roland|Roland]]
:Whoah, pal! We weren't doin' nothin' wrong here. It's... alright, it's exactly what it looks like.

:A warlock's gotta eat though, am I right?

:{{Gossip|quest=|We are about to start.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Roland|You can tell "Madam Shadow" she can keep this lousy campsite to herself. Time is money, and I'm fresh outta both.}}
:''Roland starts walking away. A pair of [[Fel Hunter (Darkmoon Island)|Fel Hunters]] stops him.''
:{{Text|say|Initiate Roland|What the..?!}}
:''They kill him.''

;Talk to [[Initiate Ko|Ko]]
:<Cautious gas mask noises.>

:{{Gossip|quest=|We are about to start.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Ko|<Excited gas mask noises.>}}

;Talk to [[Initiate Jim|Jim]]
:Are you insinuating I'm not meant to be here? That I'm not a warlock? That I accidentally summoned the wrong portal and stepped through without double checking where it might lead?

:Because that would just be stupid.

:{{Gossip|quest=|We are about to start.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Jim|You know what, I can hold it. I think I, er, left the hearth going back home. Yes! Yes of course. I need to leave. I need to get out of here!}}
:''Jim runs westward but is stopped by a pair of Fel Hunters.''
:{{Text|say|Initiate Jim|By the [[light]]!}}
:''They kill him.''

;Talk to [[Initiate Telubi|Telubi]]
:[[Zandalari troll|My people]] have had a -- complicated -- relationship with warlocks. For us, it is as much a question of politics as it is the pragmatic pursuit of power.

:When I heard Madam Shadow's summons, it struck me as an opportunity to further my own goals without all of the... baggage.

:A shortcut, of sorts.

:{{Gossip|quest=|We are about to start.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Telubi|I'll be along in a moment, friend. As soon as [[Nervous Brutosaur|Jayya]] finds his feet again!}}
