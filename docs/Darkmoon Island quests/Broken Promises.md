==Objectives==
Find someone at the [[Darkmoon Faire]] that might be interested in the ring.

==Completion==
Ah, I see that you've found my lovelies. Beautiful, aren't they? It's a shame that the process drives them so... insane.

The ring is yours to keep, of course. Can you hear them whisper? Marvelous.
