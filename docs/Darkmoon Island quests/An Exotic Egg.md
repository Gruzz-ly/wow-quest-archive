Bring the Monstrous Egg to [[Yebb Neblegear]] at the [[Darkmoon Faire]] on [[Darkmoon Island]]. 
* [[Monstrous Egg]]

==Description==
You're not certain what kind of creature this egg harbors, but it sure doesn't look like the egg of any ordinary animal.

The [[Darkmoon Adventurer's Guide]] says that an intrepid [[adventurer]] might come across any number of strange eggs in <his/her> travels.  It further notes that the Darkmoon Faire's [[Zoo Bizarre]] is always interested in acquiring such specimens.

Take the egg to Yebb Neblegear at the Darkmoon Faire.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||93}} (at lvl 90)
* [[Darkmoon Prize Ticket]] (10)
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkmoon Faire (faction)|Darkmoon Faire]]

==Progress==
What is it you have there? 

==Completion==
Where did you find this egg?  There's sure to be something monstrous and wonderful inside!  It will make a great addition to our zoo.  Are you willing to part with it for a generous number of Darkmoon tickets?
