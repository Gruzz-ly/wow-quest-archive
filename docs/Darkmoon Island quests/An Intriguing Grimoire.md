==Objectives==
Bring the [[:Mysterious Grimoire]] to {{NPC||Sayge}} at the [[Darkmoon Faire]] on [[Darkmoon Island]].
*[[Mysterious Grimoire]] (provided)

==Description==
This massive spellbook reveals very little of its origins. Its pages are filled with a variety of spells and enchantments, only a few of which are familiar.

The Darkmoon Adventurer's Guide says the tome may be of some interest to Sayge, the famous gnoll fortuneteller at the Darkmoon Faire.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Darkmoon Prize Ticket]] 
*[[XP]] (or {{cost||90}} if completed at level 90)
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkmoon Faire (faction)|Darkmoon Faire]]

==Progress==
What is it you have there? 

==Completion==
A strange grimoire, how interesting! I don't think I've seen its like before. I'd love to have it for my collection. Would you be willing to accept Darkmoon tickets in exchange? 

==Patch changes==
