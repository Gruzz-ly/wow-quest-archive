==Objectives==
Defeat Christoph VonFeasel in a pet battle.
*Defeat [[Christoph VonFeasel]]

==Description==
Look at me, now look at my horse, now look back at me, are I not the most impressive battler of pets that you have ever seen?

Look now at [[Jeremy Feasel (NPC)|my compatriot]] over there. Is he on a horse? Of course not! Is his hat made of fireworks? Not in a million years! Everything about me is more impressive, from my coat color to my last name, which I made myself.

Dare you step up to the might of Christoph Willikens Dennis Ragnaros VonFeasel the First?

I can see you trembling!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Greater Darkmoon Pet Supplies]]
*{{cost|15|40|lcgf=2}} (at level 90)

==Progress==
Ready, eh? Put up your cat's tiny dukes!

==Completion==
Next time I won't go so easy on you!
