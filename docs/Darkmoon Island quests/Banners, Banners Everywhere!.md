'''Banners, Banners Everywhere!''' is a monthly quest that can be completed during [[Darkmoon Faire]].  You must have 75 [[tailoring]] skill to complete.

==Objectives==
Use [[Coarse Thread]], [[Red Dye]], and [[Blue Dye]] with a [[Darkmoon Banner Kit]] to make a Darkmoon Banner, then set it up in a pile of [[Loose Stones]] on the grounds of the Darkmoon Faire.
* Plant Darkmoon Banner
* [[Darkmoon Banner Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
Isn't it wonderful to see Darkmoon banners everywhere? It's my favorite part of setting up, but we have so many old and tattered ones that need to be replaced.

If you've some skill with a needle and thread, would you mind making a banner from this kit and putting it up in some loose stones scattered around the grounds of the faire?

It's missing a few pieces, but you should be able to get what you need from any trade goods vendor in Elwynn Forest or Mulgore.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=1|item1=Darkmoon Game Token
|q2=4|item2=Darkmoon Prize Ticket
}}

You will also receive:
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkmoon Faire (faction)|Darkmoon Faire]]
*5 skill points in [[Tailoring]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find a place for that new banner of yours?

==Completion==
Thanks for helping with those banners. You have quite a talent for needlework. Next time the Darkmoon Faire's in town, why not come by and help again?

==Notes==
The closest NPCs to sell [[Coarse Thread]], [[Red Dye]] and [[Blue Dye]] are {{npc|alliance|Tharynn Bouden}} in [[Elwynn Forest]] or {{npc|horde|Shadi Mistrunner}} in [[Thunder Bluff]].  The nearest pile of [[Loose Stones]] is immediately in front of {{npc|neutral|Selina Dourman}}.
