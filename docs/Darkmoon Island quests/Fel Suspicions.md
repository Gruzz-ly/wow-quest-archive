==Objectives==
Spy on [[Madam Shadow]] and [[Assistant Phineas]] in the [[Darkmoon Faire]].
*Cast [[Eye of Kilrogg]]
*Spy on Madam Shadow and Phineas

==Description==
At the risk of stating the obvious, something very wrong is going on.

I know you feel it too.

Madam Shadow is sending myself and the other initiates to the [[Altar of Storms (Burning Steppes)|Altar of Storms]], to try our hand at summoning [[demon]]s. Please, <name>, poke your head around here and see if you can't piece together what she's up to.

I saw her and her servant heading towards the back of the faire... I'm sure she has her guard up. Maybe there's some way you can get close without drawing attention to yourself?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|5|25}}
* 2,050 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The gate is warm to the touch.
