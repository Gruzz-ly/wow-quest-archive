==Objectives==
Help [[Oman]] fill [[Madam Shadow]]'s [[:soulstone]] on [[Darkmoon Island]].
*Dummy soulstone created for Madam Shadow
*Return to Madam Shadow in the [[Darkmoon Faire]].

==Description==
Thank you for indulging me.

But I do not want to appear unappreciative of our new... mentor. Do me a favor--go and fill Madam Shadow's soulstone by some other means. Far be it for us to test our teacher, but she has yet to earn my trust.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|10|50}}
*4,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Ah, the prodigal warlock returneth.

The Madam Shadow's Soulstone extra action button is available again. Use it on a [[Rat (critter)|Rat]] or a [[Sea Gull]] on the boardwalk.
