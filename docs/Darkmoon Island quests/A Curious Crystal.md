==Objectives==
Bring the Imbued Crystal to Professor [[Thaddeus Paleo]] at the [[Darkmoon Faire]] on [[Darkmoon Island]]. 
* [[Imbued Crystal]]

==Description==
Power swirls inside this strange crystal. Perhaps it was once a magical focus, an energy source, or simply a good luck charm. There's no way to know for certain.

The [[:Darkmoon Adventurer's Guide]] indicates that the crystal would be of interest to Professor Thaddeus Paleo at the Darkmoon Faire.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|16|54}} (at max lvl)
* [[Darkmoon Prize Ticket]] (10)
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkmoon Faire (faction)|Darkmoon Faire]]

==Progress==
What is it you have there? 

==Completion==
Where did you get this crystal?

These are very rare and much sought-after by collectors. I would like to study this one and display it at the Faire. Would you accept a generous number of Darkmoon Faire tickets in trade?
