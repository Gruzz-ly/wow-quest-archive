==Objectives==
Bring the Banner of the Fallen to [[Professor Thaddeus Paleo]] at the [[Darkmoon Faire]] on [[Darkmoon Island]].
*[[Banner of the Fallen]] (provided)

==Description==
This tattered banner bears a faded guild crest. This old banner must've seen more than its share of battles.

Professor Thaddeus Paleo of the Darkmoon Faire collects banners and other relics of combat and he might be interested in acquiring this one. Show the banner to him next time you visit the Darkmoon Faire.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|19|84|50}} (at max lvl)
* 5x [[Darkmoon Prize Ticket]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Darkmoon Faire (faction)|Darkmoon Faire]]

==Progress==
What is it you have there?

==Completion==
What a splendid banner! I'd love to have it for my collection.

Would you be willing to trade it for some Darkmoon tickets?
