I saw a green flicker in their eyes as they fell, one by one. Like the very essence of their souls were being drawn forth.

They deserved better.

==Notes==

:Who knows what lies beyond?

:{{Gossip|quest=|Step through the portal.}}

On the other side at the [[Altar of Storms (Burning Steppes)|Altar of Storms]], Initiate Ko, Initiate Springtotem, Initiate Telubi, and Initiate Oman are found dead, killed by demons - [[Untethered Felstalker]]s, [[Untethered Imp]]s, [[Untethered Impling]]s, [[Untethered Voidwalker]]s, [[Fel Bodyguard]]s, [[Brooding Fel Bat]]s, and [[Monstrous Fel Bat]]s.

Proceed to the corpse of Oman and attack and subjugate the [[Vengeful Subjugator]].

:''A small explosion occurs and the demon disappears.''

Interact with the corpse of Oman, which brings him back to life.
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|Hnngh... by the Light... my head! My eyes! They burn...}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|<Name>? You're here! Your soulstone... haha!}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|Hahaha!}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|My apologies. I think I'm in shock.}}
:{{Text|say|Initiate Oman|We must get someplace safer...}}
:''Oman runs away.''

Follow him to the small camp at the entrance.
