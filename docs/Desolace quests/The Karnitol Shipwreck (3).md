==Objectives==
Find Karnitol's Satchel and return it to Kreldig Ungor in Desolace.
*[[Karnitol's Satchel]]
*[[Recovery Diver's Potion]] (provided)

==Description==
Intriguing.

Well, we might not be without hope quite yet.

Along that same coast, but to the north near [[Ranazjar Isle]], there're night elf ruins at the bottom of the ocean. A tribe of [[naga]], the Slitherblade, make that their home. I think that'd be our best bet.

If a scouting party went that far south, then they must've been pretty powerful. If you're gonna find Karnitol's belongings, I'd start with the more powerful naga: the tidehunters or sea witches.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Karnitol's Leftover Robe
|Treads of the Seeker
|Finder's Battleaxe
|Claimant Treads
}}

You will also receive:
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
No offense to whoever [[Nijel]] is, but this camp ain't the most comfortable place I've spent a night, if you know what I mean, <name>.

==Completion==
This is great, <name>! You found Karnitol's belongings!

Those blasted naga, always causing trouble. I think I'd rather spend my life at war with the [[Horde]] than have to go against their kind. You've done a great service to the [[Reclaimers Inc.|Reclaimers]].
