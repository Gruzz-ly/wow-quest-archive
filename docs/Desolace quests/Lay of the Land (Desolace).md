==Objectives==
[[Captain Pentigast]] wants you to speak to [[Vahlarriel Demonslayer|Vahlarriel]] in [[Nijel's Point]]. 

==Description==
Yes, yes. Welcome to [[Desolace]], <race>.

Sorry we had to be so insistent, but we're a small outpost, and there are big problems in this region - most of them quite urgent.

Bottom line. We need all the help we can muster.

To start with, our friend Vahlarriel over there has been getting pretty antsy, insisting that we send a contingent to visit the [[Sargeron|ruins to the east]].

Why don't you go introduce yourself....

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||2|50}}
*245 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A pleasure to meet you, <class>.

==Progression==
{{Nijel's Point}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
