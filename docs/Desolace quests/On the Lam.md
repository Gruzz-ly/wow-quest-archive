==Objectives==
Find one of the {{C|Desolace}} [[marauder]]s.

==Description==
I've found a couple of scenes like you describe, <name>. Always camps of [[human]]s and [[Dwarf|dwarves]]. Rumor among the [[caravan]]s is a group of [[Horde]] marauders did it. Seems likely given the victims, and how brutal the attacks were.

Apparently the [[bandit]]s fled Desolace once an [[Alliance]] [[Marshal (rank)|marshal]] got hot on their trail.

If you're looking to track one of 'em down, I'd check in a port town. Those always have shady characters coming and going. Might catch one trying to get a boat to somewhere.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1550 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You need something? Make it quick.

==Progression==
{{Highway Robbery}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 1.15.1|note=Added.}}
