==Objectives==
Bring 10 Kodo Bones from the [[Kodo Graveyard]] to [[Bibbly F'utzbuckle]] at [[Kormek's Hut]].
*[[Kodo Bone]] (10)

==Description==
We're sitting on a goldmine here, I tell you - a goldmine!  Kodo bones will change the world forever... I have customers making furniture, music instruments, and even blasting powder out of them.

There's a caravan that comes by and picks up my kodo bones and then sells them at [[Shadowprey Village]].  If you can travel to the kodo graveyard south of here and bring me ten kodo bones, I'll give you something in return.  Is it a deal?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2250 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Ratchet]]
* [[Kodobone Necklace]]

==Progress==
Do you have the bones?  The caravan will be here any moment.  I need just ten more Kodo bones to reach a career high.  A career high, I tell you!

==Completion==
Ah, goodie!  My bones!

I can't wait till the chaps at home see my face on the front cover of Goblin'peneur.  I'll be the richest goblin in the world... and my physical education teacher said I would never amount to anything.

==Notes==
The bones are looted by opening the Kodo Bones chest-like items around the [[Kodo Graveyard]] which look like a kodo skull on the ground.  Some of them are trapped and spawn a level 38 (sometimes 39) [[Kodo Apparition]] that will attack you.
