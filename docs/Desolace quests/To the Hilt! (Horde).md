==Objectives==
You are to collect 20 [[Satyr Saber]]s from the weapon racks and various [[satyr]]s in the region, then place them upon the statue, [[Elune's Handmaiden]].
*Elune's Ritual of War Completed

==Description==
You immediately recognize this statue from a sketch in [[Furien]]'s [[Furien's Journal|Journal]].

Though the words associated with the entry elude you, the sketch seems self-explanatory. After battle, the enemies' weapons were to be cast upon the basin in exchange for a divine gift of some sort.

As you ponder this ritual, the glint of steel catches your eye from a nearby weapon rack....

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sandals of Ritual
|Gilt Cuirass
|Profound Girdle
}}

You will also receive:
*2540 [[XP]] (or {{cost||15}} at max level)

==Progress==
The statue stands expectantly.

==Completion==
With the ritual completed,  you are awarded a divine gift.

You can't help but wonder what [[Elune]] would think of someone such as you receiving one of her boons.

==Notes==
This quest is available after completing [[Translation]].
