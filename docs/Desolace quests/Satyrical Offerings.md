==Objectives==
You are to collect 10 pieces of Satyr Flesh from the various [[Satyr]]s in [[Sargeron]], and place them on [[Elune's Brazier]].
*Sacrificial Offering Accepted
*[[Satyr Flesh]] (10)

==Description==
You find it most amusing to think that this ancient relic is bestowing upon you a blessing meant for your enemies.

You determine to make as much as you can of this unintentional gift.

==Rewards==
The following spell will be cast on you:
:[[Divine Endowment]]

==Completion==
The divine brazier indiscriminately endows you with a blessing. 

==Notes==
This is the repeatable version of the previous quest, [[Ten Pounds of Flesh]]. It is possible to maintain the buff throughout the entire playthrough of [[Desolace]] as long as the player is willing to re-farm [[Satyr Flesh]] when it needs a refresh.
