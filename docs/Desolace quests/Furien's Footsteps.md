==Objectives==
The [[Ancient Tablets]] at the Shrine of Elune have directed you to visit three of the prominent ruins in [[Sargeron]].
*Elune's Cathedral Ruins Visited
*Elune's Temple Ruins Visited
*Elune's Sanctuary Ruins Visited
*[[Furien's Journal]] (provided)

==Description==
You can decipher bits and pieces of the text, but it will require extensive study before [[Furien]]'s work becomes coherent.

For now, as you look off to the northeast, you think you can make out some of the ruins depicted in the journal.

From what you can tell, these ruins seem to have been of some significance to Furien's research.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2450 [[XP]] (or {{cost||15}} at level 85)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Completion==
It is clear to you now that these ruins are those that Furien recorded in his journal.

After examining the engravings upon the ruins themselves, you feel that you are able to decipher more of Furien's writings.
