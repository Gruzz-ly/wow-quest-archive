== Objectives ==
Visit [[Elune]]'s Relics in [[Sargeron]].
* [[Elune's Handmaiden|Handmaiden Of Elune]] Visited
* [[Elune's Brazier]] Visited
* [[Cup of Elune]] Visited

== Description ==
Simply intolerable!

[[Satyr]]s of all things, desecrating our sacred lands...

Their days are numbered, <race>. I can assure you of that. As soon as we have the numbers, I shall lead a charge that will rid this land of the wicked creatures.

For now, though, perhaps you could put my mind at ease?

Travel just east of here to Sargeron and scour the ruins. Find the relics of Elune and ensure that they are in good condition.

I'll pay you well for this favor. 

== Completion ==
The relics are intact! Well, indeed, that is something.

You have put my mind at ease, <race>. Please accept this as my gift to you.

== Notes ==
The three items Vahlarriel has you visit offer quests of their own that mainly concern the satyr of [[Sargeron]] and the surrounding area, [[To the Hilt! (Alliance)]], [[Ten Pounds of Flesh (Alliance)]], and [[Nothing a Couple of Melons Won't Fix (Alliance)]], so consider doing those before turning this in.
