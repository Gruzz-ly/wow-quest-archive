== Objectives ==
Felgur Twocuts wants you to destroy 10 Lesser Infernals.
*Lesser Infernals Destroyed (10)

== Description ==
The demons are on the move, <race>!

If nothing is done, we'll be overrun in a matter of weeks. I've just returned from Mannoroc Coven, where the infernals there are falling from the sky!

We need to at least buy ourselves some time. Get down there and pick up where I left off!

== Completion ==
Well done, <race>!

The danger persists, but you have bought us some time.
