==Objectives==
Kill Kohor.
*[[Kohor]] Slain

==Description==
We are a forward post, charged with monitoring potential adversaries. Once the [[Alliance]] launches its [[Desolace]] campaign, our work here will ensure that there are no surprises.

Recently, one of our [[scout]]s was caught and sacrificed by the [[Burning Blade]] at their stronghold to the west. Since then, we've been assaulted with threats and taunts from a Burning Blade wretch named Kohor.

Their days here are numbered, but I will pay handsomely for that one to be silenced now!

==Completion==
It is done.

[[Captain Pentigast]] should be able to sleep in peace now that Kohor's threats have been silenced.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|2500}} (+{{coppercost|1500}} at max level)

==Notes==
Find [[Kohor]] on the south side of the [[Thunder Axe Fortress]] and defeat him to complete the quest automatically.

Kohor has this to say on his death:
:{{text|yell|Kohor|Muahhaah! You are far too late. The summoning of your doom is nearly complete!}}
