You are to bring 25 Burning Blade Ears to [[Sorrem]] at [[Furien's Post]].
*[[Burning Blade Ear]] (25)

==Description==
Sorrem has made no secret of his disdain for the [[Burning Blade]] at [[Thunder Axe Fortress]].

Surely, proof of their demise would be of value to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30}}
*2540 [[XP]] (or {{cost||15}} at max level)

==Progress==
What have you there, <class>?

==Completion==
Ears of the Burning Blade?

<Sorrem smiles.>

Well done, <class>. This is just a shadow of what will soon become of that vile cult!
