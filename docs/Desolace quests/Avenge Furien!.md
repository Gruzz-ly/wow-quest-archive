==Objectives==
[[Cerelia]] wants you to speak with [[Sorrem]] at [[Furien's Post]].

==Description==
This cannot be!

[[Furien|My dear brother]] - slain by [[Alliance]] scum!

They must be made to suffer, <race>! Find a way to bring them pain! I shall not rest until it is so...

Furien had been researching ancient artifacts in the eastern regions before his death. Speak to [[Sorrem]]. Perhaps he can direct you in my brother's footsteps.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*245 [[XP]] (or {{cost||1|50}} at level 85)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Completion==
Furien's passing is... regrettable.

I shall do all that I can to assist you in avenging his death.
