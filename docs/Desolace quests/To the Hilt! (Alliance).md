Collect 20 [[Satyr Saber]]s from the weapon racks and various [[satyr]]s in the region.
*[[Elune]]'s Ritual of War Completed

==Description==
The handmaiden of Elune! It's even more glorious than the stories tell.

The legends surrounding this relic come to your mind as you draw near it:

In ancient time, after battle, the enemies' weapons were to be cast upon the basin in exchange for a divine gift of some sort.

As you ponder this ritual, the glint of steel catches your eye from a nearby weapon rack....

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Sandals of Ritual|Gilt Cuirass|Profound Girdle}}

You will also receive: {{coppercost|0}} (+{{coppercost|1500}} at max level)

==Progress==
The statue stands expectantly.

==Completion==
With the ritual completed, you are awarded a divine gift.

You can't help but wonder what Elune would think of someone such as you receiving one of her boons.
