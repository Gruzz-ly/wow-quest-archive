==Objectives==
You are to collect 10 pieces of [[Satyr Flesh]] from the various [[Satyr]]s in [[Sargeron]], and place them on [[Elune's Brazier]].
* Sacrificial Offering Accepted

==Description==
According to [[Furien]]'s [[Furien's Journal|Journal]], this ancient brazier was placed here for the performing of sacrifices.

As far as you can make out from the entry, a blessing is bestowed upon the being who places the flesh of [[Elune]]'s enemies on the brazier's burning embers.

Looking around, you determine that the satyrs who now possess this region would likely qualify.

==Progress==
The brazier silently awaits an offering.

==Rewards==
The following spell will be cast on you:
:[[Divine Endowment]]

You will receive:
*15400 [[XP]] (or {{cost||15}} at max level)

==Completion==
The divine brazier indiscriminately endows you with a blessing.

==Notes==
[[Furien's Footsteps]] guides players to this quest, but it is available after completing the previous quest, [[Translation]].
