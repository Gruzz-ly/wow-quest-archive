==Objectives==
Use the Raging Vortex Gem at [[Nijel's Point]] Ruin. While commanding your firestorm, kill 40 [[Nijel's Point Defender]]s and burn 15 [[Nijel's Point Merchant]]s. The location of Nijel's Point Ruins is the archway in front of Nijel's point, if you place mouse pointer on the arch it will say the name. There are no indicators that show up on your map. 

Should you lose your Raging Vortex Gem, you may acquire another from the [[Ancient Vortex Runestone]].
* [[Nijel's Point Defender]] Slain (40)
* [[Nijel's Point Merchant]] Slain (15)
* [[Raging Vortex Gem]] (provided)

==Description==
You cannot help but to feel a twinge of pride, having unlocked this long lost secret of the ancient worshippers of [[Elune]].

You now possess the power to inflict great damage upon your enemy.

As it was [[Furien]]'s tireless work that made this possible, it only seems right that the weapon should be unleashed upon those who took his life.

The [[Alliance]] scum at [[Nijel's Point]] shall pay for their offenses against the [[Horde]]!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Tranquility of Furien

You will also receive:
*{{cost||60}}
*3150 [[experience]] (or {{cost||19|20}} at level 85)

==Completion==
Very impressive, <class>.

You completed Furien's work and rained vengeance down upon his killers.

You have brought peace to my brother's soul, and to my mind. Please accept this gift for your diligence.
