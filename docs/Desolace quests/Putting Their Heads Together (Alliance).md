==Objectives==
Collect 100 [[Bleached Skull]]s from [[Thunder Axe Fortress]], place them at the [[Burning Blade]] Summoning Circle, then kill [[Nazargen]].
*[[Nazargen]] slain

==Description==
So it's true....

The parchment you discovered in Thunder Axe Fortress details a powerful summoning ritual. One stronger than the Burning Blade have ever been known to possess.

Clearly, this rite must be stopped at all costs!

Perhaps if this demon were summoned forth prematurely the crisis could be averted.

==Completion==
You diverted what would have been a serious crisis, <class>.

If that summoning was delayed just a bit longer, the demon would have become far too powerful for our small forces here to contend with.

Please accept this gift as our thanks for your service. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Grounding Choker|Ring of Vigorous Interruption|Skull-Scorched Cloak}}

You will also receive: {{coppercost|6000}} (+{{coppercost|1920}} at max level)

==Notes==
Each Bleached Skullpile in the area contains roughly 15 Bleached Skulls. Collect 100, then use the stack to summon [[Nazargen]] and defeat him.

This completes the "Nijel's Point" portion of [[Desolace Quests]].
