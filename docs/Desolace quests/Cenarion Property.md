== Objectives ==
Collect 7 Cenarion Supply Crates from the [[Magram Territory|Magram Lands]].
*[[Cenarion Supply Crate]] (7)

== Description ==
Since the demons have invaded their lands, the [[Magram]] have broken all ties with any outsiders.

They are untrusting and hostile and have taken to stealing from others instead of providing for themselves.

Many of our needed supplies have gone missing of late and we suspect that the Magram are to blame.

Please, <name>, go to their lands in the east and search for our belongings.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

== Progress ==
Were you able to find our belongings, <name>? 

== Completion ==
As we suspected, the Magram have been stealing our supplies.

We shall guard them more closely.

==Progression==
