==Objectives==
Bring three Tamed Kodos and the Kodo Kombobulator back to [[Smeed Scrabblescrew]] at [[Scrabblescrew's Camp]].
*[[Tamed Kodo|Kodos Tamed]] (3)
*[[Kodo Kombobulator]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Bibbly F'utzbuckle|Bibbly]] thinks he is the only goblin in [[Desolace]] who knows how to make money.  Well, the only caravan brave enough to travel these parts relies on me.  Ever since I learned how to rejuvenate and control [[Aged Kodo|aged]] and [[Dying Kodo|dying]] kodos with my [[Kodo Kombobulator|kodo kombobulator]], the caravan owner, [[Cork Gizelton|Cork]], [[Rigger Gizelton|Rigger]], and I entered a partnership.

Take the [[Kodo Kombobulator|kombobulator]] and use it on any [[Ancient Kodo|ancient]] or [[Aged Kodo|aged]] kodos: it will jolt the beast into a [[Tamed Kodo|tamed kodo]] and force it to follow you.  Once you have a kodo tamed, bring it back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*4405 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Ratchet]]

==Progress==
The caravan will be here shortly; do you have the newly tamed kodos I was asking for?

==Completion==
<[[Smeed Scrabblescrew]] begins counting.>

Three, excellent, I ask for three [[Tamed Kodo|tamed kodo]]s and I get three [[Tamed Kodo|tamed kodo]]s... I am going to be rich... yes, very rich! I hope to see the look on [[Bibbly F'utzbuckle|Bibbly]]'s green face when he hears about my success!
