== Objectives ==
Kill the [[Magram Warden]] at the [[Magram Territory|Magram Village]]{{Sic}}.
*[[Kolkar Prisoner]]s Freed{{Co|71.4|55.9|Desolace}}

== Description ==
It began with a dream that repeatedly warned me of the danger to come. I saw the demonic legions bearing down upon our kind, overrunning our lands.

The dream has become real. The [[Burning Blade]] and their demon masters have pushed the [[Magram]] out of their lands in the south. In turn, the Magram have defeated my people and taken over our homes.

The fight was ferocious. Only a handful of the Kolkar still live. I would ask that you visit what was once my land in the east, and free them from their prison.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
Have my people been freed, <race>?

== Completion ==
I thank you, <race>.

Our tribe may not have survived without your aid. 

==Notes==
Pick up [[Cenarion Property]] before heading out. The [[Magram Warden]] is located just south of [[Magram Territory]], guarding a pen full of [[Kolkar Prisoner]]s. Killing the Warden causes the Prisoners to immediately run off to freedom.

==Progression==
