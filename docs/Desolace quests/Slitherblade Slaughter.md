==Objectives==
[[Cenarion Researcher Korrah]] at Ethel Rethor wants you to collect 10 Slitherblade Bones from [[Slitherblade Naga]], 30 Slitherblade Scales from [[Slitherblade Sorceress]]es, and 4 Slitherblade Fins from [[Slitherblade Warrior]]s.
* [[Slitherblade Bones]] (10)
* [[Slitherblade Scale]] (30)
* [[Slitherblade Fin]] (4)

==Description==
Time and again, the [[naga]] have proven to be enemies to the balance of [[nature]]. I have no qualms with the spilling of their blood.

Your best efforts though, would barely put a dent in their forces here. Where one falls, two seem to rise in their place.

I have a plan, <class>. Your objective is not merely to take the lives of the enemy, but to gather components necessary for the next stage of our investigation....

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3350 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
Have you collected the components I require?

==Completion==
You have done well, <class>.  But I'm afraid that your work here is just beginning.

<Korrah casts a spell on the naga components.>

==Progression==
