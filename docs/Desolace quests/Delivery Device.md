==Objectives==
{{NPC||Maurin Bonesplitter}} wants you to collect 3 Hollow Kodo Horns from [[Dying Kodo]].
*[[Hollow Kodo Horn]] (3)

==Description==
As fate would have it, there's a special deed that needs doing - one that will benefit the [[Cenarion Circle]] as well as myself.

You see, <class>, I am under pressure to create a special... concoction, shall we say. I believe my work to be complete, but I need to have it tested to be certain.

The target of this test is to be the [[naga]], who threaten this region from the west. Their demise would surely aid the Circle.

First though, I need a delivery device. Hollow horns from the dying [[kodo]] should do nicely. 

==Progress==
Back so soon, <class>? 

==Completion==
Yes, yes.

These will do nicely.... 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

==Progression==
{{Cleansing our Crevasse (Horde)}}
