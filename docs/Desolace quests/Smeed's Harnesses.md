==Description==
Pardon me, young <race>.

I'm in need of a little help. I've just finished filling an order for harnesses that must be delivered right away.

I'm a bit old for the trip, especially considering how dangerous things have become lately.

Would you mind?

They need to go to Smeed, a goblin who lives just southeast of here.

Ahh, my harnesses!

Thanks, friend!
