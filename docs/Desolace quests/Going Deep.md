==Objectives==
[[Cenarion Researcher Korrah]] at [[Ethel Rethor]] wants you to speak to [[Valishj]].
*[[Slitherblade Charm]] (provided)

==Description==
I have fashioned a charm that will allow you to infiltrate the [[naga]], giving you the appearance of one of their own.

With this disguise, you will be able to speak and understand [[Nazja|their language]]. They will be unable to discern your true identity.

But beware! The [[shark]]s and other sea creatures here will expose you for all to see. Avoid them at all costs.

Now go. Speak to the Priestess of [[Azshara]] and do what you must to learn of their purposes here. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1,350 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Completion==
Don't just stand around, when there is so much to be done!

Must I instruct everyone on each detail?

==Progression==
