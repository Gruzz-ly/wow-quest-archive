==Objectives==
Banish 6 Portals at [[Mannoroc Coven]] and return to [[Taiga Wisemane|Felgur Twocuts]] at [[Shadowprey Village|Ghost Walker Post]].
* Portals Banished (6)
* [[Hand of Iruxos]] (provided)

==Description==
Here it is - the Hand of Iruxos.

Got it from one of the Burning Blade leaders myself.

You must possess it if the demon portals at Mannoroc Coven are to be banished... which is what I now ask you to do.

With the demon threat increasing we must close these portals to stem the tide of demons to this world.
