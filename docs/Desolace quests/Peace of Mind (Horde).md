== Objectives ==
[[Sorrem]] at [[Furien's Post]] wants you to kill [[Kohor]].
* [[Kohor]] Slain

== Description ==
We are a forward post, charged with monitoring potential adversaries. Once the [[Horde]] launches its [[Desolace]] campaign, our work here will ensure that nothing takes us by surprise.

Recently, one of our scouts was caught and sacrificed by the [[Burning Blade]] at their stronghold to the east. Since then, we've been assaulted with threats and taunts from a Burning Blade wretch named [[Kohor]].

Their days here are numbered, but I will pay handsomely for that one to be silenced now!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||25}}

== Completion ==
It is done.

Sorrem should be able to sleep in peace now that Kohor's threats have been silenced.

== Gains ==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*2450 [[experience]] (or {{cost||15}} at level 85)

==Progression==
{{Peace of Mind (Horde)}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
