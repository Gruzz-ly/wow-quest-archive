==Description==
An ornate broken warhammer lies surrounded by dead [[Burning Blade]] Cultists and [[Scarlet Crusade]] warriors. A fight clearly happened here, and fairly recently. You also recognize this as the weapon of a [[paladin]] of the [[Order of the Silver Hand]]. While you've seen many hammers like this one, the quality and worksmanship of this weapon is fairly unique. You should search the area for clues, and find someone who may know more about this weapon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2350 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What is it you have there, my friend?

==Completion==
<Katherine sighs heavily> Yes <name>, I do know of this weapon. I'd assumed its owner had died long ago.
