== Objectives ==
Defeat Agogridon.
*[[Agogridon]] Defeated{{Co|82|80.61|Desolace}}

== Description ==
Our goal is within sight, <name>!

We can break the will of this demon army by bringing down the one who leads them. If we can succeed, Desolace will be ours!

When you are ready, lead a group of centaurs through the pass to the south, into [[Shadowbreak Ravine]]. Find where Agogridon hides!

I will gather the other [[khan]]s and meet you there to face him in battle.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Cutlass of Agogridon
|Soulstar Mace
|Kolkar Cleaver
|Kolkar Polearm
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||40|}}
* 1,750 [[XP]]
* +700 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]
* +10,000,00 reputation with [[Magram Clan Centaur]]
* +10,000,00 reputation with [[Gelkis Clan Centaur]]

== Completion ==
Agogridon is no more.

The demons shall never again take hold in our lands! 

==Notes==
[[File:Death to Agogridon aftermath.jpg|thumb|The three khans in Shok'Thokar.]]
After accepting, speak to Leh'Prah again to get the same warband of NPCs (a [[Centaur Commander]], a [[Centaur Windchaser]], and three [[Centaur Mauler]]s) as in [[Into the Fray!]]:
:{{Gossip|I am ready! I want to join in the battle!}}

Head to the top of Shadowbreak Ravine, where [[Agogridon]] awaits. On approach, Khan Leh'Prah appears and immediately starts fighting Agogridon:
:{{Text|yell|Khan Leh'Prah|Sons of [[Cenarius|Cenarion]], UNITE!}}

Immediately after, [[Khan Kammah]] and [[Khan Shodo]] appear and also join the fray. After Agogridon is killed, the khans spread out to survey the area. Turn in to Leh'Prah. Upon completion, the khans run down the path and despawn. Back in Shok'Thokar, all of the Burning Blade forces have been killed and the village is now populated by [[Centaur Guardian]]s, with the three khans standing together at the central tent.

Completing this quest concludes the "Uniting the Tribes" chapter of [[Desolace Quests]].

Khan Shodo offers [[The Wilds of Feralas]], an optional breadcrumb to the [[Feralas storyline]].
