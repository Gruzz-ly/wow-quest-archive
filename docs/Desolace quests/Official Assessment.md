You have accomplished much in your efforts against the [[naga]], <name>. But I fear it is not nearly enough....

This is my official assessment of the naga presence.

I'm confident that my peers in the wildlands will take the necessary action.

Bring this to Karnum at the grove in the center of the [[Cenarion Wildlands]] to the southeast. He will know what to do.

Thank you, <name>. And farewell.

==Completion==
<Karnum opens and reads Korrah's Report.>

This is alarming news, indeeed,{{sic}} <race> - something we have no shortage of here.

I shall call a council regarding the issue. You will be summoned if you are needed.
