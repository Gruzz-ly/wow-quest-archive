Because of your deeds, we stand here together fighting a common foe. We shall win our ancestral lands back from these demons, or we shall die as brothers.

What of you, <name>?

You have earned the right to fight alongside us. I have a group of my best centaurs for you to lead into battle.

Will you take up the spear?

You will receive: {{cost||35}}

== Completion ==
Well done, <name>!

Let us finish this! 

==Notes==
[[File:Into the Fray! - Warband.jpg|thumb|The player's warband.]]
After accepting, speak to Leh'Prah again:
:Steady yourself, friend...
:These next hours shall determine the fate of our clans.
:{{Gossip|I am ready! I want to join in the battle!}}

This puts the player on the back of a [[Centaur Commander]], accompanied by a warband of four NPCs: three [[Centaur Mauler]]s and one [[Centaur Windchaser]]. The Commander has the following abilities:
#{{Abilities|Throw|id=68669|Throws your weapon at an enemy, inflicting 900% of normal weapon damage.|icon=inv_weapon_halberd_03}}
#{{Abilities|Attack Order|id=68672|Orders your centaur units to attack the target.|icon=achievement_bg_kill_flag_carrierwsg}}
#{{Abilities|Return Order|id=68676|Orders your centaur units to leave combat.|icon=achievement_bg_returnxflags_def_wsg}}
#{{Abilities|Request Healing|id=68680|Orders your centaur casters to heal you.|icon=spell_nature_healingwavegreater}}
#{{Abilities|Call for Reinforcements|id=68668|Calls for additional centaur units to assist you in battle.|icon=inv_misc_head_centaur_01}}

The Maulers and Windchasers will automatically attack any nearby enemies. If they get themselves killed, the player can summon new ones with "Call for Reinforcements".

The player can skip talking to Leh'Prah and manually fight the Burning Blade without any NPC aid, though this makes the quest significantly tougher.
