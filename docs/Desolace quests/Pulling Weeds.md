==Objectives==
Kill 7 Uprooted Lashers.
*[[Uprooted Lasher]]s Slain (7)

==Description==
With such an abrupt change to the ecology, it is to be expected that some of the flora and fauna don't react as well as we'd hope.

The uprooted lashers are a troublesome example of this. Roaming the fields to the east and south they are a detriment to the region and must be disposed of.

While you're about, please deal with any of these pests that you find.
