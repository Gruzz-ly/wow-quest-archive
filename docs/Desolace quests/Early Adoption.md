==Objectives==
Place 3 Swoop Eggs in [[Swoop Nest]]s and protect them until they are collected.
*Swoop Egg Protected (3)
*[[Swoop Eggs]] (provided)

==Description==
As the region becomes more lush, the creatures of the desert are being forced into increasingly confined spaces.

A particularly distressing result is the impending extinction of the local [[swoop]]s. Predators feast on the birds and their eggs when they take nest.

I have acquired some swoop eggs from [[Tanaris]] and coated them with an irresistible pheromone. Place one in each nest you find, then protect it until a swoop comes to carry it off.

You will be doing a service to the balance of this land.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||30}}

{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Featherlight Leggings|Collector's Padded Gauntlets}}

==Completion==
You have done well, <class>.

This land is in your debt.

==Notes==
*When the eggs are placed in a nest, hostile [[Snapjaw Basilisk]]s or [[Famished Bonepaw]]s will appear.
