==Objectives==
[[Cenarion Researcher Korrah|Korrah]] wants you to speak to her when you are ready to be shown the [[naga]] threat.
* Naga Forces Scouted

==Description==
I am all that remains of my company, sent to monitor the many changes on this coast of [[Desolace]].

I have reported of the dramatic increase of naga here, but to no effect.

My [[Cenarion Circle|peers]] are focused on other crises, so I must ask you, a stranger, to assist me in my research.

First, though, allow me to show you the threat we face. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Now you see, <race>.  This is not a matter to be taken lightly.

==Completion==
So now you see.  These are not a simple band of displaced naga, but a well organized army, capable of great devastation.

Do you agree to assist me in my investigation?
