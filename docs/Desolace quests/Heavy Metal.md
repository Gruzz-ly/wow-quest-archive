==Objectives==
You are to collect 7 pieces of Element 116 and bring them to [[Bizby]] at Bizby's Caravan.
*[[Element 116]] (7)

==Description==
You have a strong feeling that this stone is somehow responsible for the region's refusal to accept the encroaching regrowth.

Looking off to the west, you notice a trail of smoldering debris that appears to be related to this mystery.

You surmise that clearing the debris might assist [[Cenarion Embassador Thunk|Thunk]]'s efforts here.

And who knows what this stuff might be good for?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||60}}

==Progress==
Whatcha got there, <class>? 

==Completion==
What's this?

<Bizby examines the ore.>

Wahoo! I know someone who will be most interested in acquiring these samples.

Most generous in payment for them as well, I'll wager.

Here, <class>. Take this as your finder's fee.
