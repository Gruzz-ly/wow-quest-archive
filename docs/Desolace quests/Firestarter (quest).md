==Objectives==
You are to create a Raging Vortex by defeating 7 [[Disciple of Elune|Disciples of Elune]] in the presence of your firestorm.

Should you lose your Vortex Gem, another can be obtained from the [[Ancient Vortex Runestone]].
*Raging Vortex Created
*[[Vortex Gem]] (provided)

==Description==
You are now able to understand the script in which the [[Furien's Journal|journal]] was written.

Along the runestone, it is explained that the momument's gemstones were imbued with the power to summon a firestorm.

The storm could grow to be a mighty weapon either through sustained worship of [[Elune]], or charged by spiritual energies of the fallen.

Looking down upon the newly revealed ghosts of Elune's disciples, you reason that you have neither the time, nor the inclination to worship the goddess of your enemy....

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2540 [[XP]] (or {{cost||15}} at level 85)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Completion==
It is done! [[Furien]]'s exhaustive research was not in vain.

The raging Vortex is ready to be unleashed upon your enemies at last!
