== Objectives ==
{{npc||Cerelia}} at [[Furien's Post]] wants you to speak to {{NPC||Cenarion Researcher Korrah||Korrah}} at [[Ethel Rethor]]. 

== Description ==
We have plenty of enemies in this region without raising the ire of the [[Cenarion Circle]].

When we established our post here, we were asked to keep a watch over one of their researchers.

Korrah was last seen at the tower to the west. Do be a dear and pay her a visit. It's been some time since we've bothered to check on her.

== Completion ==
It is good that you have come.

There is grave danger looming here.
