==Objectives==
Report to [[Officer Jankie]] at [[Tethris Aran]] in [[Desolace]]. 

== Description ==
I've received a disturbing message from Nijel's Point in Desolace. It would seem as if the great upheaval has created some new problems for them, which they are ill-equipped to handle. I was given no further information.

Report to Office Jankie in Desolace. She will direct you to Nijel's Point.

Good luck, <name>.

== Completion ==
Hold there, stranger! 

==Progression==
{{Nijel's Point}}
