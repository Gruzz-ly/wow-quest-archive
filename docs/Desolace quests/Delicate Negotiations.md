==Objectives==
[[Khan Leh'Prah|Khan Leh'prah]]{{Sic}} wants you to place the Spear of the Kolkar Khan in the [[Fatherstone]] and defend it from the [[Magram]] until [[Khan Kammah]] appears.

Speak to Khan Leh'prah when you are ready to ride to the battle site.
*Will of the Magram Broken{{Co|71|45.5|Desolace}}
*[[Spear of the Kolkar Khan]] (provided)

==Description==
There is but one way to win the trust and loyalty of the Magram.

It must be beaten out of them.

They have suffered many losses in their war against [[Kolkar clan|my clan]]. They now possess an unfamiliar land, where they struggle just to feed themselves.

Now is the time to strike.

Speak to me when you are ready, then ride in and plant my spear in the Fatherstone. If we can kill enough of them, their Khan will submit to our will.

==Notes==
[[File:Spear of the Kolkar Khan.jpg|thumb|The Spear of the Kolkar Khan.]]
After accepting, speak to Leh'Prah again:
:{{Gossip|I am ready to do battle with the Magram clan!}}

This puts the player on the back of a [[Kolkar Centaur]], who automatically rides out of [[Karnum's Glade]] and up the road to the [[Fatherstone]] in the middle of [[Magram Territory]]. He then circles around the stone until the player uses the "Place Spear" ability.
:{{Text|say|Kolkar Centaur|Now, <race>! Place the spear!}}
:{{Abilities|Place Spear|id=68385|Places the Spear of the Kolkar Khan in the Fatherstone.|icon=inv_spear_08}}

Placing the spear automatically dismounts the player. A ring of [[Kolkar Warmonger]]s appears around the stone while waves of [[Magram Defender]]s rush at the stone from all directions.
:{{Text|yell|Kolkar Centaur|Kolkar clan! Attack!!}}

Most of the Magram are intercepted by the Kolkar, but a few will inevitably slip through and need to be killed by the player before they damage the Spear of the Kolkar Khan to the point of destroying it. If the spear is destroyed, the Kolkar call off the attack and run out of the village, and the player will need to go back to Leh'Prah to restart the attack.
:{{Text|emote|The Spear of the Kolkar Khan has been broken...}}
:{{Text|yell|Kolkar Warmonger|Retreat!}}
:{{Text|yell|Kolkar Warmonger|The spear has been broken! Retreat!}}

After the player has successfully defended the spear against enough enemies, [[Khan Kammah]] appears at the bottom of the hill, causing the Kolkar Warmongers to scatter.
:{{Text|yell|Khan Kammah|Enough! What is this about?!}}

Turn in to Kammah.
