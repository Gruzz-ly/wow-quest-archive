==Objectives==
[[Bizby]] at Bizby's Caravan wants you to find 15 Aged Basilisk Tails.
*[[Aged Basilisk Tail]] (15)

==Description==
I need a crateload of tail, <class>! And not just any kind of tail. The tail I'm after needs to be old - ancient even. The more decrepit the better.

The scales of a basilisk's tail are unique in that they harden with age without becoming brittle. The hardened scales are ideal for the production of certain armors.

It's been many years since I've been reduced to peddling lizard scales, but who knows, maybe it'll build even more character in me! If that's even possible....

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||30}}

==Progress==
How's the search for tail coming, <name>?

==Completion==
A few more friends like you and I'll be back on my feet in no time!
