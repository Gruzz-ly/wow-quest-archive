==Objectives==
Find the Ancient Summoning Ritual in [[Thunder Axe Fortress]].
*[[Ancient Summoning Ritual]]

==Description==
With his dying breath, [[Kohor]] mentioned the summoning of a [[demon]] that could threaten the [[Desolace|entire region]].

He may have been bluffing, but that's not a chance worth taking.

This cannot wait for the [[Alliance]]'s invasion of Desolace to take shape. You must scour Thunder Axe Fortress for clues and bring an end to this potential threat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||30}}
*2540 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The [[Burning Blade]] must not be allowed to succeed with their plan!

==Completion==
It is most fortunate that you took the time to search for this.

No one would have expected the Burning Blade to be in possession of something so powerful!

==Notes==
Head up to [[Thunder Axe Fortress]] and enter the smaller of the big buildings. In the big room is a chest that contains the [[Ancient Summoning Ritual]]. Loot it to complete the quest automatically.

While in the area, players may end up killing a member of the Burning Blade and start [[Ears Are Burning (Alliance)]], an optional side quest.

==Progression==
