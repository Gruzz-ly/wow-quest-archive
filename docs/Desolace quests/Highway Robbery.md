==Objectives==
Find someone in {{C|Desolace}} who knows about the pillaged campsite.

==Description==
The campsite before you is a grisly scene. Judging by the remains, the victims were two humans and a dwarf. Markings on the bones indicate a savage attack, but the looted supplies tell you this wasn't done by an animal. The wounds don't match [[centaur]] weaponry either.

Perhaps an experienced scavenger of these lands would know what to make of this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1550 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, so you found another one...
