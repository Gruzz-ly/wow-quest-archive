==Objectives==
[[Kherrah]] wants you to speak with [[Khan Leh'Prah|Khan Leh'prah]]{{Sic}}.

==Description==
<Kherrah listens to you as you explain recent events.>

I agree with the words of the [[Kolkar]] [[Khan]]. The time for ancient grudges is over. It is a shame that it has taken a demonic crisis to unite the tribes.

I shall return to my father and convince him to join your cause. You have my word that he will comply.

Return to Khan Leh'prah{{Sic}} and inform him that the [[Gelkis]] will be ready when called upon.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Silent Footpads
|Emissary's Chestpiece
|Wrought Formal Dagger
|Messenger's Greaves
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Completion==
You have done well, <race>.

And not a moment too soon....

==Notes==
Leh'Prah has relocated to the northern outskirts of [[Shok'Thokar]]. The area has entered a special phase, with [[Centaur Warmonger]]s fighting the [[Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade]] forces in the area while many of the buildings have been set on fire.

==Progression==
{{Magram centaur Khan Leh'Prah}}
