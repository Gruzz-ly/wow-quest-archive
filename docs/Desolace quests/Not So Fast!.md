== Objectives ==
Khan Shodo wants you to kill 10 Maraudine Maulers in the Valley of Spears.

You are to search their corpses for clues to Kherrah's whereabouts.
*[[Maraudine Mauler]]s Slain (10)

== Description ==
<The Khan of the Gelkis clan stares at you with an empty gaze as you detail the demon threat and [[Khan Leh'Prah|Leh'prah]]'s visions.>

It matters not to me what becomes of this land now. I have failed my clan and my forefathers....

There is but one thing left in this world that might bring my old soul hope, and she's likely dead as well.

My precious daughter, [[Kherrah]], was taken from me by the [[Maraudine clan]]. If you can bring her back to me alive, I shall consider your proposal.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

==Progress==
Have you discovered my daughter's whereabouts, <race>?

== Completion ==
As you slaughter their enemy, the Gelkis clan cannot help but to acknowledge your prowess.

==Notes==
The first Maraudine Mauler killed by the player will drop [[Maraudine Prisoner Manifest]], which automatically starts [[Behind Closed Doors (Desolace)]].

==Progression==
