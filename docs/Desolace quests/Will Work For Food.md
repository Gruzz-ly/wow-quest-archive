== Objectives ==
Collect 5 Basilisk Flanks.
*[[Basilisk Flank]] (5)

== Description ==
<Khan Kammah listens as you explain the demonic threat, and [[Khan Leh'Prah|Khan Leh'prah]]'s visions.>

No one need lecture us about the [[demon]]s, <race>. It is they who drove our clan from our [[Shok'Thokar|ancestral lands]].

It is they who forced us to take over the [[Magram Territory|Kolkar wastelands]], where we struggle just to exist.

The war against the [[Kolkar clan|Kolkar]] took a heavy toll on my people. What few of us remain are weary and hungry.

Bring food for my people and then we shall discuss the demons.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||35}}

== Progress ==
Have you brought food for my clan, <race>? 

== Completion ==
Very good, <race>.

This will sustain us for now.

==Progression==
{{Magram centaur Khan Leh'Prah}}
