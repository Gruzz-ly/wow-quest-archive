==Objectives==
[[:Furien's Journal]] has directed you to find the ruined Palace of Elune in northern [[Sargeron]].
* Ruins of Elune's Palace Located

==Description==
Something has changed... perhaps a side-effect of [[Elune]]'s cleansing ritual.

While it's by no means perfect yet, your understanding of the ancient language in the journal has vastly improved.

The ruins in the northern mountains of Sargeron appear to be the main focus of [[Furien]]'s enthusiasm. Something there, he felt, would aid him in driving the [[Alliance]] from this region.

You close the journal determined to find this ruin and discover its secrets.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1900 [[XP]] (or {{cost||11|40}} at level 85)
*+150 [[reputation]] with {{F|Silvermoon City}}

==Progress==
This appears to be the ruin depicted in Furien's Journal.

==Completion==
It is clear to you now why you were guided here.

You recognize this ancient runestone from Furien's final journal entry:

"The ancients revered the gems created by this mystical object, claiming that they were gifts from the goddess herself. It was believed that they were weapons capable of delivering them from any enemy.
