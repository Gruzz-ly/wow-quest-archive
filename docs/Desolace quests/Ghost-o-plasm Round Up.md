==Objectives==
Bring 8 Ghost-o-Plasms and the Crate of Ghost Magnets to [[Hornizz Brimbuzzle]] in [[Desolace]].
*[[Crate of Ghost Magnets]] (provided)
*[[Ghost-o-Plasm]] (8)

==Description==
There's a valley to the southeast, the Valley of Bones, haunted by Magram ghosts. Sounds scary, doesn't it? Well think how scary it is to the Magram! If we captured [[Ectoplasm|ghost energy]] from that place, I bet it'd be worth plenty to those centaurs.

Here, take this crate of ghost magnets. If you place one between the two big skeletons in the valley, the [[Dead Goliath]]s, then ghosts will wander to it. Distance yourself, take out the ghosts and get their ghost-o-plasm—that's what we'll sell to the Magram.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Condor Bracers|Anchorhold Buckler}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost||45|}}
*2250 [[XP]] (or {{cost||13|80}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Where's my ghost-o-plasm, <name>?

==Completion==
There it is! Looks like you got some of it on you too. Kinda slimey, eh?

Well, thanks a lot for all the trouble, <name>. This stuff will be worth a fortune... if I can convince the [[centaur]]s what it is!

[[File:Crate of Ghost Magnets.jpg|thumb|The ghost magnet.]]
Horniz is just to the southwest of the [[Kodo Graveyard]]. Run east, then south to enter the [[Valley of Bones]] from the north (and not the west&mdash;[[Mannoroc Coven]] is a pain to get through). At the southern end of the valley are the two [[Dead Goliath]]s. Stand in between them and drop the [[Crate of Ghost Magnets]]. Then get a few yards away from it.

Initially neutral [[Magrami Spectre]]s will spawn and walk to the magnet.
:{{Text|emote|Magrami Spectre is drawn to the ghost magnet...}}

After a few seconds within 5 yards of the magnet, the spectres will turn hostile.
:{{Text|emote|Magrami Spectre is angered!}}

Kill them to loot their [[Ghost-o-Plasm]] then head back to Horniz.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 1.3.0|note=Reduced the speed at which the Magrami ghosts are attracted to the Ghost Magnet in the Ghost-o-plasm Round Up quest. Modified quest text to suggest players move away from where they place their magnet.}}
