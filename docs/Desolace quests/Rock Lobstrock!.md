==Objectives==
Get 7 Tender Lobstrock Tails.
*[[Tender Lobstrock Tail]] (7)

==Description==
Thargad works practically nonstop chasing after ancient Titan relics. He stays so busy that if it weren't for me, he'd probably forget to eat!

Speaking of eating, I'd like to prepare him something special - perhaps you could help me out?

[[Makrura|Lobstrock]] roam all over the coast to the west. I'd never last in a fight with them myself, but I could make a great meal if you were to bring me some of their tails!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35}}
*3100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to collect some lobstrock tails, <race>? 

==Completion==
Ohhh, these will do nicely!

Thargad will be so surprised!

==Progression==
{{Cleansing our Crevasse (Alliance)}}
