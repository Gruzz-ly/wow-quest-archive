We cannot afford to encounter any surprises as we advance our campaign to secure [[Desolace]].

See that Desolace is placed under the banner of the [[Alliance]].

[Lend Aid to Desolace] 

==Objectives==
Report to [[Officer Jankie]] at [[Tethris Aran]] in [[Desolace]].

==Description==
By order of his royal highness, [[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin Wrynn]], all able-bodied citizens of the [[Alliance]] are to report to Officer Jankie on the road into Desolace at Tethris Aran.

For the glory and honor of the Alliance!
