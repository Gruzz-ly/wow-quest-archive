==Objectives==
Assist [[Raszel Ander]] and [[Doan Karhan]] with the summoning ritual and trap Des'Altek inside the staff.
*[[Des'Altek]] slain

==Description==
You can see foul [[magic]] is poisoning the water, giving it a purple hue. The [[Burning Blade]] have overwhelmed this area with dark energy.

We shall use this Sacrificial Alter that they use during summoning rituals. We can harness the latent dark energy in the area to amplify our ritual.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||50}}
*[[Neverending Soul Vessel]]
*[[Rune of Synergy]]

==Completion==
For all things Raszel Ander was, commanding was not one of the traits I knew. For a [[warlock]], he was always on the meek side. I had a feeling something wasn't right when that imposter returned during your summoning ritual, which was why I sent for more acolytes to assist, but it wasn't enough... Once again we have failed to ensnare our prey.

Unfortunately, the staff shattered during your fight, and all I could do was stand by helpless and watch... but I found this in the destruction.

==Notes==
Talk to Raszel Ander to begin the ritual, then click on the [[Reconstructed Staff of Des'Altek]] to summon the demon. The process of channeling the ritual will deal shadow damage; use [[Shadow Ward]] to mitigate it. When the ritual is complete, Raszel will reveal himself as [[Des'Altek]], killing both [[Shadowbinder Acolyte]]s.
