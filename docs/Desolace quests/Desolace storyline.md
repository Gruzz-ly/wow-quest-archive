'''Desolace''' is a level 30 - 35 zone in western [[Kalimdor]] for both the [[Horde]] and [[Alliance]].

After that, they both come together with quests offered at [[Ethel Rethor]] and the [[Cenarion Wildlands]] before separating again with {{npc||Karnum Marshweaver}} sending alliance to [[Thargad's Camp]] and Horde players to [[Ghost Walker Post]] on the fringes of the Wildlands and [[Shadowprey Village]] on the southern coast.
