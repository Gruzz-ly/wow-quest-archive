==Objectives==
Valishj wants you to defeat 15 [[Servant of Neptulon (Desolace)|Servants of Neptulon]]. (You must be in [[naga]] form when you defeat them.)

If you lose your [[Slitherblade Trident]], speak to [[Valishj]].

If you lose your [[Slitherblade Charm]], speak with [[Cenarion Researcher Korrah|Korrah]] at [[Ethel Rethor]].
* Servants of Neptulon defeated (15)
* [[Slitherblade Trident]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Neptulon]]'s minions have arrived here and are doing all they can to thwart us. Clearly, they've discovered our motives.

This only confirms my suspicion that what we seek is indeed somewhere in these ruins!

These [[water elemental]]s are no match for our forces! Take this trident and use it to destroy the worthless servants of the Tidehunter.

When we find what we seek here, Neptulon himself shall fear for his life! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||30}}
*2710 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Tell me, minnow.  Have you done as I asked?

==Completion==
The enemy's ranks are thinning, little minnow.

Perhaps you are worthy of assisting in our search....

==Notes==
