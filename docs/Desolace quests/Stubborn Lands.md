== Objectives ==
Thunk at Thunk's Abode wants you to find the Unnatural Outcropping. 

== Description ==
By authority of the Cenarion Circle, I am charged with turning these harsh lands into lush prairie.

The lands south of here welcomed the growth, but something here is fighting back - resisting the replenishment.

Perhaps your eyes can succeed where mine have failed.

Please, <race>. Scour these lands and discover the source of the desert's stubbornness.

== Completion ==
You look around, scanning the horizon for what might be responsible for placing this stone here....
