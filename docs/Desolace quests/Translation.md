==Objectives==
[[Sorrem]] wants you to find the [[Ancient Tablets]].

Speak to [[Narimar]] at [[Furien's Post]] to ride to where [[Furien]] was known to study.
* [[Furien's Journal]] (provided)

==Description==
It is true that Furien dedicated his last days to a special research project. What that was, he would not share with me.

Fortunately, I was able to recover his journal, but it's written in a code that I cannot decipher.

Perhaps there is a clue to its translation in the region to the east where he spent his time.

Take the journal, <class>, and speak with Narimar when you are ready to investigate this mystery.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1200 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|20}} at level 85)
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Silvermoon City (faction)|Silvermoon City]]

==Completion==
Comparing the characters on the ancient tablet to those in Furien's Journal, it is clear that there is a distinct correlation.

==Notes==
Narimar is the flight master, just up to the left.
