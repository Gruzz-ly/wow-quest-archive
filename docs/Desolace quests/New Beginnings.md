==Objectives==
Collect 15 Scorpion Stingers.
* [[Scorpion Stinger]] (15)

==Description==
There's never been danger of centaur attack this far north before. Someone put 'em up to it, I just know it!

Regardless, I'm wiped out. I had everything invested in this haul.

Fortunately, there's one thing no centaur can take from me and that's goblin ingenuity! I'll start from scratch and build an empire!
