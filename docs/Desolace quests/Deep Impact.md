== Objectives ==
[[Priest]]ess [[Valishj]] wants you to find the Ancient Engravings of Neptulon.
* [[Slitherblade Staff]] (provided)
* [[Ancient Engravings of Neptulon]]

== Description ==
[[Queen Azshara]] seeks entrance into the plane of water, for what I do not know.

She believes that the ancients held the keys to finding its location.

I have personally been charged with scouring the ruins in this region, and none shall rest until we discover the secrets we seek!

Submerged just to the north are a concentration of ruins. Use this staff to search through the rubble.

Return to me only when you have located that which we seek! 

== Rewards ==
You will receive?
*{{Cost||30}}
*2710 [[XP]]
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Circle]]

== Progress ==
Could it be....?

== Completion ==
Yes!  You've found it!

[[Neptulon]]'s engravings... there can be no mistake!

== Notes ==
This is another 'vehicle' quest where your actionbar gets replaced.  For this quest, you just need key 4, Shatter Rubble, near Ancient Rubble objects on the seafloor. Break the rubble to spawn Ancient Tablet Fragment objects. Loot them to acquire either [[Ancient Tablet Fragment]]s or [[Illegible Tablet Fragment]]s. Four Ancient Fragments are requires to complete the quest.
