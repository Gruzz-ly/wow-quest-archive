==Objectives==
[[Sorrem]] at [[Furien's Post]] wants you to find the Ancient Summoning Ritual in [[Thunder Axe Fortress]].
*[[Ancient Summoning Ritual]]

==Description==
With his dying breath, [[Kohor]] mentioned the summoning of a demon that could threaten the entire region.

He may have been bluffing, but that's not a chance worth taking.

This cannot wait for the [[Horde]]'s invasion of [[Desolace]] to take shape. You must scour [[Thunder Axe Fortress]] for clues and bring an end to this potential threat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+2540 [[XP]] (or {{cost||15}} at max level)

==Progress==
The Burning Blade must not be allowed to succeed with their plan!

==Completion==
It is most fortunate that you took the time to search for this.

No one would have expected the Burning Blade to be in possession of something so powerful!

==Progression==
{{Peace of Mind (Horde)}}

==Patch changes==
