==Objectives==
Escort [[Melizza Brimbuzzle]], then speak with [[Hornizz Brimbuzzle]] at the [[Kodo Graveyard]] in [[Desolace]].
*Melizza Brimbuzzle escorted to safety

==Description==
Get me out of here!

I came up to the [[Valley of Spears]] to talk to the [[Maraudine]]s. I thought I could do a little business with them... but they don't want to talk! I think they want to eat me!

Get me out of here and my brother Hornizz will pay you big! He's at our camp next to the kodo graveyard, to the east.

Let's hurry, <name>. Not two minutes ago I heard some centaurs talking about getting wood for their cookpot...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||45|}}
*2250 [[XP]] (or {{cost||13|80}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have you seen my sister Melizza? She's always on the go, which gets her into trouble all the time.

==Completion==
My sister Melizza said you'd be coming. Thanks a lot for getting her out of the jam she was in; it's too bad that she's already probably found herself in a new one!

Clear the path coming in. Melizza has a ''fifteen minute'' respawn timer, travels at a walk and takes the shortest route out toward the [[Kodo Graveyard]]. There are two scripted spawn events:
# Four [[Maraudine Marauder]]s
# Three [[Maraudine Wrangler]]s and two [[Maraudine Bonepaw]]s.

The quest objective is just after the second spawn point.

:{{text|say|Melizza Brimbuzzle|We're going to have to scratch the Maraudines off our list. Too hard to work with...}}
:{{text|say|Melizza Brimbuzzle|Well, I'm off to the [[Gelkis clan|Gelkis]]. They're not as dumb as the Maraudines, but they're more reasonable.}}
