*[[Valishj]] Slain

==Description==
I am Hydronis, a servant of [[Neptulon]] the Tidehunter, Lord over all waters.

[[Queen Azshara|Azshara]] and her sinister [[naga]] have arrayed themselves against my master, and seek a war with him. This is the first battle in what shall surely be a long struggle.

I have fought bitterly, <race>, and have grown weary.

It seems that my actions here have attracted the attention of their priestess.

Alone, I haven't the strength to overcome her. but perhaps together, we may prevail.
