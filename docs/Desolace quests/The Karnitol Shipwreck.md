==Objectives==
Find [[Karnitol's Chest]] in [[Desolace]].

==Description==
Greetings, friend. Have yerself a seat here...

My first order of business is for the mage [[Karnitol]]--a noble of some sort in [[Stormwind]].  Seems his ship was attacked by sea giants while off the coast in the northwest of [[Desolace]].  He and his servants tried to bring one of his more valuable chests ashore, but when the sea giants attacked in droves, he chose to abandon it and teleport himself and his servants to safety.

He wants us to find the chest and its contents, and return it to him in [[Stormwind]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge]]

==Completion==
You notice the chest does not seem to have any water damage.

The second thing you notice is that the top has been forced open, and whatever magical traps were set to safeguard it have long been triggered—this much is obvious from the burn marks around its edges.

==Notes==
The chest is located in the [[Ethel Rethor]] section along the northern part of the coastline. {{co|36|30|Desolace}}
