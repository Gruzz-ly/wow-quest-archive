*[[Brendol's Satchel]]

==Description==
I'm too busy collectin' artifacts to busy myself with much else, but there is a bit of an issue here I wouldn't mind sortin' out.

There's a forsaken apothecary who's been pokin' around these parts for a while now. Normally, I'd ignore him, but three times now he's snuck into my camp and pilfered my supplies.... enough's enough!

Find the thief and bring me whatever's left o' my things!

==Progress==
Well, <class>? Did yeh find the cretin? 

==Completion==
Justice is done!

Now let's have a peek at what's left of my goods....
