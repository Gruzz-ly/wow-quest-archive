==Objectives==
[[Khan Kammah]] wants you to speak to [[Khan Leh'Prah|Khan Leh'prah]]{{Sic}}. 

==Description==
It would seem that we have no choice.

As reluctant as I am to cooperate with the [[Kolkar]], there is wisdom in the words of [[Khan Leh'Prah|their Khan]].

You may give him my word that we shall lend our spears to the battle.

==Completion==
You have done well, <class>.

Now we must convince the [[Gelkis]]... 

==Notes==
This concludes the "Karnum's Glade" chapter of [[Desolace Quests]]. The storyline continues with [[Three Princes]].
