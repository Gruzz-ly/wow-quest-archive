==Objectives==
Collect 10 Blood-filled Leeches.
*[[Blood-Filled Leech]] (10)
*[[Bottle of Leeches]] (provided)

==Description==
The land is not all that has changed in Desolace. Here, the wildlife has responded to their new environment in strange and sometimes exciting ways.

I am particularly interested in the [[Rejuvenated Thunder Lizard]]s that roam just to the west.

I need a sample of their blood.

You may begin helping me by using this jar of leeches on a few of them.

Once they've filled on the blood of those beasts, return them to me. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||35}}
*2,900 [[XP]]
*250 reputation with [[Cenarion Circle]]

==Progress==
Were you able to recover the samples I require? 

==Completion==
This should be enough.

Thank you, <class>.

==Notes==
*The Bottle of Leeches has a 30 yard range. Throw the bottle at a Rejuvenated Thunder Lizard to aggro. The thunder lizard will have the buff:
{{Effecttip
|name=Leech Infestation
|description=When killed, a blood-filled leech will crawl from the lizard's corpse.
|icon=inv_qiraj_ourohide
|etype=buff
|float=none

}}
*When the infested thunder lizard is killed, a {{rep|neutral}} leech will spawn from the corpse. Right-click the leech to loot it.
