==Objectives==
[[Sorrem]] at [[Furien's Post]] wants you to collect 100 [[Bleached Skull]]s from [[Thunder Axe Fortress]], place them at the [[Burning Blade Summoning Circle]], then kill Nazargen.
*[[Nazargen]] slain

==Description==
So it's true....

The parchment you discovered in Thunder Axe Fortress details a powerful summoning ritual. One stronger than the [[Burning Blade]] have ever been known to possess.

Clearly, this rite must be stopped at all costs!

Perhaps if this demon were summoned forth prematurely the crisis could be averted.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Grounding Choker
|Ring of Vigorous Interruption
|Skull-Scorched Cloak}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||60}}
*3150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||19|20}} at max level)

==Completion==
You diverted what would have been a serious crisis, <class>.

If that summoning was delayed just a bit longer, the demon would have become far too powerful for our small forces here to contend with.

Please accept this gift as our thanks for your service.

==Progression==
{{Peace of Mind (Horde)}}
