==Objectives==
Kill the Bound Tempest and Enthralled Tidefury.
* [[Bound Tempest]] slain {{co|59.9|41.4|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Enthralled Tidefury]] slain {{co|61.8|38.1|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
Sails... in the fog...

A light below... in the darkness.

Water rising... given form... the pain... 

AHHHH, THE PAIN!

Make it stop. Make it stop. Make the pain stop!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
I know Sam is unwell, but I think he's onto something.

==Completion==
Their rituals are growing bolder. Sooner or later they're going to summon something they can't control.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Storm Awakens]] before heading out. In the quest area, the bonus objective [[A Clean Slate]] is also available.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Taelia, <name>, this burden must be yours to bear. I will take Samuel and meet you by the Shrine as soon as we are able.}}

While in Sagehold proper, find [[Tideguard Victoria]] left for dead just outside a house. She offers [[Oathbound]].

==Progression==
