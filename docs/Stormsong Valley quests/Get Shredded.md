==Objectives==
Find an Energized Power Core and install it in the [[Prototype Shredder MK-03]].
* [[Energized Core]]

==Description==
I was scouting ahead while you were wreaking havoc in [[Saltstone Mine|the mine]].

Spotted a hulking, armored [[shredder]] in their lumber yard. Bet we could do some real damage with that thing!

I tried to start it up, but looks like it might be out of juice. Maybe they forgot to charge it?

See if you can grab a fresh power core from one of the other shredders nearby.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
<Energized Core required.>

==Completion==
<As the key clicks into place and the new core activates, a low hum begins emitting from the shredder. It accelerates into a high pitched whirring as the instrument panels light up all over the cockpit.>

==Notes==
Pick up [[Burn It All Down]] and [[Saw Dusted]] before heading out.

The flamethrower does not work on the [[Goblin Shredder]]s -- use standard abilities.

==Progression==
{{Cycle of Hatred}}

==Patch changes==
