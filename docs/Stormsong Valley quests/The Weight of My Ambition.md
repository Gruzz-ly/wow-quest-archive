==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Drowned Captain.jpg|Drowned Captain|Even in death, his crew obeys...}}
Defeat the Drowned Captain.
* [[Drowned Captain]]{{coords|79.2|43.4|Stormsong Valley}} slain

==Description==
As with the other settlements, I too relied on the services of sailors and watercraft to deliver supplies. They proved very useful in their diligence, and their silence.

Predictably, they drew the attention of enemies, including those below the waves. Their anchor was hexed, dragging them beneath the ocean before they could so much as cry out.

I have seen them, hoisting ethereal sails and singing shanties of the damned. If these waters are to be safe again, they must be silenced again. For good.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,310 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The poor devils, chained and drowning for eternity...

==Completion==
Finally, a sailor's death.

== Notes ==
When attacking the captain, there is a possibility of accidentally pulling a Drowned Crewman due to proximity.

His one ability of note is Boarding Grasp, in which an anchor plunges you to the bottom. This could be a concern if you cannot kill him in three minutes and have no means of [[Breath|water breathing]].
