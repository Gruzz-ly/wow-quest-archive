==Description==
Thundersnout is the largest of the [[boar]]s in the valley. She poses a serious threat to our troop movements in the south.

As such, Centurion Kaga Warmstone has issued a bounty for proof of her demise.

Thundersnout's location is near the [[Briarback Kraul|Briarback kraul]], so beware the [[Briarback tribe|local]] [[quilboar]]!

* +250 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]
