==Objectives==
Protect Kelsey Steelspark in [[Stormsong Valley]].
* [[Kelsey Steelspark|Kelsey]] defended

==Description==
Okay! Once we get this up and running we should be able to send messages! In the valley at least.

It's gonna be a little bit tricky, but I've read the manual for these things cover to cover.

<Kelsey slaps the top of the listening device.>

I'm gonna put this thing back together. You watch out for the [[Horde]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Woohoo! We are up and operational!

==Completion==
Ha! I knew I could get this thing up and running in record time.

Hmm. But [[Mathias Shaw|Master Shaw]] isn't responding to my signal. That's no good.

==Notes==
;Kelsey defended
{{Dialogue|
The Horde is up to something and we're gonna find out what, one way or another.

{{gossip|I'll watch your back.}}

Two groups of two [[Warfang Lumberjack]]s and three lumberjacks attack, followed by a [[Goblin Shredder]]. When the shredder dies, the listening device deploys and activates.
