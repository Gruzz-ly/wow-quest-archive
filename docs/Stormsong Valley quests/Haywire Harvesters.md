==Objectives==
Obtain a Drenched Mainspring.
* [[Drenched Mainspring]]

==Description==
See the [[harvest golem|golems]] down there? Farmers use their sharp claws to reap the harvest, but these are cutting timber... 

Why would they need them here when they have so many laborers on hand?

I think the militia is using them to intimidate their own people!

See if you can get ahold of an intact mainspring from one. I've helped repair a few back in [[Boralus]]. I should be able to figure out who is messing with their innards.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Any luck? The mainsprings are usually brittle and easily damaged.

==Completion==
Perfect! Here, let me take a closer look.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Unnecessary Duress]] and [[Proclamation Investigation]] before heading out.

Just east of the questgivers is a rare mob, [[Foreman Scripps]].

The quest item has a terrible drop rate. Good luck!

On return:
:''Pike has gotten Addington off the hook.''
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|You were too good for this world, brother. I will make sure you receive a proper burial.}}

==Progression==
{{A House in Peril}}
