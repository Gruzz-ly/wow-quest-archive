==Objectives==
Speak with [[Rikal]] at [[Fort Daelin]].

==Description==
I'm no [[Tidesages|tidesage]], but even I can tell that whatever you have there is probably not a good sign for the bastion. 

There's one of those [[Tortollan]]s, Rikal, who's been helping us figure out a solution to whatever the [[naga]] are planning in front of the levee. He'd probably like to see this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|5|85|}}
* 4,110 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Hmm.... This is concerning. Very concerning.

==Progression==
{{From the Depths}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
