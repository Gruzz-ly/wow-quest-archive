==Objectives==
Collect 16 Abyssal Fangs.
* [[Abyssal Fang]] (16)

==Description==
If you are up to it, I have an idea to give the [[naga]] an amusing surprise.

<[[Rikal]] slowly pulls out a scroll and waves it in your face.>

I need some teeth from marine predators to cast the spell though. Luckily, the naga brought some [[Abyssal Eel|disgusting eels]] with them. Go gather their fangs, and bring them back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
I can't wait to see how this goes.

==Completion==
That's exactly what I'm looking for. Give me a bit of time to prepare the spell.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Filching from Thieves]], [[Facing the Invaders]] and [[Reclaiming our Defenses]] before heading out.

Head north and start killing everything, including the rare sea giant [[Seabreaker Skoloth]].

==Progression==
{{From the Depths}}
