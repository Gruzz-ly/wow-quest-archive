==Objectives==
Eliminate 8 [[Saurolisk]]
* [[Stonejaw Saurolisk]] slain (8)

==Description==
I don't really hate saurolisk, but there seem to be a lot more around lately. 

Stormsong's military used to thin out the population, but they didn't show up this year.

Maybe you could do the job they didn't!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 12,340 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
I still see a lot of Saurolisk around.

==Completion==
Thank you.  I can rest easy knowing they are safe.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Circle the Wagons]] before heading out.

Head southeast out of town. Keep an eye out for the rare yeti [[Grimscowl the Harebrained]] at {{co|62.0|73.9|Stormsong Valley}} on the way to [[Scalespine Hill]]. It drops the [[Yeti-Rager's Cloak]].
