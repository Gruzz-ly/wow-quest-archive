==Objectives==
Travel on [[Galeheart]] to [[Stormsong Valley]].
* Fly Galeheart to Stormsong Valley {{co|71.8|78.9|Boralus}}

==Description==
I knew it! I knew the fleet wasn't just lost!

We may be a little in over our heads here. Let's leave before things get out of hand.

Galeheart can take us to Stormsong Valley from here. No point in following tradition at this point, right?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Whatever's going on here, someone doesn't want us to know about it.

==Completion==
What's going on here?!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Thank you for your help. We won't forget it.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|I'll call Galeheart over. There's a perch on the eastern dock where she can meet us.}}

Head outside, get to the eastern edge of the island, then run all the way up to the top of the perch to find [[Galeheart]].

Hop on:
:{{text|say|Taelia|I'm afraid Kul Tiras won't be much help to the Alliance until the fleet is home again.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|We'll need to bring House Stormsong back into the fold first. They control the tidesages, and the tidesages the fleet.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Lord Stormsong rules the house, and basically the entire valley. It sounds like he's the key to all of this, but he hasn't been to Boralus in months.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|We'll start our search in [[Brennadam]]. If nothing else, hopefully we can find this [[Brother Pike]] there.}}
:''As Galeheart crosses the border between [[Tiragarde Sound]] and [[Stormsong Valley]] via the [[Highland Pass]], Taelia notices a large group of people on the ground...''
:{{text|say|Taelia|What's going on down there? Galeheart, take us in!}}
