==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Captain Calico McGee.jpg|Captain Calico McGee|Owns a beautiful cat named [[Maurice]].}}
Eliminate Calico McGee.
* [[Captain Calico McGee]] slain {{co|36.7|56.8|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
I did sometime in [[Tol Dagor]] with the Captain of this crew, Calico McGee. He likes to hang back and direct his men from afar.

I just happened to have spotted him across the flats. You and I should go pay him a visit!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
We should take care of Calico McGee.

==Completion==
I never liked his cat.

==Notes==
Pick up [[I Want It All Now]] and [[The Proof of Piracy]] before heading out.

Just west of McGee is a wagon full of [[Irontide Loot]]. Interact with the chest to start [[All Laid Out For Us]]. Try to pick that quest up as quickly as possible.
