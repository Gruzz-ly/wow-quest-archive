==Objectives==
Collect a Water Bucket, Sack of Flour, and Logs then return them to [[Marie Davenport]].
* [[Water Bucket (Stormsong Valley)|Water Bucket]] {{co|30.7|67.6|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Sack of Flour]] {{co|29.3|69.7|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Logs]] {{co|29.8|67.0|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
As you can plainly see by the rocks falling from the sky, we are under siege by those terrible [[ettin]]s!

If you could be obliged to lend us a hand, I'd be most grateful. We can't possibly hope to defeat them unless we properly prepare you first.

Could you be a dear and fetch a few things for me from around the [[Millstone Hamlet|Hamlet]]? Some water, a sack of flour and a bundle of logs should help.

I've already sent my grandson, Charles, off to fetch a few other items. I've not seen him for quite a while though.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Did you have any trouble dear?

==Completion==
Thank you so much. I wish Charles was half as studious as you.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Marie Davenport|Oh... and if you see my grandson, Charles, please make sure he's not cowering under a tree somewhere.}}

Charles is outside just to the northwest, cowering under a tree next to the pile of Logs. He also starts [[Gunpowder Plot]], [[Aww, Rats!]] and [[Basement Dwellers]].

By the well in the center of town is the Water Bucket. Also, the Bulletin Board in town starts [[WANTED: Razorclaw Alpha (Alliance)]].

East on the other side of the windmill is the Sack of Flower. In the basement is the rare spider [[Broodmother]].

Also in town to the east, [[Shepherd Milbrooke]] offers [[Cry Wolf]] and [[The Black Sheep]].
