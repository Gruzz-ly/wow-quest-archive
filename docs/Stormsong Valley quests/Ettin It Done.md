==Objectives==
Use Flour Bombs to slay 8 Ettins.
* [[Ettin]] slain (8)
*[[Flour Bomb]] (provided)

==Description==
Okay, now here's a little something I whipped up for you with those extra ingredients.

We don't have much around here in the way of weapons, but we've got gunpowder and plenty of flour. A surprisingly explosive combination!

Toss one of these goodies at those nasty ettins, should disorient them long enough to give 'em a good whack upside the head!

You thought I was just a sweet old lady, baking delicious cookies for any ol' passerby? Hah, I'll have you know I was quite the firecracker in my day.

* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
How'd my giant treats work out?

==Completion==
<Name>, my grandson could learn a thing or two from you. Come back to visit anytime!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Cookie Delivery]] before heading out.

Use the quest item to knock off about 30% of the ettin's health and disorient it for 10 seconds. Use that time to lay on some damage.

Charles is in the ettin quest area as well.
