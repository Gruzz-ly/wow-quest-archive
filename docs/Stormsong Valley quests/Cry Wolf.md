==Objectives==
Kill 10 Feral Razorclaws.
* [[Feral Razorclaw]] slain (10)

==Description==
Lately, the wolves have been terrorizing my flock. They weren't an issue until the giants moved in and pushed them out of their normal hunting grounds.

I feel bad asking you to do this, but could you thin their ranks a bit? If there are fewer wolves competing for food, maybe they'll leave us alone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
I wish there was a better way.

==Completion==
My flock should be able to rest easier now.
