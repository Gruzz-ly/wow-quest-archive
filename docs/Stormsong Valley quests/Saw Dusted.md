==Objectives==
Kill 10 Warfang Lumberjacks.
* [[Warfang Lumberjack]] slain (10)

==Description==
If we want to keep them from expanding into [[Stormsong Valley|Stormsong]], we need to cripple their lumber production!

They've only got so many lumberjacks running around. If we can cut some of them down, they'll be forced to reconsider their plans.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
How many d'ya get?

==Completion==
Good work. That'll definitely put a damper on things.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Burn It All Down]] and [[Get Shredded]]  before heading out.

The flamethrower does work on [[Warfang Lumberjack]]s.

==Progression==
{{Cycle of Hatred}}

==Patch changes==
