==Objectives==
Burn 6 Lumber Piles and 2 Siege Towers.
* [[Lumber Pile (Stormsong Valley)|Lumber Pile]] burned (6)
* [[Siege Tower (Stormsong Valley)|Siege Tower]] burned (2)
* [[Patched Mine Sweeper]] (provided)

==Description==
Alright, the flamethrower is all patched up. Now we're going to get a little payback for [[Brennadam]]!

If it's flammable, it's a target. If not, well, it probably still needs to die anyway. And let's bring down those siege towers while we're at it.

Burn it all to the ground!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Well at least the flamethrower hasn't blown up on ya yet.

==Completion==
Nothing quite like the smell of freshly roasted Orc!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Get Shredded]] and [[Saw Dusted]] before heading out.
