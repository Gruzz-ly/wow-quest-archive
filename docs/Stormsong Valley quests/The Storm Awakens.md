==Objectives==
Rally 12 Defectors.
* Defectors rallied (12)

==Description==
I must watch over [[Samuel Williams|Samuel]] for now. I fear for the darkness assaulting his mind.

The fallen men and women around us were defectors from the house. There will be more like them within [[Sagehold]]. 

Find them, and tell them 'the storm awakens'. Knowledge of our cause has spread; we need to bring all we can to our side.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Find all you can who will stand with us. We are stronger united.

==Completion==
I saw some of the defectors leaving. I'm glad we got to them before [[Lord Stormsong]] did.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Twisted Intentions]] before heading out. In the quest area, the bonus objective [[A Clean Slate]] is also available.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Taelia, <name>, this burden must be yours to bear. I will take Samuel and meet you by the Shrine as soon as we are able.}}

While in Sagehold proper, find [[Tideguard Victoria]] left for dead just outside a house. She offers [[Oathbound]].

Interact with any [[Locked Door]]s or defectors and nearby friendlies will also count towards the objective:
*{{text|say|[[Awakened Tideguard]]|If the Storm's Wake calls, I must answer.}}
*{{text|say|Awakened Tideguard|Live or die, our time has come.}}
*{{text|say|Awakened Tideguard|You have my blade.}}
*{{text|say|[[Tidesage Defector]]|I knew this day would come. I shall join the others.}}
*{{text|say|Tidesage Defector|We swill stop these fiends together!}}
*{{text|say|Tidesage Defector|There are others. We are not all lost!}}

==Progression==
{{At the Edge of Madness}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
