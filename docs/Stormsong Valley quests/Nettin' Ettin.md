==Objectives==
Speak with [[Wyna Breezehorn]].

==Description==
An [[ettin]] has been captured by our troops at [[Stonetusk Watch]].

Apparently, the creature is being trained to work for the [[Horde]] as a beast of burden.

Make your way to Stonetusk Watch in [[Stormsong Valley]] and meet with Wyna Breezehorn. She has been training the ettin to do her bidding.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ettins aren't as hard to train as you might think. Go ahead and take [[Donk]] for a ride. It's okay, he's friendly enough!

==Progression==
