==Objectives==
Get Mud Worm Meat for [[Maokka]].
* [[Mud Worm Meat]] (8)
* [[Remote Earl-E Designator]] (provided)

==Description==
It could take you days to get that much meat, and I don't want to wait around. So, we'll use a Bot as bait! 

You send [[Earl-E|EARL-E]] towards any disturbances you see in the mud. He'll make enough noise to scare any worms out. 

Then kill the worms, get the meat. I'll watch from here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* [[Maokka's Box]]
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Do you have the meat yet?

==Completion==
This will make a nice Mud Worm Soup. I wasn't liking this box anyway.

==Notes==
Before heading out into the [[Briny Flats]], pick up [[A Horrible Place]] from [[Grettle Haribull]].

On the flats, look for [[Pinku'shon]], a rare hermit crab, at {{co|38.1|50.8|Stormsong Valley}} in the northwest end of the quest area.

Use the quest item to target dust clouds on the ground, which will spawn a [[Mud Feeder]]. Kill it for a single piece of Mud Worm Meat at a time.

Maokka offers a breadcrumb to the [[Jeweled Coast]] in [[A Turtle's Invitation]], and Moxie continues quests here at [[Deadwash]] with [[No Bot Left Behind]]

==Progression==
{{More Treasure in Deadwash}}
