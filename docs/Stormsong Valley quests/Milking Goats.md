==Objectives==
Collect 6 Mountain Goat Milk.
* [[Mountain Goat Milk]] (6)
* [[Milk Pail]] (provided)

==Description==
Unfortunately, [[Shepherd Milbrooke|Milbrooke's]] [[Milbrooke's Flock|flock]] hasn't been producing lately. What with all the wolves about, the poor things must be terrified.

Wild goats wander the hills, and they are quite fearless compared to the sheep. 

If you can find a few with young ones about, you may be able to persuade them to offer some fresh, delicious goat milk!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Were you able to collect enough milk?

==Completion==
It smells wonderful. This is perfect, thank you <name>!

==Notes==
Click on [[Mother Goat]]s (possible mounted) or use the quest item on them. Mountain Goats will get the Wrong Goat debuff, knocking you off.
