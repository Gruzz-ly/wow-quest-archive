==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Voidborne Ascendant.jpg|Voidborne Ascendant|Progenitor. Destroyer. Unmaker.}}
Defeat the Ascendant Nightmare.
* [[Voidborne Ascendant]] slain

==Description==
We stand on the brink, you and I. The final act looms over us, casting a terrible shadow.

Deep we plumbed, seeking knowledge of the world. Deeper still we delved, until our fate was inevitable. Minds were shattered, my comrades ran screaming into the night. We are all lost, to that terrible Thing...

Now, the malformed syzygy beckons. Complete the ritual and bring about the end.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* [[Glowing Azerite]] (300 [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 22,310 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The end is inescapable...

==Completion==
Victory... foolish and meaningless.

==Notes==
As before, go back up to the [[Precipice of Oblivion]] and this time, interact with the [[Eye of Revelation]] statue. The Voidborne Ascendant will spawn behind it.
