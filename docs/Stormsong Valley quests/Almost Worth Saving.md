==Objectives==
Rescue 6 Frightened [[Peon]]s from [[Warfang Hold]].
*[[Frightened Peon (Stormsong Valley)|Frightened Peon]] rescued (6)

==Description==
We tried to evacuate as many of our people from the hold as we could, but some of the peons weren't so lucky. 

They're worthless as fighters, but we'll need their labor in the times ahead.

Please, save them if you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are they still alive?

==Completion==
Good work, <name>. We'll have need of their labor when we rebuild.

You can also interact with [[Barricade (Stormsong Valley)|Barricades]] to free the peons.
