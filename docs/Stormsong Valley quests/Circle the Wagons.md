Maybe they had trouble on the road, that old wagon is always breaking down. I need to be sure they are safe!

Can you check on them for me?

==Progress==
I'm getting worried, they should have been here hours ago.

==Completion==
Thank you.  I can rest easy knowing they are safe.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sometimes Less Is More]] before heading out.

Head southeast out of town. Keep an eye out for the rare yeti [[Grimscowl the Harebrained]] at {{co|62.0|73.9|Stormsong Valley}} on the way to [[Scalespine Hill]]. It drops the [[Yeti-Rager's Cloak]].

{{Dialogue|title=Lorraine|
The wagon flipped over. It was terrifying!

I was headed back to town to get help, but got scared.

{{gossip|You are safe now.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Lorraine Hood|Thank you! I think I can make it back on my own now.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Darion|
A Saurolisk spooked the horses, the wagon spilled, and we lost our supplies.

My two girls Lorraine and Mallory are still out there, they could use your help.

{{gossip|I'll see they are safe.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Darion Hood|I'll stay here and get the horses settled.}}

{{Dialogue|title=Mallory|
The wagon is wrecked, and we could have been killed.

The beast that attacked us is in that cave.  I am not leaving till it's dead!

{{gossip|I will take care of it.}}
}}

Mallory immediately offers [[A Saur Point]]. Pick it up.
