==Objectives==
* [[Lost Sea Scroll]]

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
*[[Tide-Speaker's Tome]]

==Progress==
Yes? What do you have there?

==Completion==
Oh my, that scroll is old, even amongst the relics of the sea.

Those that would commune with the waves have existed since long before our written history. Relics of the most ancient tide-speakers have all but disappeared from our world, lost to the deeps that spoke to them.

I will put it in a safe place, thank you for bringing this to me.
