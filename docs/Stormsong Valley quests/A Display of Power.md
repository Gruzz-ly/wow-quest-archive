==Objectives==
Speak to Nathanos Blightcaller to witness the meeting of leaders in [[Warfang Hold]].
* Speak to [[Nathanos Blightcaller]]

==Description==
It looks like all the big players are here. This thing's gonna be starting any moment now.

You'll probably want to get a good seat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Core]] (750x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* {{cost|2|34|}}

==Completion==
This is a troublesome turn of events.

I'm afraid the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee Queen]] may have set in motion a ruinous path for the [[Horde]]. 

Keep your eyes and ears open, <name>. The day is not yet done.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Nathanos
:Good work securing the area, <class>.

Subsequently, each of the present individuals has something to say.

===Individual dialogue===
;[[Lor'themar Theron]]
:I cannot fault Baine's heart, even if his actions were drastic. Through this act of defiance, he exposed a schism in the Horde that has been growing since the attack on [[Teldrassil]]. I fear that by openly opposing Sylvanas, he may have put his own people at risk. As mine would be, were I to side with him. These are perilous times. We must be cautious... and deliberate.

;[[Garona Halforcen]]
:You see what happened to Baine? To Zelling? That's why we need to lay low, keep our heads down, follow the warchief's lead. At least for now. Baine's mistake wasn't acting against Sylvanas. His mistake was acting too soon.

;[[Trade Prince Gallywix]]
:Well, I didn't see that comin'! Wish I'd known things were gonna heat up this much. I coulda charged DOUBLE for admission!

;[[Eitrigg]]
:[[Of Blood and Honor|Years ago]], [[Tirion Fordring]] sacrificed everything to spare my life as a matter of honor. Baine has done much the same. Are we now to punish him for it? I fear the Horde is becoming [[Old Horde|what we once hated]], <class>. And I do not like it.

;[[Lilian Voss]]
:[[Thomas Zelling]] has... had... a family in life. He made me promise to keep them safe, even after they called him a monster and shunned him for being undead. It is a promise I will continue to keep. If they ever ask how he met his fate, I will tell them that he died a hero. We [[Forsaken]] are raised with free will. That's what separates us from the [[Scourge]]. Sylvanas Windrunner used to take pride in that distinction. But after all I have seen in this war, I must wonder if that still holds true.

;[[Rexxar]]
:There are others who must hear of this <name>. And they will.

;[[Mayla Highmountain]]
:Is this what the Horde stands for? Imprisoning those who act with compassion and honor? Perhaps my people should have never left [[Highmountain]]...

;[[Ji Firepaw]]
:I can sense much anger and frustration among those gathered here today. In my [[Pandaria|homeland]], we saw such feelings manifest into [[Sha|very real threats]] after we spent too much time and energy suppressing them. Baine had to act, lest his anger turn into a greater threat to the Horde. We should all take a lesson from this.

;[[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]
:Our rebellion against [[Elisande]] was just, and it earned me a blade in the back. I pray Baine does not meet a similar fate. The nightborne are still new to the Horde. Perhaps I should seek Lor'themar's council. He understands what my people have endured, and I have learned much through our conversations.

;[[Princess Talanji]]
:Without de Horde beside us, [[Zandalari Empire|my people]] would now be at de mercy of de [[Alliance]]. We owe much to de warchief... but we will not follow her blindly. Baine Bloodhoof has shown honor and respect to de Zandalari. He must be given a chance to face his accusers and answer for dis supposed crime.

;[[Overlord Geya'rah]]
:She is no orc, but the warchief shows strength by punishing that tauren who deceived and betrayed her. Those who lack loyalty also lack honor.

;[[Rokhan]]
:Dis be some bad juju, mon. Da Horde gotta stick together if we gonna win dis war... but Sylvanas... She not be makin' dat easy. And dis just gonna throw more fuel on da fire.
