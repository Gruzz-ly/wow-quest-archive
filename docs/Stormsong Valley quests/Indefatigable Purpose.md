==Objectives==
Cleanse 3 Drowned Altars.

* [[Drowned Altar]]s cleansed (3)
* [[Holy Water (BfA)]] (provided)

==Description==
Its grip weakens, if only briefly. We must claim this place anew!

Flopping, nightmarish horrors have infested the caves amongst the cove. Take the sacred blessings. Venture forth into the dark and find their altars. 

Purge their [[Blasphemy|blasphemous]] constructions from our lands!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Where there is no peril, there can be no glory!

==Completion==
A victory... perhaps a turning point.

== Notes ==
The altars are rough platforms of rocks with a stone sphere, identical to [[The Pearl of the Depths]], located at:

* [[Dank Grotto]]{{coords|80.50|57.04|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Moldering Foyer]]{{coords|81.64|50.29|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Crumbling Chambers]]{{coords|86.58|51.98|Stormsong Valley}}

These caves also happen to be the ones close to sea level, if you have a hard time locating them. Note that the one in the Crumbling Chambers can't be seen from outside.

;Clear a cave with no altar
