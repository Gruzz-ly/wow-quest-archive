==Objectives==
Find 12 Old Ship Parts.
* [[Old Ship Parts]] (12)

==Description==
I got a little deal on the side, selling used ship parts to [[Addington Shipyards]].

While you're out looking for the treasure, see what sort of useful parts you can salvage from the mud: anchors, cannons, whatever!

We'll sell them to Addington and cut you in for a share of the profits.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mud-Slicked Capote
|Salvage-Hunter's Torch
|Anchor-Strapped Barrier
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
See what you can find out in the mud.

==Completion==
We'll make good money off these. No one will know they are used parts.

==Notes==
Pick up all of [[Not On Our Payroll]], [[Fun With Magnets]] and [[Bomb Beats Rock]] before heading out.

While out and about, look for [[Crushtacean]] at {{co|51.2|55.4|Stormsong Valley}} in a cave off on the eastern side of the quest area. It drops the [[Bonesplinter Band]] and some [[Azerite (resource)]].

Ship parts and restless stones carpet the area.
