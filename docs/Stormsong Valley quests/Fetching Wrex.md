==Objectives==
Crack open [[Crystallized Honey (quest item)|Crystallized Honey]] to search for Wrex.
* [[Wrex]] rescued

==Description==
When all the commotion started, [[Ancel Mildenhall|Ancel's]] pup ran off. The poor thing was terrified!

A couple farmhands went to look for him, but with all of these monsters terrorizing the farm, I fear the worst!

Can you keep an eye out for Wrex while you're up in the hills? He might have gotten trapped in the honey too.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Wrex is a very good boy.

==Completion==
Ancel will be happy to know that Wrex is safe and sound!

==Notes==
Pick up all of [[Free the Farmhands]], [[The Bee Team]] and [[Wendigo Away]] before heading out.

Crystallized Honey is found only in the small caves surrounding the quest area. Shatter eight chunks of Crystallized Honey to find Wrex. It doesn't matter which eight.

Eight:
