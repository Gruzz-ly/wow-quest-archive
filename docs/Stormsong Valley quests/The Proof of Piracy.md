==Objectives==
Destroy 6 pirate Rum Stashes.
* [[Irontide Rum Stash]] destroyed (6)

==Description==
One thing [[pirate]]s love more than [[gold]] is rum. So we're going to find their rum stashes and blow them up. With the rum all gone, a lot of the pirates should move on.

Use my special barrel busting [[bomb]]s to destroy the pirates' hidden rum stashes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Let's blow up some rum!

==Completion==
That was hard, but it had to be done.

==Notes==
Pick up [[I Want It All Now]] and [[We're Not Friends]] before heading out.

While on this quest, players have access to an extra ability:
*{{Abilities|Barrel Buster Bomb|range=5-30|cd=8 sec|Inflicts fire damage and stuns enemies as well as destroying rum barrels.|notes=Instant|id=274754|icon=inv_misc_bomb_09}}

Just west of [[Captain Calico McGee]] is a wagon full of [[Irontide Loot]]. Interact with the chest to start [[All Laid Out For Us]]. Try to pick that quest up as quickly as possible.

Use the extra action button and target the barrels of rum on the ground. Each set of three counts as one stash.

==Progression==
{{More Treasure in Deadwash}}
