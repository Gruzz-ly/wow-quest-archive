==Objectives==
Take [[Liam (child)|Liam]] to see Shrine of the Storms from the beach near [[Mariner's Strand]] in [[Stormsong Valley]]. Make sure to call for him if he is not present when you get there.
* Visit [[Shrine of the Storm]]
* [[Kul Tiran Orphan Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
Sometimes [[tidesages]] come to the orphanage and tell us about the sea and how they can talk to it.

I wanna talk to water!

We've gone on field trips to [[Stormsong Monastery|their monastery]] here in [[Boralus]], but I heard their home in Stormsong is much more impressive. Can you take me to go see it? I heard there's a great view from the [[Brineworks]]!

==Progress==
The tidesages always say that the water talks to them. How does it talk without a mouth?

==Completion==
That tidesage was so mysterious! Do you know him?

I wanna be mysterious like him! He could make water tornadoes! He even said the water talked to him! How cool is that?!

... I'm all wet now.

==Notes==
Arriving at the location:
:{{text|say|Liam|Wow...}}
:''[[Brother Pike]] spawns, walking up to Liam.''
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|It is truly a marvel to behold, is it not?}}
:{{text|say|Liam|Whoa! Mister, are you a real tidesage?!}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|I am indeed, my young friend. What brings you into the shadow of the Shrine of the Storm?}}
:{{text|say|Liam|I'm trying to decide what I want to be when I grow up. I wanted to see the giant squid rock!}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Shall we take a closer look?}}
:''Brother Pike casts a spell on you, Liam and himself, summoning water tornadoes called Water Flights, and start flying to get a closer look at the giant squid rock.''
:{{text|say|Liam|Look <name>, we're flying in water! This is so cool!}}
:{{text|say|Liam|Master tidesage, do you really live here?}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|I did, once. But now it is in the hands of those who wish to do harm.}}
:{{text|say|Liam|You mean bad guys? Why did bad guys take your home?}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|They didn't take it, my child. They are my brothers and sisters. But darkness lurks in their hearts.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|There may come a time when you face evil. Perhaps with less fanfare than <name>, but you will face it all the same.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|I pray that you stay true to your chosen path. If you do, you shall find great happiness and fulfillment in life.}}
:{{text|say|Liam|Did... did the water tell you that?}}
: ''You all land back on the beach, and Brother Pike starts walking off to the distance.''
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|That it did, Liam. May the tides bless you.}}
