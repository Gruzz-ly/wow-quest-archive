==Objectives==
Use the [[Prototype Shredder MK-03|Prototype Shredder]] to burn 8 Warfang Buildings and kill General Blackstone and 8 Horde Soldiers.
* Pilot Prototype Shredder
* Warfang Buildings burned (8)
* [[General Blackstone]] slain {{co|49.1|34.5|Stormsong Valley}}
* Horde Soldiers slain (30)

==Description==
This is it <name>, now is the time to strike. 

Take this shredder and destroy their stronghold. Burn everything to the ground!

Show no mercy. They certainly didn't offer any to all of the innocent civilians they slaughtered in Brennadam!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Make them pay for what they've done to us.

==Completion==
I can't believe you actually pulled that off. We may actually stand a fighting chance now!

==Notes==
Hop in. The shredder has four abilities:
#{{abilities|Forked Lightning|range=20|Inflicts 9,503 Nature damage to up to 5 enemy targets within 10 yards of each other.|notes=1 sec cast|id=274027|image=}}
#{{abilities|Flamethrower|range=15|cd=10 sec|Releases a stream of fire at nearby enemies for 5 sec, inflicting 11,404 damage every 1 sec and slowing movement speed by 70% for 5 sec.|notes=Channeled|id=274038|image=}}
#{{abilities|Crash Override|range=10-40|cd=15 sec|Jump to the targeted destination, crashing down on enemy targets for 47,514 Fire damage|notes=1.5 sec cast}}
#{{abilities|Overcharge|cd=60 sec|Overcharge circuits to repeair shredder for 5% health per 2 sec for 16 sec, and blasts nearby enemies for 12,925 Nature damage every 1 sec.|notes=1.5 sec cast}}

Head north into the [[Warfang Hold]]. It's possible to skip around the fence on the ridge to get to [[General Blackstone]] from the south, rather than from the camp proper.

Use the flamethrower on cooldown and spam Forked Lightning otherwise. Blackstone is immune to the fear from the flamethrower, as are the summoned army of the dead he channels. Still, he'll go down quickly.

Make sure to burn down the tower!

Then act like it's an over-easy ''Warcraft III'' mission and burn every unit ([[Hardened Grunt]]s, [[Wizened Necrolyte]]s, [[Deathguard Shocktrooper]]s, [[Seasoned Hunter]]s, [[Veteran Berserker]]s, [[Wizened Shaman]], and [[Sin'dorei Battlemage]]) and destroy every building in camp.

This concludes the "Cycle of Hatred" chapter of the [[Stormsong Valley storyline]]. There's no quest assistance out of the area, so just make a run for it.
