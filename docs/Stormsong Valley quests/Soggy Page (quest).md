==Progress==
Yes? What is it?

==Completion==
Ah, another waterlogged page, excellent. I will add it to the pile to dry.

These scrolls seem to tell the tale of an ancient wanderer, who travelled a lush jungle full of danger.

I would very much like to see some of the creatures depicted therein. Someday, perhaps.

I have also been finding many duplicate pages. I ask myself, how can this be? And yet, here, again, we find page nine.

Will you let me know if someone needs page nine?
