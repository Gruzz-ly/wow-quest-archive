==Objectives==
Search the [[Mildenhall Meadery]] for clues.
* Clues found (5)

==Description==
Hmm... okay, okay, let's think.

If you were my dad and you accidentally set loose a bunch of honey monsters all over the place, what would you do?

Well, okay, you would probably beat all of them up. But he probably ran away.

If he left in a hurry, maybe he left something for us to find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything else?

==Completion==
Hmm... we checked everywhere.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Cleanup Duty]] before heading out. Then get killing.
