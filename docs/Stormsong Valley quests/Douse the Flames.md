==Objectives==
Obtain a [[Fading Umbral Wand]] and use it to put out 4 flames around [[Warfang Hold]].
* Flames doused (4)

==Description==
Do you smell it, <name>? Smoke! They're burning down Warfang Hold!

There is little point to our battle if our base burns to the ground!

Their [[tidesages]] use wands to control their constructs of water. In our hands they may give us a chance to save the Hold! 

Get those wands and put out the fires before the camp burns to ash!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We're fortunate that the Kul Tirans have a greater affinity for water than they do for fire.

==Completion==
Fire, blood, war. Nothing will stop us.
