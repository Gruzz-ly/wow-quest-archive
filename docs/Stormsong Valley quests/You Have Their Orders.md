==Objectives==
Find the Warchief's Orders.
* [[Warchief's Orders]] {{co|54.3|61.1|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
The [[Horde]] is an army, make no mistake. And armies need orders.

Someone must be giving orders here. They know the plan, and I want to know the plan too.

Look for the people who seem to be in charge and see if you can uncover any intelligence so we know what to do next.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
You find those orders?

==Completion==
The [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee Queen]] is not like the previous [[Warchief]]s.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Bombs, Away]] and [[Dousing the Flames]] before heading out. While in the area the Bonus objective [[The Battle for Brennadam]] is also available.

[[Champion Lockjaw]] is found on the northwest side of the quest area.
