==Objectives==
Enter the Time Rift. 
*Enter the [[Anomalous Time Rift|Time Rift]]

==Description==
I saw her in there, destroying another part of my timeline.

With every thread she severs, I lose myself more and more...

Perhaps I will perish, but I won't let her ruin the fabric of [[time]].

I need you to join me one last time. 

I can only end this with your support.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We can't fail. Not with what's at stake.

==Completion==
This is the end, tailor. I will suffer this no longer.

==Notes==
Walk into the time rift to be sent to the [[Bronze Dragonshrine]] in [[Dragonblight]].

==Progression==
{{A Friend in Needle}}

==Patch changes==
