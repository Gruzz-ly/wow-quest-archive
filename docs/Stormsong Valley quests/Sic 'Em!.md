==Objectives==
Defeat Foreman Razorgnarl.
* [[Foreman Razorgnarl]] slain{{Co|51.5|68|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
[[Humphrey]]'s a good tracker, to be sure. He's also the orneriest, angriest, most dogged dog if he sets his eyes on a [[quilboar]]. This will certainly be useful.

Below our very noses, the foreman organizes and directs the tunnelers to cause the most mayhem and destruction. If you can put an end to him, it should make things a lot easier for us to move around the farmlands.

Humphrey looks a bit hungry, wouldn't you say? Why don't you bring him with you to take care of business?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
+75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]
* [[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
If I could rate Humphrey, I'd give him at least a twelve out of ten.

==Completion==
Jolly good. With him out of the way, the quilboar around here should be less organized and take longer to mobilize.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Follow Your Nose]] before heading out.

Before getting started, head just southwest to find the mouth of a cave at {{co|51.0|68.8|Stormsong Valley}} leading underneath the stables. Down at the bottom at {{co|49.7|68.1|Stormsong Valley}} is the rare quilboar [[Vinespeaker Ratha]].

Back on the surface, head north to the marked quest area at {{co|53.3|66.6|Stormsong Valley}} to find the mouth of the [[Briarback Warrens]]. Head down the bottom of the cave and take Razorgnarl out.

Finally, off to the southeast at {{co|53.7|72.2|Stormsong Valley}} is another cave mouth. The cave system was dug out by the Briarback, but it has been taken over by lichen. Five [[Stormcap Warrior]]s are guarding a [[Lichen-Covered Chest]] at {{co|53.1|69.1|Stormsong Valley}} in the bottom of the cave. The chest contains a piece of Azerite armor!
