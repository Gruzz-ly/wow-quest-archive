;Moxie
:We got problems <name>. The Tortollan found a box, and we want it!
:{{Gossip|Tortollan?}}
:The shell with arms and legs right over there!
:Don't let him fool you. He's smart and very nosey. Always poking around collecting old relics, scrolls and junk.
:We don't want him finding the treasure first.
:{{gossip|O.K.}}
:{{gossip|What's the plan?}}
:I was thinking electric shocks, or fire, maybe we just blow him up!
:But, it's bad luck to kill a Tortollan and I don't need any more bad luck.
:So, you show me how you would handle this Tortollan?
:{{gossip|I will speak to Maokka.}}

;Maokka
:I was standing here for a long time. Then I found this interesting box in the mud.
:{{gossip|That box?}}
:The box is mine, ya nosey <race>.
:I need Mud Worms to make my Mud Worm soup, but the worms is hiding! I'm patient, I can wait here a few more days, maybe find more boxes?
:You find me some Mud Worm Keat and I'll trade you this box.
:*{{gossip|I'll get the meat.}}
:*{{gossip|Turtle Soup?}}
::Turtle soup is not half as tasty as <race> soup.
::Just get the Mud Worm meat and leave the small turtles alone.
::Come visit me someday and we can explore other soup options!
::{{gossip|O.K.}}
