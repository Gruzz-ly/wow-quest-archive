==Objectives==
Collect 8 Sacks of Grain.
* [[Sack of Grain (Stormsong Valley)]] (8)

==Description==
We've got to salvage what we can.

This valley is the breadbasket of [[Kul Tiras]]. We feed the citizens, the militia, the army, you name it! Perhaps you've heard of our famous Kul Tiran sourdough bread? Goes great with sausages.

More importantly, those blasted [[Horde]] are getting in the way of our harvest! Lucky for us, the golems work 'round the clock to package the grain.

I just need you to go out to the fields and grab as many bags as you can carry. I'll pay you for your trouble, of course.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 50x [[War Resources]]
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
We need that grain!

==Completion==
Good harvest this year. Our people will eat well.

==Notes==
While passing through the [[Amber Waves]] on the way to [[Briarback Kraul]] and farmers [[Farmer Burton|Burton]] and [[Farmer Goldfield|Goldfield]], keep an eye out for [[Farmer Max]] at {{co|55.0|68.0|Stormsong Valley}}. He offers these quests.

Pick up [[Raiders of the Lost Crop]]  before heading out.
