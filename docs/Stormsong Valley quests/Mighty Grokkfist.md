==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|image=Grokkfist.jpg|name=Grokkfist|text=Kill, smash, crunch and munch.}}
Use the Pack of Rats to kill Grokkfist.
* [[Grokkfist]] slain
*Meet [[Charles Davenport]] back in [[Millstone Hamlet]].
* [[Pack of Rats]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Marie Davenport|Grandma]] is always telling me I need to toughen up a little... how easy we've got it these days.

I read a story about giants that are terrified of rats, so I thought, "Hey Charles, here's a great idea, let's take all those rats <name> gathered and let 'em loose on the ettins."

I tried to be tough for once, but look how it turned out. Now, I'm stuck out here, just hoping I don't get squashed.

Their leader is just up the hill there. Here, take the rats with you and let's hope I was right!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Did it work!?

==Completion==
I can't believe it actually worked. I thought for sure we'd all be squished!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Wheat A Minute]] before heading out.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Charles Davenport|I'm getting out of here as soon as it's clear. I'll see you back at Grandma's house, good luck!}}
