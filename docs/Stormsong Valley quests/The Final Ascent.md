==Objectives==
Open the [[Tempest Gate]].
* Tempest Gate opened
*Join your forces at the Shrine of the Storm.
*[[Dead Ringer (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Beyond this gate lies [[Lord Stormsong]]... and our retribution. It seems he has sealed it tight, likely to buy himself time to finish whatever foul ritual awaits us.

Release the souls within the Dead Ringer when you are ready. I will direct them into the binding holding the gate shut.

From there, we find Stormsong and end this once and for all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
No matter what lies beyond that gate, we face it together.

==Completion==
I thought this moment would never come.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Will the rest of the Storm's Wake even get here in time?}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Patience, Taelia. They will come.}}

Use the quest item:
:{{text|yell|Brother Pike|Come, brothers and sisters. We stand together!}}
:{{text|say|Samuel Williams|[Shath'Yar] TIDES OF BLOOD! RISE! RISE!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Hang in there, Sam! We're almost there!}}
:''[[Awakened Conscript]]s join you.''
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Keep moving. The darkness claws at his mind!}}

Mount up and follow the party up the hill to reach the [[Shrine of the Storm]].

==Progression==
{{At the Edge of Madness}}
