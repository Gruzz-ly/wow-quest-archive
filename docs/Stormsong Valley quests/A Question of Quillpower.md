==Objectives==
Ride the [[Ornery Battleboar]] out of [[Briarback Kraul]] and report to [[Mayor Roz]].
* Escape the Kraul

==Description==
I can't believe you managed to kill that thing. You're quite impressive, you know that?

Either way, we should be getting back to Roz with our report. We're stuck in the middle of the kraul, surrounded by angry [[quilboar]]. But I have a plan!

Some of the boars seem reasonable enough. I gave them a bit of my rations and they've been following me around. I bet we can use them to hitch a ride out of this place. You in?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
Calvin has briefed me, but I am eager to hear your report.

==Notes==
Hop on the [[Ornery Battleboar]] next to Calvin:
:{{text|say|Sergeant Calvin|Let's get out of here!}}
:{{text|say|Sergeant Calvin|Keep to the right! I think I saw a way out!}}
:{{text|say|Sergeant Calvin|Comin' through!}}
:{{text|say|Sergeant Calvin|We're out! I'll make my way back to Roz with the report. You've saved the town, hero!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Major Roz|I'll spare you the flowery words, friend. I was never good at them anyway.}}
:{{text|say|Mayor Roz|Throwing back the quilboar, across the farms and into the kraul itself. Rescuing the citizens and farmers... you've done more for us than the militia ever could... or would.}}
:{{text|say|Mayor Roz|No offense, Calvin.}}
:{{text|say|Mayor Roz|I don't like speeches much, so I'll keep it short. Thank you. You will always have allies in Stormsong Valley.}}

This concludes the "Briarback Kraul" chapter of the [[Stormsong Valley storyline]].
