==Objectives==
Free 5 villagers.
* [[Frightened Villager|Villagers]] freed (5)

==Description==
When the [[naga]] force first arrived, there were a handful of the local fishermen out on boats. One of our [[scout]]s reports that most of them have been captured and are currently being kept in cages around the beach.

Free any of them you happen to find and point them back here. We'll get them armed and remind the naga that you don't mess with sailors!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Have you found any of our civilians?

==Completion==
With these numbers, we should be able to hold our own here. Oars and fishing nets make surprisingly effective weapons.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Freedom for the Sea]] and [[A Bit of a Bind]] and [[Caught in the Net]] before heading out.

Kill a path southward, simply killing [[Bound Seasurge]]s, looting naga for [[Fishbone Key]]s to open [[Naga Cage]]s and free villagers, and finding [[Binder Sa'thress]] at the south end of the beach before it turns west.

==Progression==
