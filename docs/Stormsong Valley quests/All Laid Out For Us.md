==Notes==
While on the [[Briny Flats]] for [[I Want It All Now]], [[We're Not Friends]] and [[The Proof of Piracy]], find the cart full of [[Irontide Loot]] just west of [[Captain Calico McGee]]. It starts this quest.

None of the NPCs have any special gossip text, but they are all on the flats.

;Chopper Darry
:If it's involves gold, count me in!

:{{Gossip|I need your help.}}
:{{Text|say|Chopper Darry|When we get the gold, I gonna buy me some smellin' perfume and take a bath in it.}}

;Toothless Eddard
:What's up <name>?

:{{Gossip|I need your help.}}
:{{Text|say|Toothless Eddard|Make me rich, <name>. I wanna buy me some gold teeth!}}

;Big Find Balor
:What's up <name>?

Once all three have been recruited, return to the treasure and interact with it again and the helpers will pick it up.
