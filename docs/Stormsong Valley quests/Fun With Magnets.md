==Objectives==
Collect 60 Lost Coins.
* [[Lost Coin]] (60)
*[[Magnetized Metal Collector]] (provided)

==Description==
My last time in [[Tol Barad]] I had to leave in a big hurry, but I grabbed a few gadgets on the way out. 

This device is one of my favorites, so don't break it! It'll suck the treasure right out of the mud. It may make you tingle some, that's just the radiation.

Find lost coins using the metal collector near the signs I've placed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]
* [[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
I like gold, let's find some!

==Completion==
You got the coins, and only mild radiation poisoning.

==Notes==
Pick up all of [[Anchors Aweigh Too Much]], [[Not On Our Payroll]] and [[Bomb Beats Rock]] before heading out.

While out and about, look for [[Crushtacean]] at {{co|51.2|55.4|Stormsong Valley}} in a cave off on the eastern side of the quest area. It drops the [[Bonesplinter Band]] and some [[Azerite (resource)]].

Use the quest item near signs in the [[Drowned Lands]] that say "Could be coins here!"

==Progression==
