Meet [[Raimond Mildenhall]] in his Raimond's Laboratory.{{sic}}

==Description==
Our work here is done!

Well, at least until another one of my humble experiments goes horribly awry, rapidly spiraling out of control into a chain reaction of catastrophic failures.

But, let's worry about that another time, <name>.

I'll meet you back at my lab!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Luminous Honey Jar]]
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Well, we had quite the adventure <name>.

Let's try not to do that again anytime soon though!

==Notes==
On accept:

Back to the basement.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Raimond Mildenhall|Well, Ancel... I hope you'll let this serve as an important lesson.}}
:{{text|say|Ancel Mildenhall|A lesson for what!?}}
:{{text|say|Raimond Mildenhall|That it's up to us to push forward the art of honey production, no matter the cost!}}
:{{text|say|Ancel Mildenhall|W-w-what are you talking about!? You nearly got yourself killed and ruined the entire farm in the process!}}
:{{text|say|Raimond Mildenhall|Ha ha! Don't worry my dear Ancel, it's [[merely a setback]]! We'll be back up and running in no time.}}
