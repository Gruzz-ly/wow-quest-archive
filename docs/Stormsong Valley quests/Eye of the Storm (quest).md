==Objectives==
Escort Tideguard Victoria.
* Escort [[Tideguard Victoria]]
* [[Whirling Torrent]] taken {{co|67.9|35.4|Stormsong Valley}}
*Speak to Brother Pike at the Path of Storms.

==Description==
If [[Lord Stormsong]] wasn't aware of you yet, he is now. Your best shot is to reach him at the [[Shrine of the Storm]] before more of his followers fall back to his defense.

I can get you in, but you'll have to protect me. I'm in no shape to take down any more of these fiends.

And try to keep a low profile. The closer we get to the Shrine, the more power Lord Stormsong has at his disposal.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
This is the only way into the Shrine of the Storm.

==Notes==
Speak with Victoria to begin.

:{{Gossip|I am ready.}}
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|Tidesages walk this ceremonial path on their way to be blessed at the shrine.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Is that... good?}}
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|It's direct.}}
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|It will be good if Stormsong doesn't notice us taking it.}}

An ambush at {{co|62.7|35.4|Stormsong Valley}} of two [[Veiled Cutthroat]] and a [[Drowned Harbinger]]:
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|We've got company!}}

Defeat them:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Was Lord Stormsong always this cruel?}}
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|Not at all. He was so kind before the whispers took him.}}
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|It was his father who guided us to this valley, many years ago.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Stormsong|And it is I who will deliver us to our glorious future beneath the tides.}}

Another ambush at {{co|64.2|36.1|Stormsong Valley}} of four [[Raging Storm]]s. Defeat them:
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|We just need to reach the altar ahead.}}
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|Come on, we're almost there!}}
:{{text|say|Lord Stormsong|You think you stand in my way, but Kul Tiras's fate was sealed long ago.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Stormsong|Give them a taste of our new allies' power.}}
:{{text|say|Sister Paxton|Your soul will know only hunger.}}
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|I... I don't think I can go on.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|It's only a few more steps. We're not leaving you behind!}}
:{{text|say|Drowned Hierarch|You will face... the eye... of the storm...}}

At {{co|65.3|35.4|Stormsong Valley}} defeat [[Sister Paxton]], some [[Drowned Hierarch]]s, and some [[Abyssal Spawn]]s:
:{{text|say|Lord Stormsong|The Kul Tiran fleet bows to my will. And now, so will you.}}
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|Run. RUN!}}
:''Victoria summons a wall of water, putting a barrier between herself, the Taelia, and the adventurer from an [[Umbral Hulk]] and a bunch of [[Veiled Cutthroat]]s and [[Drowned Harbinger]]s.''
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|I'll hold them off for as long as I can.}}
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|I won't be able to hold them for long. Take the rod and get out of here!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|We're not leaving you to die!}}
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|You have to, or we are all lost. Now go!}}
:''Taelia takes the [[Whirling Torrent]].''

Follow her to reach the [[Path of Storms]]:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Victoria! She... didn't make it...}}
:{{text|say|Samuel Williams|Endless shadow... a thousand arms...}}
:{{text|say|Samuel Williams|Four eyes... the end... she rises!}}
