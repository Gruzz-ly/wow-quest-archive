==Objectives==
Meet [[Taelia]] in [[Brennadam]].

==Description==
Let's get to Brennadam right away. We need to find [[Brother Pike]] and get to the bottom of all of this before things get any worse.

This road should take us right into town. Brennadam's the busiest market this side of [[Boralus]], so there should be plenty of people there who can help us find Pike.

Ready when you are!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94}}
*1,650 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]
*[[Brennadam Coop]]

==Completion==
Looks like more trouble.

==Notes==
On accept, Taelia mounts up and takes off. Keep up!
:{{text|say|Taelia|The pass is the only land route into the valley. House Stormsong is up to something.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Isn't the valley majestic? No wonder so many people settle down here.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Brennadam is the largest trade hub in Kul Tiras outside of Boralus.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|We need to find Brother Pike right away. Hopefully he can help us bring the fleet home.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|All of Kul Tiras is exposed without it. It's only a matter of time before we're attacked.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Brennadam is just ahead. Come on!}}

Things are not well in town, as a group of pitchfork and torch-wielding [[Brennadam Citizen]]s are staring down Brother Pike:
:{{text|say|Brennadam Citizen|The militia hasn't been on patrol in days!}}
:{{text|say|Brennadam Citizen|Too busy taking our harvest "for the soldiers"!}}
:{{text|say|Brennadam Citizen|We demand answers, Pike!}}

This concludes the "The Tidesages of Stormsong" chapter of the [[Stormsong Valley storyline]]. The quest chain continues with [[A Risky Ploy]].

Make sure to pick up the flight path in town!

The optional [[Brennadam]] side quest chain starts from [[Marilyn Hood]] in town with [[Circle the Wagons]]. See that article for more information.
