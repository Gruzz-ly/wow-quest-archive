==Objectives==
Retrieve the [[Rod of Tides]].
* Rod of Tides claimed {{co|59.1|38.7|Stormsong Valley}}
* Rod of Tides

==Description==
I took oaths, damn it. We all did.

When [[Lord Stormsong]] sent the first orders... well, you saw what happened. What matters is that our oaths are to our people, not Lord "Sells His Soul".

You won't find him here - he's deep in the [[Shrine of the Storm|Shrine]] by now, and no outsider will make it across the channel alive...

Not without a Tideguard to open the way.

<[[Tideguard Victoria|Victoria]] locks eyes with you.>

The Rod of Tides is the key to the front door, and it's kept here. Retrieve it and I can get you to him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
You do have the rod, right?

==Completion==
I see it deemed you worthy. Good.

==Notes==
While in [[Sagehold]] for [[Twisted Intentions]] and [[The Storm Awakens]], find [[Tideguard Victoria]] left for dead just outside a house. She offers this quest.

On approach:
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|You, there! My friends left me here for dead. Lend a hand?}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Tideguard Victoria|Find me north of this hellhole once you have the rod. Look for a pile of these dead bastards.}}

==Progression==
{{At the Edge of Madness}}
