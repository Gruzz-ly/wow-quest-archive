'''Unbeelievable Quality''' is a weekly quest that turns 35x [[Royal Jelly (Stormsong Valley)]] into 850 rep with [[Storm's Wake]] and a jug of [[Mildenhall Mead]].

In order to purchase the [[Collected Tidebloom Honey]] from the [[Honeyback Hivemother]], players must be exalted with the [[Honeyback Hive]] and have acquired the [[Honeyback Harvester's Harness]] from [[Leaving the Hive]] by maxing out friendship with the bee.

==Objectives==
Take the Collected Tidebloom Honey to [["Nasty" Buck]] in [[Brennadam]].
* [[Collected Tidebloom Honey]] (provided)

==Description==
<Now that your harvester has matured, the Honeyback hive is creating additional honey.

Someone in Brennadam could certainly find a use for this honey.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Mildenhall Mead]]
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* +850 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
I don't believe it! Honey from bees instead of those... blobs... at [[Mildenhall Meadery|the meadery]]?

I'll make sure this gets to [[Raimond Mildenhall|Raimond]].

==Patch changes==
