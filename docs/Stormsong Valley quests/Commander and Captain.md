==Objectives==
Kill Captain Malia and recover the Book of Forbidden Magics from [[Commander Augustine]].
* [[Captain Malia]] slain
* [[Book of Forbidden Magics]]

==Description==
This brings me no joy, <name>, but I will do what I must to make sure my family is happy and safe.

I would prefer we avoid violence, but if we must... there are two targets. Their leaders. Captain Malia and Commander Augustine.

Their loss should force the two groups to retreat from the area.

Also, Augustine confiscated a book of mine. Recover it and my powers are yours, for however long I have left.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with the [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
I don't need the details of what happened down there. Just the book.

==Completion==
I won't dwell on the grim task you've done. But I will show you just what this dying man is capable of, now that I have my book.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting [[Commander and Captain]], [[They Will Know Fear]] and [[Scattering Our Enemies]]
:{{Text|Say|[[Thomas Zelling]]|<wheeze> You're not concerned I may attack you? Try to run?}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Lilian Voss]]|You'd be dead before your next pathetic cough, Zelling. Care to test me?}}
:{{Text|Say|Thomas Zelling|No, but can you answer my question? When you become [[Forsaken]], are you purged of any sicknesses?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lilian Voss|Becoming Forsaken is an unpredictable process. Your body and mind are certain to change, but to what extent... it's impossible to know. As is how well you will cope with the process.}}
:{{Text|Say|Thomas Zelling|Did [[Captain Amalia Stone|Captain Stone]] go mad when she turned? I'm well aware of what happened to her.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lilian Voss|We all go a little mad when we become Forsaken. Some more than others.}}
