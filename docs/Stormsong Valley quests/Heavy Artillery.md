==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Commander Wormwood.jpg|Commander Wormwood|He must be tough if he's been selected to pilot their experimental weapon. Be careful!}}
Slay Captain Wormwood and commandeer the Experimental War Machine.
* [[Commander Wormwood]] slain {{co|56.3|58.3|Stormsong Valley}}
*[[Horde]] forces destroyed (0/100%)
* Activate the Self Destruct

==Description==
Bad news, friend. They're bringing in serious firepower now.

We've spotted a tank on the northern hill by the windmill. They can reach the other side of the town from there. We can't let them set it up.

What do you say to giving them a taste of their own medicine? If you can take out their commander, you'd have a fancy new tank all to yourself. Imagine the mayhem you could unleash on their invasion!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Tidespeaker Pants
|Darkwater Legwraps
|Stormchaser Greaves
|Dread Corsair Wargreaves
|Tidespeaker Cord
|Darkwater Cinch

|Dread Corsair Greatbelt
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
If that cannon can reach [[Brennadam]], it can reach those zeppelins!

==Completion==
Those were some explosions! I'm just glad they were directed at the Horde and not us.

==Notes==
Head for the windmill northeast of town to find [[Tank Engineer]]s, the war machine, and Commander Wormwood.

Defeat the engineers to make Commander Wormwood attackable. Kill him, then hop in the [[Experimental War Machine]]. It has two abilities:
*{{abilities|Azerite Cannon|range=200|Fire a projectile infused with Azerite. Dangerous and unpredictable!|notes=2 sec cast|id=273378}}
*{{abilities|Self Destruct|range=10|notes=2 sec cast}}

Progress:
* [[Demolisher (Stormsong Valley)|Demolisher]] slain (5-6%)
* [[Siege Tower (Stormsong Valley)|Siege Tower]] slain (11%)
* [[Orc Raider (Stormsong Valley)|Orc Raider]] slain (4%)
* [[Bloodthirsty Headhunter]] slain (2%)
* [[Rampaging Grunt]] slain (2%)
* [[Wind Rider Bombardier]] slain (2%)
* [[Sapper Technician]] slain (3%)

Destroy everything that moves, then activate the Self Destruct.

This concludes the Battle for Brennadam chapter of the [[Stormsong Valley storyline]]. The quest-givers offer breadcrumbs to other hubs in the zone: [[There's Gold in Them There Fields]], [[Checking Out the Collapse]], [[Survivors]], [[Trouble at Fort Daelin]].

Additionally, there are a few other side quests in Brennadam: [[Circle the Wagons]] and [[Sometimes Less Is More]].
