==Objectives==
Retrieve 5 Stolen Crates.
* [[Stolen Crate (item)]] (5)

==Description==
<This empty crate of supplies is clearly marked with [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] signage. These must be the spoils of their raids on the [[farm]]s of the [[Stormsong Valley|valley]].

The citizens would probably like their supplies back if there are any left.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
*[[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Keep an eye out for anything useful. This place is very dangerous.

==Completion==
It's not stealing if we're stealing them back. Hey! Are those my lucky anchors?

==Notes==
*While on [[Quilltop]] in [[Briarback Kraul]] for [[War Pigs]] and [[Run For the Hills]], keep an eye out for the Empty Crate, which starts this quest.

==Progression==
{{Briarback Kraul}}
