==Objectives==
Enter the basement.
*Examine [[Mead Barrel]]
* [[The Brue]] slain

==Description==
We checked everywhere... well, <gulps> everywhere except the basement.

B-b-but, [[Raimond Mildenhall|dad]] told me never to go down there.

He said it's dark, scary, and dangerous to go alone... I could be eaten by a brue!

I don't even know what that is, but I don't wanna be eaten! 

<Name>, do you think you could go down first?

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Apiarist's Protective Drape
|Honey-Artisan's Ring
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
I don't know if we should be doing this...

==Completion==
The brue, I saw it. He didn't make it up!!

==Notes and trivia==
The basement is on the side of the mead hall where the Crystallized Honey Fragment was located in the previous quest.

Downstairs, inspect the [[Mead Barrel]]:
:{{text|say|Ancel Mildenhall|Aaaahhh!!! The Brue!}}

The brue refers to the {{wp|Grue (monster)|Grue}}, a fictional monster that dwells in the dark, first seen in ''{{wp|Dying Earth}}'', but more commonly known as an enemy in ''{{wp|Zork}}''.
