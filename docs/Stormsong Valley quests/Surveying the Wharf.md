==Objectives==
Speak to [[Coxswain Hook]] in [[Thresher's Wharf]].

==Description==
Thresher's Wharf is a bustling fishing hub just across the delta from [[Fort Daelin]]. 

It was also in the direct war path of the [[naga]] -- who knows what remains now.

If you could stop in and check in on its leader, Coxswain Hook, you'd have my gratitude. I must focus on tending to the wounded here and preparing for the naga's next assault.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ah, just what I needed. A fresh set o' ears to hear a tale or two!

==Progression==
