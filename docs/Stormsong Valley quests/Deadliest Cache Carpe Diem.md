*{{Text|say|Coxswain Hook|Is that all you got?}}
*{{Text|say|Coxswain Hook|How's that fer chummin' the waters?}}

Then head to the upper dock and use the Spyglass to scan the horizon.
:{{Text|say|Coxswain Hook|Then I saw it, approachin' from the horizon. A beast unlike any I'd ever seen!}}

A void-corrupted whale shark, [[Barathruum]], starts flying toward the wharf! Use the Final Stand ability:
*{{abilities|Final Stand|Stand tall against certain demise.|notes=1 sec cast|id=278804}}
:{{text|say|Coxwain Hook|Is that all you got?}}
:{{text|say|Coxwain Hook|Thanks to my razor-sharp wit, I knew exactly how to cut the beast down.}}
