==Objectives==
Go into the [[Shrine of the Storm|Shrine of the Storms]], recover the Ritual of Safe Passage and defeat Vol'zith the Whisperer.
* [[Ritual of Safe Passage]]
* [[Vol'zith the Whisperer]] slain
* Find [[Brother Pike]] in the [[Crescent Cove]] on the coast of [[Stormsong Valley|Stormsong]].
* [[Staff of Storms#Shrine of the Storm: The Missing Ritual]] (provided)
* Suggested players: 5

==Description==
The ritual which allows safe passage to [[Fate's End]] is a closely guarded secret to keep the curious from venturing there and suffering the same fate as the condemned. I have never conducted it before, but there is a scroll with instructions.

It is held in the Shrine of the Storms. To access the scroll, use the staff you have empowered to break the dark energy surrounding it.

Collect the Ritual of Safe Passage and bring it to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|93|60|}}
* [[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (600x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Were you able to recover the Ritual of Safe Passage?

==Completion==
Good! Time is of the essence if we are to save [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Jaina]]. I have made what preparations I can. Allow me a moment to read through the ritual and then we may begin.

==Progression==
{{The Pride of Kul Tiras}}
