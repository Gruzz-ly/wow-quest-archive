==Notes==
;Speaking with Line
:Speak yer mind.
{{Gossip|And then what happened?}}
:{{text|say|Master Gunner Line|Aye, I remember it well. It was [[Pilgrim's Bounty]], and I was fishin' up the main course fer the banquet.}}
:{{text|say|Master Gunner Line|It was then I realized I had forgotten me fishin' rod! A fisherman's only as good as their rod, if you ask me.}}
:{{text|say|Master Gunner Line|Tides take me, I forgot me rod!}}

*{{text|say|Master Gunner Line|Just, uh, wanted to admire the view a second longer.}} (if idle)
*{{text|say|Master Gunner Line|Now this is what I call fishin'!}}
*{{text|say|Master Gunner Line|Like shootin' fish in a barrel!}}
*{{text|say|Master Gunner Line|Bullseye! Er, fisheye!}}

The [[Slagshot Slammer]] is leaning against the barrel Line was sitting on:
:{{text|say|Master Gunner Line|Anywho, like I was sayin', we needed fish fer the bounty, and lots of it, so off I went.}}

Players have access to two abilities as Line:
#{{abilities|Cast the Line|range=40|Inflicts Fire damage to an enemy.|notes=Instant|id=262883}}
#{{abilities|Fly Fishing|cd=8 sec|Thrusts upward, dealing Fire damage to nearby enemies.|notes=Instant|id=275266}}

Start killing 25 [[Drowned Horror]]s, and using the [[Slagshot Fishflayer]]s on the docks to gather three Mountains of fish:
:{{text|say|Master Gunner Line|All me fishin' caught the hungry eye of none other than the leviathan [[Ozumat]]!}}
:{{text|say|Master Gunner Line|Ozumat?! Not on my wharf!}}

A handful of [[Writhing Horror (Stormsong Valley)|Writhing Horror]] tentacles have popped up, and Ozumat's visible in the distance. Take out four tentacles:
:{{text|say|Master Gunner Line|With the beast's tentacles subdued, it was time to finish the job.}}
:{{text|say|Master Gunner Line|Luckily, I had me special bullet I kept 'round me neck at all times for just such an occasion.}}
:{{text|say|Master Gunner Line|Time to seal the deal!}}

*{{abilities|Seal the Deal|range=200|Instantly kill the target.|notes=3 sec cast|id=262887}}

Take the shot from wherever.
:{{text|say|Master Gunner Line|And that is how I hoisted the very fiend of the dark below to this very mast!}}
:{{text|say|"Sinker"|Mph mph mph!}}
:{{text|say|Coxwain Hook|Aye, Sinker's got a point. Ozumat ain't been seen since the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]]!}}
:{{text|say|"Sinker"|Mph mph, mph mph mph!}}
:{{text|say|Coxwain Hook|Ah, and Sinker's got a tale o' his own!}}
