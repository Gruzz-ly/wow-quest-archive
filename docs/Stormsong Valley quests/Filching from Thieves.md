==Objectives==
Collect 7 Tidal Beacons.
* [[Tidal Beacon]] (7)

==Description==
The [[naga]] oft take what they want with little care for who they are taking it from. Perhaps we should do the same for them.

The sorceresses use powerful beacons to assist with their spellcasting. I could use these relics to strengthen my own ritual.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Make sure you don't drop any of the beacons. I cannot say I know what will happen.

==Completion==
Ah! How powerful! These will be a great help.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Eeling in a Big One]], [[Facing the Invaders]] and [[Reclaiming our Defenses]] before heading out.

Head north and start killing everything, including the rare sea giant [[Seabreaker Skoloth]].

==Progression==
{{From the Depths}}
