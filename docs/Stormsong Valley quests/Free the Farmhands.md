==Objectives==
Rescue the Honey Encased Farmhands.
*[[Honey Encased Farmhand]] rescued (8)

==Description==
We were running around trying to get the farm under control, but the [[bee]]s, oh my goodness, the bees!

The giant monstrosities came out of nowhere and started dousing everyone in honey.

I came up here to find [[Raimond Mildenhall|Raimond]], but before I knew it, I was covered too.

Then, the strangest thing happened, the honey started growing around me!

Please, the other farmhands are still in trouble, you've got to help them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Interesting, the self replicating properties of the honey have been accelerating...

==Completion==
Encased in honey, just waiting to be eaten. That must have been absolutely terrifying!

==Notes==
Pick up all of [[Fetching Wrex]], [[The Bee Team]] and [[Wendigo Away]] before heading out.
