This is no time for idle chatter, <name>. We're being attacked!

==Notes==
On accept, a cutscene.
:''The shield fades, and a small blue sphere of watery energy grows, then rapidly expands to white out the screen. From the the whirlpool left behind, a massive, monstrous Pride of Azshara slowy rises as [[Queen Azshara]] speaks.''
:{{text|say|Queen Azshara|How tenacious! Feel honor in your accomplishment of living long enough to face my pride.}}
: ''The Pride lets lose a vicious roar.''

Don't fall off the wall!

Run between the three [[Cannon (Stormsong Valley)|cannons]] facing the Pride of Azshara and use them as they come off cooldown. Feel free to use any ranged abilities as well.

This concludes the "From the Depths They Come" chapter of the [[Stormsong Valley storyline]]. There are outbound breadcrumbs back to Brennadam with [[Back to Brennadam]] and [[Thresher's Wharf]] from [[Lieutenant Harris]] with [[Surveying the Wharf]].
