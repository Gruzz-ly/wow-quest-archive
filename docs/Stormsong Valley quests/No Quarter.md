==Objectives==
Kill 8 Skeletal Sailors and 4 Tidesage Seacallers.
* [[Skeleton]]s slain (8)
* [[Tidesage Seacaller]] slain (4)

==Description==
We arrived just in time. These abominations have already taken control of the docks; we're all that's left to keep them at bay!

You need to cull their numbers before we're overwhelmed. We don't exactly have an army here!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
We can't hold this forever!

==Completion==
We're holding out alright thanks to you, but [[Samuel Williams|Sam]] is still missing!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Beneath the Veil]] from [[Brother Pike]] before heading out.

While killing mobs in the area, one of them will drop the [[Frothing Vial]], which starts [[A Bloody Mess]]. 

At the north end of the quest area, watch out for [[Dagrus the Scorned]], a rare giant.

Skeletons include:
*[[Drowned Harpooner]]
*[[Risen Bloodhound]]
*[[Tidebound Corsair]]

==Progression==
{{From the Depths They Come}}
