==Objectives==
Slay Force Commanders Ogarth and Durmok.
* [[Ogarth Axefall]] slain {{co|56.9|46.8|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Durmok Darkmane]] slain {{co|59.1|48.6|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Scent Vial]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Horde]] spilled a lot of blood in [[Brennadam]]. Now it's time to spill some more.

The scent of blood makes predators in these hills go crazy. We use it to lure animals when hunting.

The Horde forces are occupying caves up in the hills. Toss these scent vials into the caves where the Force Commanders organize the attack. The smell should bring all the hills down upon them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]
* [[Small Azerite Fragment]] (50x [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
Those scent vials should help you eliminate both Force Commanders.

==Completion==
With you around, they won't try this again.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Dangerous Game]] and [[Never Outgunned]] before heading out. Optionally, the wanted poster offers [[WANTED: Yarsel'ghun]] as well.

While killing [[Forsaken Keenblade]]s in the [[Windshorn Hills]], look almost due east of the [[Eckhart Lodge]] to find a [[Cannon (Stormsong Valley)|Cannon]] at {{co|60.2|54.6|Stormsong Valley}}. It starts [[Bring out the Big Gun]].

Keep an eye out for [[Taja the Tidehowler]], a rare at {{co|60.0|45.8|Stormsong Valley}} high in the hills.

The named NPCs are in caves fairly high up on the hill. Use the quest item to summon animals to attack the enemies.
