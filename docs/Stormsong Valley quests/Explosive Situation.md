==Objectives==
Collect 5 Bot Buster Bombs.
* [[Bot Buster Bomb]] (5)

==Description==
<This crate has fallen into the water. It contains [[bomb]]s built to take out large mechanical devices.>

<If we had more of them, we could destroy the [[Venture Company]]'s [[Reef Breaker]].>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
You'll need more of these bombs if we want to destroy the Reef Breaker.

==Completion==
Many battles are won by those who take the initiative and exploit an opportunity. You have spotted an excellent opportunity.  

Now you should exploit it!

==Notes==
While gathering seaweed in the [[Jeweled Coast]] for [[Flavorable Offering]], keep an eye out for the [[Bot Buster Bomb]] that starts this quest.

On the surface at the northeast end of the quest area is [[Slickspill]], a rare oil elemental that drops the [[Living Oil Canister]].
