==Objectives==
Collect 8 Vials of Honey Slime and mix them with [[:Raimond's Secret Ingredient]] to make [[Mildenhall's Growth Formula]], then feed it to [[Bumbles]].
* [[Vial of Honey Slime]] (8)
*[[Mildenhall Growth Formula]]
*Formula Fed to Bumbles

==Description==
We just need to collect some slime from the animated honey creatures that are still roaming around the farm.

If you can bring back a few vials of that, we can put all our ingredients together and give the mixture to Bumbles.

We should only feed him once a day, or he might get sick like some of the other bees.

We're gonna have him all healed up in no time!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Did you collect enough of the slime?

==Completion==
He's looking so much better!

==Notes==
The vials can drop from any of the [[Bubbling Mead]], [[Flowing Honey]], and [[Honey-Crazed Mauler]]s. Once you have enough, return to the cellar and use the purple bottle that's located behind Ancel. Bumbles is located beside Ancel.

Doing this quest seven times awards [[Let's Bee Friends (achievement)]] and [[Bumbles]].
