==Objectives==
Collect 6 Wetshell Turtles.
* [[Wetshell Turtle]]s Collected (6)

==Description==
[[Deadwash|This town]] is a horrible place full of bad people. All they care about is money! No one cares about the [[turtle]]s!

The turtles are out there, thirsty, drying up, and getting stepped on by monsters!

You have to save the turtles for me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Save the turtles.

==Completion==
They're still moving! [[Emma Haribull|Emma's]] going to be so happy they are still fresh!

==Notes==
Before heading out to the [[Briny Flats]], complete [[Don't Turtle]] and pick up [[Earl-E Bot Gets the Worm]].

On the flats, look for [[Pinku'shon]], a rare hermit crab, at {{co|38.1|50.8|Stormsong Valley}} in the northwest end of the quest area.

Looting [[Wetshell Turtle]]s will aggro [[Wetshell Matriarch]]es, so watch out.

;Upon completion
:''Grettle Haribull walks inside to reveal the ultimate deception.''
