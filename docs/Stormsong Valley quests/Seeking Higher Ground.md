==Objectives==
Meet [[Kelsey Steelspark]] on the hill south of [[Warfang Hold]].

==Description==
We've only got one shot at reestablishing our communication network, so we've got to pick the right spot and I found just the right place!

While you've been busy down here, I set up some camouflage and hauled the bulk of the machinery up there.

What? Did you think I was just sitting here polishing my knives while you were gone?

Well, okay I did that too. Anyway, I'll meet you up the hill!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Once we get the listening post set up again, we won't have the range to reach [[Boralus]], but we'll have plenty of power to get in touch with [[Mathias Shaw|Master Shaw]]!
