==Objectives==
Find [[Farmer Goldfield]] at his farm.

==Description==
We've still got some folks missing, and I could use your help finding them.

While [[Brennadam]] is now secure, I worry for some of our farms closer to the [[quilboar]] kraul. We relied on the militia in the past to keep the quilboar back, but now that they've retreated to the east I worry that our outlying farms are in danger.

Goldfield's farm is almost directly south of us, up the hill by the falls. While it's not surprising that he hasn't left, I would feel better if you checked in.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
Roz always worries about me. I keep tellin' her I'm fine up here, but she never listens...

==Notes==
While passing through the [[Amber Waves]] on the way to [[Briarback Kraul]] and farmers [[Farmer Burton|Burton]] and [[Farmer Goldfield|Goldfield]], keep an eye out for [[Farmer Max]] at {{co|55.0|68.0|Stormsong Valley}}. He offers some side quests: [[Raiders of the Lost Crop]] and [[Grain Drain]].

Also, in the Amber Waves town, [[Houndmaster Archibald]] offers some other standalone side-quests [[Follow Your Nose]] and [[Sic 'Em!]]

==Progression==
