==Notes==
Speak with the [[Shadow Hunter Scout]]

:They sent you to do the job? Oh, dis is gonna be good...

:Ya job be simple, mon: get in there, find the target, and take 'em out. We know they be in there somewhere. My job be to give you the voodoo to sneak by the guards, but watch out for the sentries. They can see you, so ya still gotta be sneaky.

:I be givin' ya one smoke bomb for when ya finish de mission. Use it to get outta dere!

:{{Gossip|I am ready.}}

Gossip after speaking
:Good hunting, mon. You get spotted, you make it back to me or one of de other scouts and we can do de voodoo on you again.

Avoid [[Wary Sentry|Wary Sentries]] in [[Fort Daelin]]. After the target is killed, you can use Smoke Bomb to be returned to the scout.
