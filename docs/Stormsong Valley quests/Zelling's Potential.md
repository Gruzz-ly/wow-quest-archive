==Description==
<cough> My body won't last much longer, but [[Lilian Voss|Miss Voss]] insists I display what my powers truly are.

I can instill within you a <cough> <wheeze> magical font that will absorb [[void]] essence from slain creatures.

Go to <cough> Port Fogtide. There you will find those tainted by the Void.

Slay them, fill the font, and you will <wheeze> see my magic at work.
