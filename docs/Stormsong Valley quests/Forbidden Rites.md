==Objectives==
Kill 15 K'thir and disrupt 6 rituals.
* [[K'thir]] slain (15)
* Rituals disrupted (6)

==Description==
These k'thir have been hiding among us, sewing the seeds of their dark masters with us none the wiser.

With the barrier around the [[Abyssal Melody]] lowered I can peer within; its bowels toil with my own people giving themselves to the shadow!

Take my tidal kris; its blade is now coated in purified tideblood. Put an end to these fiends and their foul rituals.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
These horrors must be destroyed.

==Completion==
Good. Each death brings this valley one step closer to redemption.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Gathering Storm (quest)]] and [[From the Maw of Madness]] before heading out.

Use the [[Tidal Kris]] near [[Fanatical Acolyte]]s to disrupt the ritual and kill them.

K'thir for this quest include [[Abyssal Corruptor]]s and [[Risen Cultist]]s.

==Progression==
{{From the Depths They Come}}
