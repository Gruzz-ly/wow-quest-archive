==Objectives==
Eliminate 10 Restless Stones.
* [[Restless Stone]] slain (10)

==Description==
The workers are complaining about [[elemental]]s coming into the area while they're digging for treasure. 

Just this morning, I had two people crushed to death! It's slowing down the hunt! 

You can earn your share by getting rid of those elementals!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Do what I say, we'll get along a lot better!

==Completion==
I almost trust you <race>.

==Notes==
Pick up all of [[Anchors Aweigh Too Much]], [[Fun With Magnets]] and [[Bomb Beats Rock]] before heading out.

While out and about, look for [[Crushtacean]] at {{co|51.2|55.4|Stormsong Valley}} in a cave off on the eastern side of the quest area. It drops the [[Bonesplinter Band]] and some [[Azerite (resource)]].

Ship parts and restless stones carpet the area.

==Progression==
{{Treasure in Deadwash}}
