==Objectives==
Save 8 stranded battalion soldiers.
* [[Stranded Battalion Soldier|Battalion Soldiers]] saved (8)

==Description==
We were holding off the [[naga]] up until the latest attack. A few of our forces are still out there.

The tidemaidens seem to be slowly torturing them to death. If you could save as many as you can find, we'd be one step closer to gaining the upper ground again.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Proudmoore Battalion Cloak
|Tidespeaker Footwraps
|Darkwater Footpads
|Stormchaser Treads
|Dread Corsair Boots
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Did you find any of our soldiers?

==Completion==
That should slow down their progress quite a bit. You have my gratitude.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Eeling in a Big One]], [[Filching from Thieves]] and [[Facing the Invaders]] before heading out.

Head north and start killing everything, including the rare sea giant [[Seabreaker Skoloth]].

After being rescued, they join you as Battalion Soldier guardians for a few seconds.
