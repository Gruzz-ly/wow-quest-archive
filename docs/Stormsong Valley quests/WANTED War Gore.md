==Objectives==
{{questportrait|War Gore.jpg|War Gore|Horrible creation made from the bodies of Stormsong citizens.}}
Find and kill War Gore
* [[War Gore]] slain {{co|47.4|34.0|Stormsong Valley}}
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
By the decree of the [[Storm's Wake]].

Scouts have reported that [[forsaken]] scientists have created a monster, sewn together from the bodies of our own fallen soldiers. 

This monstrosity is called, War Gore.

The individual that destroys this [[abomination]] will earn a fitting reward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* [[Small Azerite Shard]] (115x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 24,680 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
The wanted poster is nailed to the wall, with tasks etched on it.

==Completion==
One less threat to safety of Stormsong.

==Notes==
Consider saving this until while also on [[Eye for an Eye (Stormsong Valley)]].

The path to War Gore starts just north of the mouth of the [[Saltstone Mine]]. Run up hill and west of the tower at [[Warfang Hold]] to reach a small waterfall. [[War Gore]], and a [[Forsaken Butcher]] and a [[Forsaken Surgeon]] are in the cave, the [[Screaming Pit]].

If in the shredder, the flamethrower does nothing. Just spam Forked Lightning. The damage dealt during the heal (Overcharge) also deals a big chunk of damage.

==Progression==
{{Cycle of Hatred}}
