==Objectives==
Use the Cleansing Thurible to purge 13 sources of corruption.
* Sources of corruption cleansed (13)
* [[Cleansing Thurible]] (provided)

==Description==
The air is foul with corruption. It must be dealt with.

The [[tidesages]] were fools, and I a fool to trust them. Belief in their god to perform miracles and deliver us from our folly. Nevertheless, their methods did serve to drive back the foul presence from these cliffs.

A simple censer, loaded with select powders and oils. The vapors produce an effect that expels the miasma, if only for a time.

Perhaps their ineffectual gesticulation will finally serve a purpose.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I can smell the pungent stench from here.

==Completion==
The foul odor is dispersed. Perhaps reality can once more take root in this place.

== Notes ==
The spots of corruption are tracked on your minimap. There are clusters of two in each cave, but there should be enough around outside so that you can avoid the caves altogether.

* The next quest will become available anytime between one to three days.

==Progression==
{{Forgotten Cove}}
