==Objectives==
Confront [[Lord Stormsong]].
* [[Azshj'thul the Drowned]] slain

==Description==
I've no doubt he can feel our presence, but so long as Lord Stormsong maintains his spell the first move is ours. 

We have him surrounded, cornered like the rat he is. We must end this together.

* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
Samuel was a good man, with a true heart. A fool... but our fool.

==Notes==
On accept, a cutscene plays out:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|It's over, Stormsong! Look around you... you're surrounded!}}
:{{text|say|Lord Stormsong|All I see are lost souls, crying for release.}}
:''Stormsong channels a spell, killing all of the Awakened Conscripts around him.''
:{{text|say|Samuel Williams|STORMSONG!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Sam, no!}}
:''Samuel Williams rushes in, but Stormsong easily stops him in his tracks.''
:{{text|say|Lord Stormsong|You brought your end with you, Pike. I must deliver the fleet to our glorious savior, [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]].}}
:''As Stormsong teleports away, Sam tries to fight off the corruption, but fails and arises in the form of [[Azshj'thul the Drowned]].

Taelia will tank and Pike will assist.

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Sam, I know you're in there. You have to fight this!}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|He is lost! All that remains is darkness.}}
:{{text|say|Azshj'thul the Drowned|[Shath'Yar] Hoq aN'qov huqth erh'ongg thoq shanDai h'lwn}}
:{{text|whisper|Azshj'thul the Drowned|The sunken realm welcomes your yawning souls.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Quickly, to me!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|All this pain and suffering is your fault. MONSTER!}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Do not let it in to your mind. Stay strong!}}
:{{text|say|Azshj'thul the Drowned|[Shath'Yar] Og h'iwn Og vormos Hoq sshoq'meg thoq wotH'gl}}
:{{text|whisper|Azshj'thul the Drowned|[Shath'Yar] No light. No escape. The forgotten king returns.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|I will shield us from its assault!}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Let this be a message to your masters. The Storm's Wake will never waver!}}

Defeat him:
:{{text|say|Azshj'thul the Drowned|[Shath'Yar] Za uul og nuq i fssh zz oou iiyoq ez oou gul'kafh anagg}}
:{{text|whisper|Azshj'thul the Drowned|[Shath'Yar] My fall is but a beat in the heart of the infinite abyss.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Sam... he's... he's gone...}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|But he will not be forgotten. Not so long as we stand.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|It is not safe here. Come, there is an old watch post overlooking the Shrine nearby.}}

This concludes the "At the Edge of Madness" chapter of the [[Stormsong Valley storyline]]. Taelia offers a breadcrumb back to Boralus with [[A New Dawn]], and Pike offers a breadcrumb to the dungeon with [[Shrine of the Storm: Whispers Below]].
