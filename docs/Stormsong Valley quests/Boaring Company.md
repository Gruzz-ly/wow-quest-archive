==Objectives==
Find and rescue 7 Captured [[Farmer]]s and Farmer Deal.
* [[Captured Farmer|Farmers]] rescued (7)
* [[Farmer Deal]] rescued

==Description==
I don't see her body anywhere. That means she could still be alive.

The [[Briarback tribe|Briarback]] have been taking [[prisoner]]s, and anyone who has ever been taken by them was never seen again.

We have a single chance here and we need to take it!

Come with me into the [[Briarback Kraul|kraul]] and free as many of the survivors as you can. And if you can, find Farmer Deal. See if she's still alive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
*[[Small Azerite Fragment]] (75x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Please, find the prisoners!

==Completion==
I was sure they were done for. You have my thanks.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Look Out!]] before heading out.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Sergeant Calvin|I'll go on ahead and search for the farmers. Whatever you do, don't get captured!}}
:{{text|say|[[Mayor Roz]]|We are going to make sure that the [[quilboar]] can never wage war at this scale again.}}

Head up the hill to find the marked cave at {{co|42.4|67.4|Stormsong Valley}} to enter the [[Briarback Kraul]].

Kill a lookout to start [[Anger in a Bottle]] from the dropped [[Foul-Smelling Flask]]. Additionally, just a bit further inside is the [[Brambleguard Totem]], which starts [[Totems, Totems, Totems!]]

Click on [[Earthen Pillar]]s to free the farmers.
