==Objectives==
Collect 12 Irontide Coin Bags.
* [[Irontide Coin Bag]] (12)

==Description==
These [[Irontide Raiders]] think they can just come in and take the treasure we've been hunting for months!

By rights, that treasure is ours! Get in there and get our share of it, before it's gone. 

By share, I mean all of it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
I want every piece of that treasure in there.

==Completion==
I'm going to be a rich man! You're not holding out on me are ya?

==Notes==
Pick up [[We're Not Friends]] and [[The Proof of Piracy]] before heading out.

Just west of McGee is a wagon full of [[Irontide Loot]]. Interact with the chest to start [[All Laid Out For Us]]. Try to pick that quest up as quickly as possible.

Coin Bags are much more commonly found on the ground rather than on the corpses of Irontide sailors.
