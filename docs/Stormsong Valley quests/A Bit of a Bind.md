==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Binder Sa'thress.jpg|Binder Sa'thress|The leader of the attack on the village. She seems to be a powerful mage.}}
Slay Binder Sa'thress.
* [[Binder Sa'thress]] slain {{co|27.8|62.3|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Songstone]]

==Description==
The naga sorceress leading this excursion seems to be in the process of binding a larger elemental. If she succeeds, we will no doubt lose our foothold here.

Strike out at her, perhaps you can catch her off guard and interrupt the ritual. Remove the head from these snakes.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Zeth'jir Seacaller Signet
|Tidespeaker Belt
|Darkwater Waistcord
|Stormchaser Chain
|Dread Corsair Warbelt
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Is the seawitch dead?

==Completion==
I have no idea what this might be, but I don't like the looks of it.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Freedom for the Sea]] and [[A Bit of a Bind]] and [[Caught in the Net]] before heading out.

Kill a path southward, simply killing [[Bound Seasurge]]s, looting naga for [[Fishbone Key]]s to open [[Naga Cage]]s and free villagers, and finding [[Binder Sa'thress]] at the south end of the beach before it turns west.

Defeat her:
