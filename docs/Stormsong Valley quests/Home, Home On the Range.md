==Objectives==
Track down the shipwright in [[Stormsong Valley]] and deliver the [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lord Admiral]]'s Letter.
* [[Letter from the Lord Admiral]] (Provided)
* Find the homestead
* Meet the [[Old Atwater|shipwright]]
* Meet the [[Dorian Atwater|actual shipwright]]

==Description==
<Cyrus peruses a map.>

Hmm... Along the road to [[Fort Daelin]]... to the north... somewhere in the [[Deadwash]].

<He points to a section of road on the map.>

I've marked a spot on your map that seems likely. I think that will get you close enough. 

I'll report back to the Lord Admiral with what we've learned. Good luck, and I hope our shipwright is willing.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Now what's this?

==Completion==
<Dorian takes her time to read over the letter. Her brows steadily rise.>

==Notes==
On accepting this quest:
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|This town's quite the rumor mill. But we've at least narrowed down our search.}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|You're looking for a homestead somewhere in the [[Deadwash]].}}
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|I need to return to [[Harbormaster's Office|my post]] now. Good luck, and don't forget the letter.}}
:''Cyrus leaves the inn and walks toward the [[Anna Skyspirit|flight master]].''

Speak to [[Old Atwater]] at the [[Atwater Stead]]:
:<He doesn't look up from his gardening as you approach.>
:Mind you don't step on the flowers. The wife hates that.
::{{gossip|Are you Dorian Atwater?}}
:''Old Atwater turns to the [[adventurer]], then points to the doorway of the house.''
:{{text|say|Old Atwater|Me? Tides, no. That's my wife. She's inside.}}
:''As Old Atwater returns to his gardening, his name changes to Sal Atwater.''

On approaching [[Dorian Atwater]]:
: ''Dorian sits in a rocking chair in front of the fireplace peeling a box of potatoes, tossing the peeled ones into the hearth. [[Elemental]]s are doing many house chores, with [[Bound Rain]] doing the dishes, [[Bound Hearth]] keeping the place warm and [[Bound Earth]] lifting heavy objects.''
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|My ears still work perfectly fine, you know.}}
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Looking for a shipwright, are you? Too bad. I'm retired.}}
