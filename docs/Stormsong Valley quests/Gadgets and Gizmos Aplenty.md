==Objectives==
Collect 10 Harvester Gizmos.
* [[Harvester Gizmo]] (10)

==Description==
The militia may have given up on us, but we haven't given up on me!

I'm a bit of a [[tinker]], and I find that my [[harvest golem]]s are better than any hired help I've ever had. They just need regular maintenance to keep running.

Of course the [[Briarback tribe|Briarback]] are now taking over my fields, and my farmhands have gone into disrepair.

If you head out into the fields, can you grab the inner mechanisms from any of them that you find? That will stop them from exploding as well as help me plan my revenge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Do you have the parts yet?

==Completion==
Perfect! With these parts I can rebuild my entire workforce. Or make one of them REALLY powerful.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Stop Vining!]] before heading out.

Additionally, the bonus objective [[Weed Whacking]] is available while in the [[Burton Farmstead]]. Don't focus on it right now -- save it to complete during [[Farming Stimulator]].

Interact with [[Malfunctioning Harvester]]s to find a [[Harvester Gizmo]] or two.

While in the caves, look for rare [[quilboar]] [[Captain Razorspine]] at {{co|47.3|65.7|Stormsong Valley}}.

==Progression==
{{Burton Farmstead}}

==Trivia==
The title of this quest, along with the flavor text of the quest items, are references and lyrics to the song "Part of Your World" from The Little Mermaid (1989).
