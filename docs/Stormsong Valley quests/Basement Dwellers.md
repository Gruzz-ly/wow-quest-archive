==Objectives==
Collect 8 Spider Silk from the [[Cellar Crawler]]s.
* [[Spider Silk (quest item)]] (8)

==Description==
Ever since the untimely passing of dear, sweet [[Lizzie's Gravestone|Lizzie]], rest her [[soul]], the pests have multiplied like crazy!

In recent days, giant [[spider]]s have begun crawling out of the cellar underneath the southern mill.

No one has been able to go down there, for fear of being wrapped in web and eaten alive!

Would you mind squashing a few arachnids and collecting any silk you find?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* [[Small Azerite Fragment]] (50x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
If only Lizzie were still here...

==Completion==
We can all rest easier now that those spiders have been squashed.

==Progression==
