Eliminate 10 Venture Co. Flame Starters and 2 Venture Co. Oilers.
* [[Venture Co. Firestarter]] slain (10)
* [[Venture Co. Oiler]] slain (2)

==Description==
These [[Venture Company|Venture Co.]] thugs set flame to the very oils they harvest. They hope to drive us from this land.

Their plan has a flaw. If a great wave extinguished every torch, their oil could not be lit. You can be our great wave!

Extinguish all the flames here, and we shall be victorious this day.

==Completion==
The war has just begun, but it was a great first victory!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Toki|I will tell the tale of your great victory here today. So, uh... be sure to win!}}
