==Objectives==
Meet [[Brother Pike]] and [[Taelia]] at [[Mariner's Strand]].

==Description==
I have little information to offer, I'm afraid. I've scarcely left [[Brennadam]] as of late.

What they said is true. Our militia now enter town only to collect rations rather than guard traders or keep the [[quilboar]] at bay.

They say they are under orders, but those orders would only come from my brothers at the [[Shrine of the Storm|Shrine]]. We take oaths to serve our people... it simply does not add up.

[[Brother Addington]] is nearby at Mariner's Strand. Perhaps he knows more than I.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
*[[Tidesage Necklace]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
What has become of our people...

:{{text|say|Brother Pike|I often wonder whether he is right.}}
:''As the party crosses the bridge to [[Mariner's Strand]], Pike spots [[Brother Addington]] hanging from a crane, and [[Exhausted Laborer]]s are also dead.''
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Addington! By the depths...}}
