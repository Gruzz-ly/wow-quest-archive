==Objectives==
Gather 50 Seaweed.
* [[Seaweed (quest item)]] (50)

==Description==
[[Ai'twen]] saved many [[Tortollan]]s during the great purge of the [[Inky Grotto]]. He rests here in this tranquil bubble as a reward for his service. To entice him back to our world we'll need a flavorful offering.

The seaweed that grows outside is Ai'twen's favorite meal. Its salty flavor will surely coax Ai'twen to leave the bubble for our world. Gather it from the creatures outside this cave, and where it grows wild on the reef.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Search for the Seaweed outside and on [[Makrura Brineshell]]s{{sic}}

==Completion==
An excellent offering.  Let us watch now, and see if this will suffice.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Response Required]] before heading out.

Lithia's on the beach just north of [[Loroja]]'s position.

While gathering Seaweed, be on the lookout for a [[Bot Buster Bomb]] in the water, which starts [[Explosive Situation]].

On the surface at the northeast end of the quest area is [[Slickspill]], a rare oil elemental that drops the [[Living Oil Canister]].

==Progression==
