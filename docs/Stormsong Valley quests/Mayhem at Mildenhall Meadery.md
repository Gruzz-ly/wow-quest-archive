==Description==
Ahhhh! <Sir/Miss>, please, I need some help!

My dad hasn't come back from the meadery and, and... well, when I went to look, there were giant globs of honey everywhere. 

But... but, somehow, they were moving on their own. I even saw one eat a bunny, I swear!

I'm scared to go back by myself, but I think dad is in trouble.

Can you go with me?
