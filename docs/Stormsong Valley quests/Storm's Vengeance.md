==Objectives==
Destroy the [[Abyssal Melody]].
* Abyssal Melody destroyed

==Description==
I know not what horrors await us ahead, but the Abyssal Melody must never follow its sister into the [[Shrine of the Storm]].

We will deny these monsters all that they have wrought here by burning it with the very magic they seek to corrupt.

The ritual is ready, but requires a conduit to stabilize. If you are willing, your Azerite-infused armor will suffice.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Lightning Tether]]
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]
*[[Copper Tidesage's Sconce]]

==Progress==
Whenever you are ready.

==Completion==
A pivotal step, but our work is far from finished.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Step into the storm so we may finish this.}}
:''Pike spawns a lightning area of effect on the ground just in front of him.''

Step in it and players will gain an extra action button:
*{{Abilities|Thundering Blast|Channel the storm's fury through you to incinerate the Abyssal Melody.|notes=13 sec cast|id=265497|icon=spell_nature_lightningoverload}}

Use it:
:{{text|yell|Brother Pike|Great storms upon the sea, heed my call!}}
:{{text|yell|Brother Pike|Smite this wretched vessel and free our people!}}
:''Lightning strikes and the ship catches fire, engulfing the deck and the lower half of the masts!''

This concludes the "The Growing Tempest" chapter of the [[Stormsong Valley storyline]]. The chain continues with [[A House Divided]].

==Progression==
{{From the Depths They Come}}
