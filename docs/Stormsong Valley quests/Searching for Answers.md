==Objectives==
Question Sister Adrianna, Brother Darrel, and Sister Cecilia for information about the missing fleet.
* [[Sister Adrianna]] questioned {{co|68.5|74.2|Boralus}}
* [[Brother Darrel]] questioned {{co|60.4|85.3|Boralus}}
* [[Sister Celicia]] questioned {{co|66.2|85.0|Boralus}}

==Description==
There's a saying Cyrus always said when I was a kid: "The best face is a friendly one." It's really helped me get to know the visitors from all over the world that come through Boralus.

Let's ask some of the people in charge around here and see if they know anything about the fleet. Maybe it's just a matter of asking nicely!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|70|}}
* 8,250 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
No luck just yet, but I think we're making progress.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Taelia|You know, someone around here has to know something. You can't just lose a whole fleet!}}

Mount up and head up the hill. Taelia questions a guard:
:{{text|say|Taelia|You there, who's in charge here?}}
:{{text|say|[[Stormsong Guard]]|Hmph.}}

[[Sister Adrianna]] and [[Captain Cunningham]] are having a conversation:
:{{text|say|Sister Adrianna|We can ensure the safe passage of your vessel, for a price.}}

Speak with Adrianna:
:It is rude to interrupt, outsider.
:{{gossip|Can you tell me anything about the missing fleet?}}
:{{text|say|Sister Adrianna|You are nearly as insufferable as [[Brother Alen]].}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|So... we'll take that as a no, then?}}

Take a right, then head southeast to find [[Sister Celicia]] speaking to an audience of [[Tidesage Initiate]]s:
:{{text|say|Sister Celicia|Bare your souls to the tides. Their whispers provide truth!}}

Speak with her:
:You're no student. You'd best have a good reason for interrupting my lesson.
:{{gossip|Can you tell me anything about the missing fleet?}}
:{{text|say|Sister Celicia|Why don't you pester Alen, if you're here to waste your time?}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Be that way. We just might!}}

Finally, head southwest to find [[Brother Darrel]] leading a group of Boralus Tidesages in a ritual:
:{{text|say|Brother Darrel|Double your efforts, fools! Before we lose control!}}

Speak with him:
:<Darrel does not seem to acknowledge your presence.>
:{{gossip|Can you tell me anything about the missing fleet?}}
:{{text|say|Brother Darrel|Begone to the archives with that fool Alen! Lest I use you to stabilize the rift!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|I don't like the looks of this. Let's get out of here.}}
