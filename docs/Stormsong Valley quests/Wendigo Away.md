==Objectives==
Kill Bonerender.
* [[Bonerender]] slain {{co|65.9|79.0|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
If the unearthly howls coming from the Highlands at night are any indication, the [[wendigo]]s must have some sort of leader or alpha.

I tell you, it's the sort of sound that could only come from some sort of massive, hulking, flesh-eating abomination.

Definitely something that could tear us limb from limb, and munch on our frail bones, all without breaking a sweat. How exhilarating!

I'm sure it'll be no problem for us to handle though.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Ahh, I always wanted to fight a giant wendigo!

==Completion==
Marvelous! Slaying their leader ought to put some fear into 'em.

==Notes and trivia==
Pick up all of [[Free the Farmhands]], [[Fetching Wrex]], [[The Bee Team]] and [[Wendigo Away]] before heading out.

The wendigo's in the back of a cave.
