==Objectives==
Lay Farmer Goldfield's family to rest.
* [[River Carnations]] {{co|51.6|75.2|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
I can take care of the rest. That [[ettin]] would have given me trouble if I was by myself, so you have my thanks.

I would ask you for one more favor.

My wife, she loved the carnations that grow by the water's edge. If you could gather some, there's a nice spot under a tree by the river. We loved to go there when the sun set after our days in the fields.

Our boy would run around, catching bugs, making reed whistles...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|70|}}
*[[Small Azerite Shard]] (100x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
That's that, then.

==Completion==
Thank you, <class>. They will rest now.

==Notes==
Head southeast to the river to find the [[River Carnations]], then head just upstream, where [[Farmer Goldfield]] has laid his wife and son to rest.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Farmer Goldfield|Aye, that will do. They always loved this spot...}}
:{{text|say|Farmer Goldfield|You can go back an' tell Roz that I'm okay, but I'm never leaving my farm. I'll never leave them.}}
