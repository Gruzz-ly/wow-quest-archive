==Objectives==
Destroy the [[Brambleguard Totem]]s in [[Briarback Kraul]].
* Northern totem destroyed {{co|44.0|72.4|Stormsong Valley}}
* Eastern totem destroyed {{co|47.0|70.2|Stormsong Valley}}
* Central totem destroyed {{co|46.4|72.1|Stormsong Valley}}
* Southern totem destroyed {{co|46.1|74.5|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
<This totem pulses with energy, releasing it into the nearby idols and thorns.

It looks rather fragile... It would be a shame if something happened to it.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Enjoying the kraul? Seeing the sights? Avoiding the brambles?

==Completion==
Good idea! Smashing those will distract their mystics and set back their expansion.

==Notes==
While in the [[Briarback Kraul]] for [[Look Out!]] and [[Boaring Company]], find one of the [[Brambleguard Totem]]s, which starts this quest.

The other three totems (make sure to destroy the quest-starter!) are marked on the map.

==Progression==
