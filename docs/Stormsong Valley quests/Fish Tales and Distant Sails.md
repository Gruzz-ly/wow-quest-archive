==Objectives==
Ask for information about the shipwright in [[Brennadam]].
* Learn [[Dorian Atwater|Dorian]]'s location

==Description==
I have an idea where to start, but it couldn't hurt to ask the locals. 

I hope it goes without saying that you shouldn't believe everything you hear, <name>. [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|My people]] are very fond of embellishing the truth.

I will meet you in [[Golden Flagon|The Golden Flagon]] when you've had a chance to ask around.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<He studies a map of [[Stormsong Valley]].>

What's the word, <name>?

==Notes==
On accepting this quest:
:{{text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Ask around. I'll speak with the innkeeper. Old [["Nasty" Buck|Buck]] never forgets a face.}}
:''Cyrus walks toward the [[Golden Flagon]].

Speak to 8 [[Talkative Brennadam Citizen]]s:
:{{gossip|Do you know where I can find Dorian Atwater?}}
Each citizen will respond with one of the following lines, in order:
:{{text|say|Talkative Brennadam Citizen|Who?}}
:{{text|say|Talkative Brennadam Citizen|Never seen it myself, but I've heard that Atwater once built a ship in a single day! Say hello for me, aye?}}
:{{text|say|Talkative Brennadam Citizen|Isn't that the name of a famous shipwright? I swear I've heard it before...}}
:{{text|say|Talkative Brennadam Citizen|Oh, sure. Atwater brings down a cart from up north every couple of days or so.}}
:{{text|say|Talkative Brennadam Citizen|THE Dorian Atwater? Famous shipwright? Designed the [[Proudmoore flagship|Kul Tiran flagship]]? Tall, strong, could build a boat without breaking a sweat? Nope, no idea who that is.}}
:{{text|say|Talkative Brennadam Citizen|Dorian? Oh, aye. I make the trek from [[Fort Daelin]] all the time and we sometimes cross paths. I hope that helps.}}
:{{text|say|Talkative Brennadam Citizen|The shipwright? I heard the old sea dog died.}}
:{{text|say|Talkative Brennadam Citizen|Aye, the Atwaters live out of town, somewhere in the [[Deadwash]] I reckon. I don't travel that way too often.}}
