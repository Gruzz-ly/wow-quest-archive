There is a terror beneath the waves. It seeks to destroy my family, my house, and my legacy.

You must come, claim your destiny and deliver us from the terrors of the deep!

Find our estate to the east, among the isles. We lived opulently in the shadow of the great fortress. We believed the priests would deliver us from the darkness below. Now that darkness has bubbled to the surface, whispering madness in our dreams.

Hurry. The air turns the darkest I have seen in my cursed existence.
