==Objectives==
Find [[Kelsey Steelspark]] in [[Stormsong Valley]].

==Description==
[[Mathias Shaw|Master Shaw]] deployed a number of [[Alliance]] [[Spy|spies]] near a base the [[Horde]] have made in Stormsong Valley. When our spies stopped checking in, he took Kelsey Steelspark and went to investigate.

Now Master Shaw is the one who hasn't checked in.

I need someone to go in and find our missing people and give them whatever help they clearly need.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We knew someone would come when we missed our check-in. With you as our backup the Horde isn't gonna stand a chance.

Shaw's further in the Valley trying to figure out what is going on in [[Warfang Hold]]. I've been trying to control the chaos here. Care to lend a hand?

==Progression==
