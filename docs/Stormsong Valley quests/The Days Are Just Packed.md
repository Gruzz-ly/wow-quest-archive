==Objectives==
Find [[Sergeant Calvin]] in [[Brennadam Square]].

==Description==
Hello there! Would you mind checking on someone for me?

Sergeant Calvin was supposed to meet me here. We were going to go out looking for new alchemical reagents, but he hasn't shown up yet.

I know the militia has been really busy lately so I guess he's busy, but he should still be in Brennadam Square. Would you mind checking in on him?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
This can't be happening...

==Notes==
;On approach
A cutscene plays.
:''Brennadam is having another idle day. Townsfolk are at their trades, others are resting, and a young child brushes past the adventurer. Turning to look at the child, the child stops and points in horror as he sees what approaches. Dozens upon dozens of Bombarding Zeppelins approach from the distance and start firebombing Brennadam Square. From another front, orc riders on dire wolves start bearing down on the town.''

On the other side of the cutscene, [[Sergeant Calvin]] and [[Mayor Roz]] offer some quests, and a bonus objective is available in the form of [[The Battle for Brennadam]].
