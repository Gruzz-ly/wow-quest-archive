==Objectives==
Destroy 8 Anchors of Binding.
* [[Anchor of Binding]] destroyed (8)

==Description==
We had our orders: ships, and lots of 'em. I led my boys as best I could.

Everything changed when the [[tidesages]] showed up. We figured they was just checkin' on our progress, but the hood-wearin' bastards turned on us!

These anchors bind us here, forcin' us to work to death. No one deserves a fate like that. You gotta free my boys!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
I owe you one, stranger!
