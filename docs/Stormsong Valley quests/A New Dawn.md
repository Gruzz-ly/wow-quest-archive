==Objectives==
Meet [[Taelia]] in the [[Harbormaster's Office]] in [[Boralus]].

==Description==
[[House Stormsong]] may be lost, but this valley still holds so much hope. 

[[Samuel Williams|Sam]] knew that from the beginning.

We have to continue to help the [[Storm's Wake]] in any way we can. There are still remnants of the fallen house everywhere, and whoever turned them to this darkness is out there as well.

Cyrus and the others will want to hear about everything that happened. We should tell them together.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
I've filled them in on most of the details already. The Storm's Wake will be an invaluable ally if we're to reunite Kul Tiras.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Taelia silently hops on [[Galeheart]] and flies back to Boralus.''

This is a breadcrumb back to [[Boralus]] at the end of the "At the House of Madness" chapter of the [[Stormsong Valley storyline]]. Pike also offers a breadcrumb to the dungeon in the form of [[Shrine of the Storm: Whispers Below]].

There's no direct follow-up to this quest. Consider working on side quests in [[Stormsong Valley]] (as four more chapters are needed to earn [[Stormsong and Dance]]) or pick up one of the other zones' storylines from the [[Scouting Map]] in the office.

If you've earned Stormsong and Dance here as the last step of [[Loremaster of Kul Tiras]], Cyrus will have [[What You May Regret]] for you.

==Progression==
