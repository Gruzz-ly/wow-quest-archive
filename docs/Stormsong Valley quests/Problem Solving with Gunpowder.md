==Objectives==
Set 5 Explosive Traps.
* [[Live Explosive Trap|Explosive Traps]] armed (5)

==Description==
Fort walls only go so far when it comes to defense. We've got [[cannon]]s in position to fire if the [[naga]] get too close, but we need some fortifications further out.

There should be a few good areas to set up some traps further down the beach. Those naga will never know what hit them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Never underestimate [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] weaponry!

==Completion==
If you run across any other opportune spots, feel free to set up more mines.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Any Ammo Will Do]] and [[Piercing the Shield]] before heading out. Exit to the west.

Harpoons are stuck in walls and found in the corpses of [[Shoalbreach Lance]]s. Live Explosive Traps can be set all over the quest area. Kill [[Zeth'jir Seacaller]]s until the channeling rod drops.

==Progression==
{{From the Depths}}
