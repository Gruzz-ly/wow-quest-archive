==Objectives==
Destroy 3 [[SI:7]] Listening Devices near [[Warfang Hold]].
* [[SI:7 Listening Device]] destroyed (3)

==Description==
It looks like the stealth generators aren't the only tech that SI:7 is bringing into the field. Our [[scout]]s have reported what look like listening devices set up at key points around Warfang.

Obviously, these things have to go, but the goons haven't been able to get close to them on account of the hidden [[Spy|spies]].

While you're out there, make sure to trash 'em.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Make sure to scrap those listening devices up real good.

==Completion==
Looks like I owe you another one, pal.

I'll have Kazit add it to the books.

==Notes==
After destroying SI:7 Listening Device, [[SI:7 Technician]]s attack.
