==Objectives==
Slay 15 of the naga forces invading [[Fort Daelin]].
* Northern [[Naga]] forces slain (15)

==Description==
While we try to figure out what to do with those channelers, we'll have to take shots where we can get them.

Our men could use some assistance retaking parts of the lower walls. Kill some naga for me, would you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
How's the snake hunting going?

==Completion==
Each one you killed is one less my men have to worry about. Thanks.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Eeling in a Big One]], [[Filching from Thieves]] and [[Reclaiming our Defenses]] before heading out.

Head north and start killing [[Zeth'jir Enthraller]]s, [[Zeth'jir Tideguard]]s, [[Zeth'jir Undertow]]s, [[Zeth'jir Tidemaiden]]s, and [[Zeth'jir Tidelord]]s. The rare sea giant [[Seabreaker Skoloth]] is also in the area.
