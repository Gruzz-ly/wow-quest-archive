==Objectives==
Collect 10 Sea Mines
*Steal [[Venture Co. Sea Mine|Sea Mines]] (10)
*[[Rope and Hook]] (provided)

==Description==
During a visit to [[Pandaria]], I witnessed the citizens of [[Halfhill]] defeat attacking [[hozen]] by flinging the hozen's excrement back at them. 

The hozen were unprepared to face the wrath of their own weaponry used against them. A similar strategy can be applied here. We will gather Venture Co. Sea Mines and use them against the invaders. 

You hook ropes to each mine, and [[Ai'twen]] and I will haul them up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]
*+75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. Our plan is coming together nicely.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Deep Sea Venture]] and [[Breaker Bad]] before heading out.

:{{text|say|Toki|These mines weren't built to detect turtles! We can gather them safely.}}
:{{text|say|Toki|Between Ai'twen's strong back, my brilliant strategy, and your dauntless determination, we're undefeatable.}}
:{{text|say|Toki|Perfection, <name>! We have more than enough mines to strike against the Venture Company.}}

==Progression==
