==Objectives==
Kill 12 Highland Maulers.
* [[Highlands Mauler]] slain (12)
*[[Bee Pheromones]] (provided)

==Description==
We need to put things in order, and the next item on the list is these blasted [[wendigo]]s terrorizing the farm. 

If we can cull their numbers, it should be enough to drive them off!

I've synthesized a superb solution that might be just what we need to solvent this sticky situation!

Toss these bottles at your foes and our friendly little apoideas should come to help.

Whatever you do, please don't spill any on yourself...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Why did it have to be wendigos...?

==Completion==
Hah! Did you see the look of sheer terror on their faces when they saw the bee swarms? 

Marvelous!

==Notes==
Pick up all of [[Free the Farmhands]], [[Fetching Wrex]] and [[Wendigo Away]] before heading out.

Use the quest item on the wendigos for some bonus damage.
