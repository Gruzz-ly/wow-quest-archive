==Objectives==
Kill 10 Irontide Pirates.
* [[Irontide Raiders|Irontide]] [[Pirate]]s slain (10)

==Description==
A few years ago I tried to join the Irontide. They said I wasn't "Irontide material", not cruel or heartless enough! 

So I teamed up with [[Nedly Grinner|Nedly]] and [[Moxie Lockspinner|Moxie]] here in [[Deadwash]], and we started looking for treasure on our own. 

Let's show these Irontide they're not "Deadwash material".

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Show the Irontide they aren't tough enough to hang around here!

==Completion==
No one's gonna cry about a few less pirates. I may even dance about it!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Break 'Em Out]] and [[Two-Faced Pirate Scum]] before heading out.

Pirates are all over. The ettin is just to the northwest of town, and the townsfolk are in the lowlands off to the east and south.

Kill targets include: [[Irontide Keelhauler]]s, [[Irontide Coin Hauler]]s, [[Irontide Slaver]]s, [[Irontide Trickshot]]s, [[Irontide Cutthroat (Stormsong Valley)|Irontide Cutthroats]], and [[Irontide Pillager]]s.

==Progression==
{{Treasure in Deadwash}}
