==Objectives==
Collect 60 Royal Jelly.
* [[Royal Jelly (quest item)]] (60)

==Description==
The scientific breakthroughs I've made, marvelous, absolutely marvelous... I'm so close to perfecting the formula!

The way the honey grows and crystallizes, simply beautiful. Well, as you can see, that's also part of my current predicament.

Perhaps you can lend me a hand? Just fetch some royal jelly from the hives outside.

Oh, don't worry about the [[bee]]s, they are sweet, gentle things. 

They don't sting... much.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
You get all the jelly yet?

==Completion==
Hope you didn't have any problems with bees. No, of course not... why would you? 

They're totally harmless.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Royal Succession]] before heading out.

Loot [[Bee Hive]]s for 5-9 jelly, but be warned that nearby [[Royal Guard (Stormsong Valley)|Royal Guards]] will aggro. Guards themselves drop 1. The [[Hive Mother]] is in the cave just to the south.
