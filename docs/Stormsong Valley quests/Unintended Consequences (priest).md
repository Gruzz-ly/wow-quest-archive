==Objectives==
Find the Void Stone in [[Drustvar]].
* Void Stone found
* Stop the ritual
* Void Stone taken
* [[Void Stone (quest item)]] activated

==Description==
<[[Xal'atath]] speaks once more.>

The servants of [[N'Zoth]] prepare for their master's return. They intend to conjure a scouring storm to wash away all unbelievers.

The particular ritual they will invoke requires three ancient artifacts. One of void, one of storm, and one of ocean.

Even now, I hear the void relic calling to me. It is being empowered... or corrupted, I am not sure which. I see it upon a cliff, overlooking a vast sea.

Come, <class>. We can find a much better use for such a prize.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*[[Glowing Azerite Crystal]] (250 [[Azerite (resource)]])

==Progress==
A change of pace can be invigorating, eh, High Priest?

==Completion==
Do not be distracted. We have more to do.

:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|How glorious it is to be renewed! Though I haven't forgotten your [[The Power in Our Hands|callous misuse]] of me in [[Silithus]]. Such a waste of potential.}}
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|It pleases me that we have a chance to spend more time together. You should know that of my many companions, you were my favorite.}}

:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|There! Those novices are performing some sort of ritual on the stone.}}
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|Stop them and take what is ours.}}

;Stop ritual
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|Does she actually think she can break open the stone? Fool. Were we not pressed for time, I would enjoy watching her fall.}}

:{{Text|say|Inanis|At last... I know... my purpose...}}
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|Unleash the Void Stone, <name>. It should provide the strength I need to help you find the other two relics.}}
