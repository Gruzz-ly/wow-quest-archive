==Objectives==
Collect 20 Salvaged [[:Azerite]] Ammunition.
* [[Salvaged Azerite Ammunition]] (20)
* [[Goldfield's Knife]] (provided)

==Description==
You see the problem? No you don't.

Problem isn't all these dang [[quilboar]]. Quilboar I can shoot all day. Been shootin' em all my life, since my pappy gave me my first gun. 

Problem is these pigs are tough. Tougher'n they've been before. Can't kill em like I used to, see? My new modified bullets just get stuck in them and they refuse to die!

Here, take my knife. Go out there and kill some of the quilboar and get my ammo back. Then I can shoot the rest! I won't stop 'till there's none left to shoot!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Pretty sure I'll have to start shootin' my dinnerware, and I only have three sets. Hurry up, will you?

==Completion==
Good! I can keep shooting, and they can't get to me! This is really the perfect setup.

==Notes==
After picking up the quest, jump down and run southwest to the shed to find a [[Dirty Pocketwatch]] on the ground. It starts [[A Reason to Stay]]. Make sure to pick up the other keepsakes while killing and looting [[Hungry Rooter]]s and [[Briarback Boarmaster]]s.

==Progression==
{{Briarback Kraul}}
