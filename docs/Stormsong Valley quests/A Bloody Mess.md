==Objectives==
Collect 20 Tideblood.
* [[Tideblood]] (20)

==Description==
;1

<The vial is filled with a viscous, bubbling substance. It bears a striking resemblance to the animated horrors around you.

It struggles against the container, as if trying to escape. [[Brother Pike|Pike]] would surely be interested in more samples.>

;2

[[Tidesages|My order]] blesses every [[Kul Tiran]] ship within the halls of the [[Shrine of the Storm]]. Our blessings make our ships the strongest in all of [[Azeroth]]; the [[fleet]] of legend.

The ritual requires a substance known as tideblood. It is a viscous, powerful substance dredged from the depths of the sea and infused into the very hull of each ship.

Something has caused the tideblood here to become animate. Studying it may help us better understand our enemy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
;1
What is that you have there?

;2
The more tideblood you can bring me, the better.

==Completion==
;1
This tideblood is saturated with dark [[magic]]. Thank you for bringing it to me.

;2
Thank you. This will help us indeed.

==Notes==
While in [[Port Fogtide]] for [[Beneath the Veil]] and [[No Quarter]], any of the mobs in the area will drop the [[Frothing Vial]], which starts this quest.

At the north end of the quest area, watch out for [[Dagrus the Scorned]], a rare giant.

Kill the oozes of [[Frothing Tideblood]] and look for barrels of [[Sealed Tideblood]] as well.

On complete:

:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Ah! It is more volatile than I thought.}}
