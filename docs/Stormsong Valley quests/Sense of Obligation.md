Head to [[Seabreeze Village]] in [[Stormsong Valley]]. I hope there you will be able to find out... well, let's just say I am trying to keep the bigger picture in focus.

For now, let's keep this between the two of us.

I must act quickly.

;Eavesdropping
:{{Text|say|[[Calia Menethil]]|Ah, Jaina. What a relief to see you safe.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Hello, Calia. Big brother.}}
:{{Text|say|Derek Proudmoore|Word has spread of [[Battle at the Gates of Orgrimmar|what happened]] at [[Orgrimmar]]. Is the [[Fourth War|war]] finally over?}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|It will take time for all the pockets of fighting to be quelled, but... yes, I believe so.}}
:{{Text|say|Calia Menethil|Azeroth has seen so many wars, so much strife. I pray we have earned a respite.}}
:''Derek walks towards Calia, and they briefly hold hands.''
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|As do I. Have you been able to find peace in your own heart, Derek?}}
:{{Text|say|Derek Proudmoore|I still have some rough seas to sail, but I'm much better now, thanks to Calia. Without her guidance, I would have been truly lost.}}
:{{Text|say|Calia Menethil|I'm so grateful you brought us together, Jaina. This time with Derek has helped me as much as it's helped him.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|In the wake of this war, [[Forsaken|others]] will need to find their footing. Their future. Perhaps you could guide them, too.}}
:{{Text|say|Calia Menethil|I'm not sure how much help I could be. I don't have all the answers.}}
:{{Text|say|Derek Proudmoore|Maybe they don't need answers. Maybe they just need hope. Like I did.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Well said, big brother. Come, let's take a walk. I am so grateful to have you both back in my life.}}
:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Let's enjoy this moment together.}}
