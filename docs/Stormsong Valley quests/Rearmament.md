==Objectives==
Collect 12 Stormfused Weapons.
* [[Stormfused Weapon]] (12)

==Description==
The people of this valley have true hearts, <name>. They're eager to take back control of their home.

We have to help them.

The Brineworks up the road from here supplies most of House Stormsong's weapons. Our movement here could make great use of them.

If you can collect enough to go around, I'll go over some basic training with our friends here.

==Rewards==

|Thundershot Rifle

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
There are still many who don't follow Lord Stormsong. We need to stand by them.

==Completion==
This valley belongs to its people. We must fight to make it whole again!

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Taelia blows her whistle.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|Listen up! We need you to get ready to fight, and quick.}}

Pick up [[Fabricated Fabrications]] before heading out.

On the way into the [[Brineworks]], find the corpse of [[Chief Architect Wilson]] on the road. He's holding a [[Charred Note]] which starts [[The Missing Link]].

Inside town, loot a dozen Stormfused Weapons, kill [[Shipwright Turncoat]]s, [[Brinebrawn Cannoneer]]s, and [[Stormfused Strikesmith]]s for a [[Warship Blueprint]] or eight, and find and defeat [[Tideguard Pontus]] for the [[Architect's Cipher]].

Watch out for the rare ''elite'' [[Reinforced Hullbreaker]] patrolling town. It is fixed at level 122 with 1.6 million health. However, there is a standard rare elemental on top of the hill just outside of town, [[Galestorm]]. There's also a corrupted pod of dolphins in the river just north of town, comprised of a [[Corrupted Tideskipper]] and three [[Juvenile Tideskipper]]s.
