==Objectives==
Retrieve the [[Hive Mother|Hive Mother's]] Stinger.
* [[Hive Mother's Stinger]] {{co|74.8|71.5|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
I know, I know, okay... the farm is overrun by living honey and the bees have grown to massive proportions.

I'll admit, things didn't quite go according to plan, but, extraordinary advancements in science do not come without some risk!

I've been up here attempting to reduce aggression in the hive, an unfortunate side effect of my miscalculation, but I need another favor...

You're going to have to kill the Hive Mother and retrieve her stinger for me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* [[Small Azerite Fragment]] (50x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Oooh, ooh, do you have it!?

==Completion==
I'm glad you still have both of your eyes!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sticky Situation (Stormsong Valley)]] before heading out.

Loot [[Bee Hive]]s for 5-9 jelly, but be warned that nearby [[Royal Guard (Stormsong Valley)|Royal Guards]] will aggro. Guards themselves drop 1. The [[Hive Mother]] is in the cave just to the south.
