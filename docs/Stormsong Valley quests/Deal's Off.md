==Objectives==
Search the [[Deal Farmstead]] for any survivors.

==Description==
There's one more farm left, far to the west. They're real close to the kraul.

Deal works the land by herself. If anyone got hit bad, it'd be her. It's just past the worst part of the collapse, so keep an eye out for the [[quilboar]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
I'm glad to know the others are safe. But not for long if we don't do something about these quilboar!

==Notes==
If not already done, consider doing the side quests in town, [[Follow Your Nose]], [[Sic 'Em!]], and the quests at the [[Burton Farmstead]] starting with [[Gadgets and Gizmos Aplenty]] & [[Stop Vining!]] while on the way to the [[Deal Farmstead]].

Also on the way is a [[Wanted Poster]], offering [[WANTED: Thundersnout (Alliance)]].

==Progression==
