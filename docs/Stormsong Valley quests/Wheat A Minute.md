==Objectives==
Collect 10 Grain Sacks.
* [[Grain Sack]] (10)

==Description==
With the storage shed ransacked by rats and the giants pillaging our shipments, we've been running low on food.

When I was making my way out here, I saw a bunch of grain sacks littered about, near the wrecked wagons.

I'd appreciate it if you could retrieve whatever you find while you're out here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Were you able to recover some of the grain?

==Completion==
Wow! I can't believe you were able to carry all of that.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Mighty Grokkfist]] before heading out.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Charles Davenport|I'm getting out of here as soon as it's clear. I'll see you back at Grandma's house, good luck!}}
