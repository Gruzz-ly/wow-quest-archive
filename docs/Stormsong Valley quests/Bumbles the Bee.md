==Objectives==
Locate Raimond's Secret Ingredient.

* [[Raimond's Secret Ingredient]]

==Description==
Hey <name>, thanks for delivering [[Rosaline's Letter|Mom's letter]]. I was really starting to worry about her!

[[Raimond Mildenhall|Dad]] and I have been having a few problems running [[Mildenhall Meadery|the farm]] after she left on her trip. If you didn't show up when you did, we'd still be in real trouble!

I was hoping you would be willing to help [[Bumbles]] out too. He was hurt when his hive was destoyed.

If we feed him some of Dad's special formula, hopefully he will heal up faster. First we need to find the secret ingredient, try looking around at his other lab.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find it? I think it's in a purple bottle.

==Completion==
Alright! This is exactly what we needed.
