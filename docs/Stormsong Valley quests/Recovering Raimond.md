==Objectives==
Find [[Raimond Mildenhall]].
* [[Sticky Boot]] (Provided) (2) {{co|71.6|68.0|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Journal Pages]] (3)

==Description==
The map we found earlier had some red markings, near the flower field. 

Do you think you could go up there and look for dad?

I'm going to stay here and check out the rest of this stuff. 

I'd go with you... but, I'm sort of allergic to bees.

Oh, and take his boot. Just in case!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
It is about time someone came looking for me!

==Completion==
Ahh, hah! [[Ancel Mildenhall|Ancel]] sent you to find me, huh?

Hey, you found my boots too!? Marvelous!

==Notes==
Head back outside, then follow the road east to [[Rosaline's Apiary]].

Right in the middle of the road is the other [[Honey Soaked Boot]]. Keep following the road to find [[Discarded Pages]] (of [[Journal Pages]]).

First at {{co|72.4|68.6|Stormsong Valley}}:
:{{text|say|Raimond Mildenhall|Entry One: The honey has come to life, but is replicating at a rate beyond my wildest dreams. I must run more tests!}}

Second at {{co|72.3|70.6|Stormsong Valley}}:
:{{text|say|Raimond Mildenhall|Entry Two: The animated mead has begun to exhibit signs of aggression. Perhaps I've made a slight miscalculation.}}

Third at {{co|73.4|72.3|Stormsong Valley}}:
:{{text|say|Raimond Mildenhall|Entry Three: I've nearly done it! The bees are growing and productivity is increasing exponentially. I must keep a closer eye on the queen, however.}}

Enter the cave just to the east to find Raimond.
