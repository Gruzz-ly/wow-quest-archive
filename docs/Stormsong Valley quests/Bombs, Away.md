==Objectives==
Retrieve 8 [[Horde]] [[Explosive]]s and use them against the Demolishers.
* [[Horde Explosive]] (8)
* [[Demolisher (Stormsong Valley)|Demolishers]] destroyed (2)

==Description==
By the sea's foamy beard, what a blast!

They've brought goblins, and if there's one thing I know about goblins it's that they like to blow things up.

I saw a few of them carrying large bombs, and I presume that they are going to blow up the town. I would like to keep the town, so how about you head out there and steal as many of those explosives as you can find? After that, let's blow up their demolishers and stop this infernal bombardment!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Don't forget to check inside the buildings too!

==Completion==
These look particularly nasty. I'm glad they aren't blowing up in our faces.

==Notes==
Pick up [[You Have Their Orders]] and [[Dousing the Flames]] before heading out. While in the area the Bonus objective [[The Battle for Brennadam]] is also available.

Sapper Charges occasionally drop from the sky. Interact with one before it explodes to acquire some [[Horde Explosive]]s. More unexploded Explosives are near buildings. Grab eight, then head to the north side of town to find two Demolishers (at {{co|55.6|60.6|Stormsong Valley}} at {{co|54.6|60.9|Stormsong Valley}}) near [[Champion Lockjaw]].

==Progression==
{{Brennadam}}
