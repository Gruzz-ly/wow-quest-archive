On accept:

The camera shifts to an overhead view, showing Loh in the lower-left corner of a 4x4 area. Players have access to three abilities, Turn Left, Move Forward, and Turn Right, which act as expected.

For the first challenge, move forward until Loh is at the center of the area, dodging the obstacles on the way.

==Trivia==
*This quest is likely a reference to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language) Logo programming language], which was designed to teach children programming concepts. Its most famous application is commanding a turtle to move around and draw onscreen, which Loh himself does with his water trails.
