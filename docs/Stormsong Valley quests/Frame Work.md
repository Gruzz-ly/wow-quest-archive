==Objectives==
Meet [[Dorian Atwater]] at the [[Algerson Lumber Yard]] in [[Tiragarde Sound]].

==Description==
Now that I have a slip to work in, I'm going to need [[lumber]].

Lots of lumber.

The only [[lumber mill]] that could handle this kind of volume at such short notice would be the Algerson Lumber Yard outside of [[Boralus]].

I know this because I've made this exact request of them before.

I will meet you there. [[Maynard Algerson|Algerson]] might need a little persuasion.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I overestimated Algerson's usefulness here, but don't worry. I have a plan.

==Notes==
On accepting this quest:
:''Dorian Atwater points across the bridge toward the slip.''
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|All right, boys. Go on and set us up.}}
:''As her two [[Bound Earth]] helpers dutifully rumble away, Dorian mounts up on [[Hurricane (horse)|Hurricane]] and heads south.''

At the [[Algerson Lumber Yard]]:
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|You're making this harder than it needs to be, [[Maynard Algerson|Maynard]].}}
: ''Inside the office, Dorian is facing Maynard Algerson at his desk, but turns to speak to the [[Algerson Lumberjack]]s in the room.''
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Lads, there's a pile of gold and a pint of ale in it for everyone who lends me a hand.}}
