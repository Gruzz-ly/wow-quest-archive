==Objectives==
Find and rescue Millie.
* [[Millie]] rescued {{co|26.6|75.3|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
I'll admit, Millie has never really been one to follow the herd. Usually, it's no problem. She'll wander off for a bit, do her own thing and eventually make her way back to the flock.

The hills have grown increasingly more dangerous lately, especially with the [[Wolf|wolves]] and giants about. She's been gone awhile and I'm starting to worry.

Could you please help me look for her?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Have you found her?

==Completion==
Oh, my sweet Millie! Thank you, <name>. I'm in your debt.

==Progression==
