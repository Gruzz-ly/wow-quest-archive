==Objectives==
Use the Abyssal Beacon to dispel the [[Writhing Grasp]]s.
* Southern Grasp dispelled {{co|67.5|44.3|Stormsong Valley}}
* Western Grasp dispelled {{co|66.0|41.8|Stormsong Valley}}
* Eastern Grasp dispelled {{co|67.7|42.4|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Abyssal Beacon (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
We must board the [[Abyssal Melody]] and save the myriad souls in her decks before they too disappear into the [[Shrine of the Storm|Shrine]]. We will not be able to enter so long as the barrier surrounding it stands.

The [[tidesages]] are using forbidden magic to summon extensions of their will. It is these grasps that maintain the barrier.

Take my beacon and mark each grasp. I will rain vengeance down upon them from here.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Abyssal Beacon
|Tideguard Bulwark
|Purified Tideblood Band
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Have the grasps been dealt with?

==Completion==
The ''Abyssal Melody'' lies unprotected. Now is our chance.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Tidesages have long guided lost souls at sea... but not like this.}}

Pick up [[No Quarter]] from [[Taelia]] before heading out.

While killing mobs in the area, one of them will drop the [[Frothing Vial]], which starts [[A Bloody Mess]].

At the north end of the quest area, watch out for [[Dagrus the Scorned]], a rare giant.

Use the quest item and target the ground near the writhing grasp:
*{{text|say|Brother Pike|Tides consume your wicked flesh.}}
*{{text|say|Brother Pike|Your grasp will protect this vessel no longer.}}
*{{text|say|Brother Pike|Begone, wretched darkness.}}

==Progression==
{{From the Depths They Come}}

==Patch changes==
