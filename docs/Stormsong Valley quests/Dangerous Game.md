==Objectives==
Rid the hills of these [[Forsaken]] Keenblades.
* [[Forsaken Keenblade]] slain (8)

==Description==
Most of these [[Horde]] don't scare us, but we lost two people today to a group of forsaken keenblades. We've had trouble tracking them down, we could really use your help.

They're stealthy and dangerous fighters, so show no mercy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
We need your help getting rid of these keenblades.

==Completion==
Your skills are impressive.  I don't think any of us could have taken out those keenblades so easily.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Smells Like Trouble]] and [[Never Outgunned]] before heading out. Optionally, the wanted poster offers [[WANTED: Yarsel'ghun]] as well.

While killing [[Forsaken Keenblade]]s in the [[Windshorn Hills]], look almost due east of the [[Eckhart Lodge]] to find a Cannon at {{co|60.2|54.6|Stormsong Valley}}. It starts [[Bring out the Big Gun]].

Keep an eye out for [[Taja the Tidehowler]], a rare at {{co|60.0|45.8|Stormsong Valley}} high in the hills.

==Progression==
{{Eckhart Lodge}}
