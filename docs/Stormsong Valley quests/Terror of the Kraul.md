==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Bramblefist the Maddened.jpg|Bramblefist the Maddened|Stop him before it's too late!}}
Defeat Bramblefist the Maddened.
* [[Bramblefist the Maddened]] slain
* [[Flask of Enraging Vapors]] (provided)

==Description==
By all the gods of the sea, what a monster!

I can barely believe what I am seeing, <name>. This [[ettin]] has undergone the same ritual that the brutes do, and it seems even angrier! If he gets out of here, we won't stand a chance.

I know I ask the impossible, but I must: kill this monstrosity and save the whole [[Stormsong Valley|valley]] from its wrath! Here, take one of the potion samples you brought me. It's probably dangerous, but you might need it to defeat this beast.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Needleshot Repeater
|Kraulguard Poleaxe
|Briarback Thornspike
|Brennadam Vinescythe

|Thornmatron's Vinecaller
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
We have to kill that thing!

==Completion==
It's done! I was afraid you were done for, but you've saved us all!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sergeant Calvin|I just want to wish you good luck. We're all counting on you.}}

Follow the path shown in the cutscene through [[Thornheart]] to reach the ettin. The area is in a different phase from normal, so there should be no other quilboar in the area.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Sergeant Calvin|You actually did it! Quickly, over here!}}

==Progression==
{{Briarback Kraul}}

==Trivia==
Sergeant Calvin's well wishes is a direct quote from Leslie Nielsen's character, Dr. Rumack,  in the movie Airplane! (1980).
