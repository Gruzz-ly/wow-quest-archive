==Objectives==
Slay 12 drowned forces in [[Port Fogtide]].
* Drowned forces slain  (12)

==Description==
I've spent my whole life on and around the sea.

Until very recently I feel like I've always had one foot in the water. I knew there were... things... best left untouched.

Now they're here. In [[Stormsong Valley]]. Occupying the slip I need to build your ship.

Do I really need to tell you what to do about it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I never thought I would see such things in the flesh. Have you dealt with them?

==Completion==
All this gives me the shivers, <name>.

==Notes==
*Enemies that count toward this quest include [[Drowned Convert]]s, [[Drowned Harbinger]]s, [[Umbral Hulk]]s, and [[Grasp of the Deep|Grasps of the Deep]].
