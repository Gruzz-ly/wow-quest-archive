==Objectives==
Report to [[Lieutenant Bauer]] at [[Seabreeze Village]].

==Description==
I was sent to [[Brennadam]] by my commanding officer to find a [[tidesage]] to help us at Fort Daelin to the west. The [[naga]] have started another attack on the bastion, and it's larger than any we have seen. 

Lieutenant Bauer is in the middle of helping out civilians at the village near the fort, and she could use any help possible.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
These fishermen are no pushovers themselves. They should be able to hold their own here with a little help.

==Progression==
{{From the Depths}}

==Patch changes==
