==Objectives==
Collect 10 Foul-Smelling Samples.
* [[Foul-Smelling Sample]] (10)

==Description==
'''1'''

<The bottle the [[quilboar]] was carrying contains a foul-smelling, orange liquid. You're not sure if it's safe to drink, but it can't hurt to gather some samples to bring back to the citizens of [[Brennadam]].

Maybe their alchemist can come up with an antidote to counter its effects.>

'''2'''

These quilboar are tougher than normal and I think I found out why.

They carry vials of some sort, filled with this nasty orange liquid. They'll quaff it and gain tremendous strength and stamina.

I'll bet if we get some of it Hobbs could whip up a counter-agent, or whatever it is that alchemists do. Either way, deprive them of their strength potions and it'll make getting around here easier!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Do you have something for me?

==Completion==
This stuff smells awful. Maybe [[Hobbs]] will know what to do with it. Once we get out of here I'll make sure these samples get to him.

==Notes==
While in the [[Briarback Kraul]] for [[Look Out!]] and [[Boaring Company]], any quilboar in the area will drop the [[Foul-Smelling Flask]], which starts this quest.

Keep killing quilboar until ten drop.

==Progression==
{{Briarback Kraul}}
