==Objectives==
Kill 15 [[naga]] forces in the [[Eventide Delta]].
* [[Zeth'jir]] Forces slain (15)

==Description==
The greatest of the Zeth'jir offensive sits within the delta as we speak, waiting for the summoning ritual to be finished. If we can clear out a number of them, we'll finally have the upper hand.

Get down there and cause as much chaos as you can!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
This for will always stand in defense of Kul Tiras!

==Completion==
Good work! That should deter the naga for now.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Snake with Three Heads]] before heading out. Exit to the southwest.

Kill [[Zeth'jir Seacaller]]s, [[Zeth'jir Tidelord]]s, [[Zeth'jir Enthraller]]s, and [[Zeth'jir Deepfighter]]s.

{{From the Depths}}
