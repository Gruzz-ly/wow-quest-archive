==Objectives==
Use the Electronic Mayhem Projector to reveal and kill 10 SI:7 spies in the [[Clearcut]].
* [[SI:7]] [[spy]] slain (10)
*[[Electronic Mayhem Projector]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Alliance]] must've got wind of this meeting and they've sent SI:7 spies to try to listen in.

The problem is, they're using some kind of [[Gnome|gnomish]] [[Technology|tech]] to sneak past our detectors. One of our [[Technician|techs]] was able to put together something that should be able to neutralize whatever they're using, but the range is short.

I'll need you to take it out into the field and look for evidence of SI:7 activity. Just mash the button on that thing when you think they're close, and it should zap 'em back into view.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you clear out the spies yet?

==Completion==
Looks like [[goblin]] tech wins again!

Seriously though, thanks for saving my hide.

==Notes==
*Kill [[SI:7 Operative (Stormsong Valley)|SI:7 Operatives]] and [[SI:7 Technician]]s near [[Alliance Field Pack]]s, [[Sabotaged Shredder]]s, or [[Dead Lumberjack]]s.
