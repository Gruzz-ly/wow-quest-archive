==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Alliance]] and [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] [[soldier]]s within [[Sagehold]].
* Alliance and Kul Tiran forces slain (10)

==Description==
We've been scouting the area of Sagehold for some time now. It was recently retaken by a large force of Alliance and Kul Tirans.

We have been waiting for an opportunity to strike when their defenses were weakened. Now is that time.

Go down to Sagehold and show the forces that remain what happens to those who take up arms against the [[Horde]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
Have you taken care of their forces?

==Completion==
Good. The area of Sagehold should be overrun again by the rebel tidesages once we are done.

==Notes==
*Kill [[7th Legion Soldier]]s, [[7th Legion Marksman|7th Legion Marksmen]] and [[Kul Tiran Marine]]s.

:{{Text|Say|Thomas Zelling|No, but can you answer my question? When you become [[Forsaken]], are you purged of any sicknesses?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lilian Voss|Becoming Forsaken is an unpredictable process. Your body and mind are certain to change, but to what extent... it's impossible to know. As is how well you will cope with the process.}}
:{{Text|Say|Thomas Zelling|Did [[Captain Amalia Stone|Captain Stone]] go mad when she turned? I'm well aware of what happened to her.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lilian Voss|We all go a little mad when we become Forsaken. Some more than others.}}
