==Objectives==
Collect 100 Gunpowder from [[Volatile Rat]]s.
* [[Gunpowder]] (100)

==Description==
[[Marie Davenport|Granny]] has everyone out running errands trying to put [[Millstone Hamlet|our hamlet]] back in order.

I don't know what to do. The [[rat]]s have gotten into our stores, they're eating everything in sight.

I tried prodding one of them to get it to move along, it started foaming at the mouth, then it exploded!

Think I know where all the gunpowder went...

If you recover any, can you please take it back to Marie?
