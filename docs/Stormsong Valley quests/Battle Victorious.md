Ai'twen swims back to [[Seekers' Vista]], where the tortollans give a hero's welcome:
:{{text|say|[[Norobi]]|We are humbled by your great deeds. Many thanks, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|[[Jinson]]|Our lengthy history has seen few days as great as this!}}
:{{text|say|[[Boxi]]|I'm going to grow up to be like you!}}
:{{text|say|[[Maokka]]|I am going to create a new soup in your honor!}}
:{{text|say|Boxi|You're a hero!}}
:{{text|say|[[Nort]]|Blow them up again!}}

On approach:
:{{text|say|Toki|A glorious battle! And we lived, <name>!}}
