==Objectives==
East and West Caves blown open!
* Eastern Cave [[Moxie's Bombs|Opened]] {{co|50.9|58.2|Stormsong Valley}}
* Western Cave Opened {{co|48.7|56.6|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
I stole an old treasure map off an [[Irontide Raiders|Irontide]] [[pirate]]. The map marks several caves on it with circles. 

The caves are blocked by boulders, but now that you're here, we're going to open them up.

You get to do all the dangerous stuff, plant explosives, kill things and cave exploring. I'll supervise.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
The sooner we check out the cavers, the sooner we could be rich.

==Completion==
Boom! Problem solved.

==Notes==
Pick up all of [[Anchors Aweigh Too Much]], [[Not On Our Payroll]] and [[Fun With Magnets]] before heading out.

While out and about, look for [[Crushtacean]] at {{co|51.2|55.4|Stormsong Valley}} in a cave off on the eastern side of the quest area. It drops the [[Bonesplinter Band]] and some [[Azerite (resource)]].

The western cave is guarded by [[First Mate Grogtok]].

:{{text|say|Moxie Lockspinner|Some of the workers have said they see a pirate's [[ghost]] around this cave.}}
:{{text|say|Moxie Lockspinner|Where there's pirates, there's usually gold!}}

;Aggro
:{{text|say|First Mate Grogtok|I guard the rum until the captain returns.}}

;Death
:{{text|say|First Mate Grogtok|Captain... I didn't drink any.}}
:{{text|say|Moxie Lockspinner|No gold, but a lot of rum!}}

A cask of [[Long Forgotten Rum]] can be tapped to acquire a mugful.

At the eastern cave:
:{{text|say|Moxie Lockspinner|I feel positive about this cave. I am picturing an awful lot of gold inside.}}

Inside, guarded by two [[Shale Crawler]]s, is a [[Large Pile of Gold]], which starts [[Share the Wealth]].

==Progression==
{{Treasure in Deadwash}}

*Quest name is a reference to "Paper Beats Rock" rule from {{wp|Rock–paper–scissors}} hand game.
