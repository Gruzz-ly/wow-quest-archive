==Objectives==
Investigate and defeat what lies within 4 structures in the [[Forgotten Cove]].

* Areas purged (4)

==Description==
They lurk in the shadows, in the salt-soaked caverns. The dark brine beneath the pure gleam of the surface.

I have seen them. They plague my dreams, their whispers are maddening. They speak of their master, clawing at the barrier...

Search the cliffs for their warrens. Find what lurks within and obliterate them all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ignorance of our enemy will invariably lead to defeat.

==Completion==
The things are driven back, for a time.

==Notes==
There are five caves/rooms around this large area that the minimap will highlight for you, each with three mobs that hit fairly hard.

* [[Dank Grotto]]{{coords|80.50|57.04|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Bleak Sepulcher]]{{coords|83.61|53.93|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Moldering Foyer]]{{coords|81.64|50.29|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Profaned Reliquary|The Profaned Reliquary]]{{coords|82.08|44.7|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Crumbling Chambers]]{{coords|86.58|51.98|Stormsong Valley}}

You will also be debuffed (Strained: The horrors of this place claw at your sanity...) with an energy bar labeled Strain:

: {{text|bossemote|The terrors of this place assault your mind...<br>Damaging abilities in the Forgotten Cove will apply Strain. If strain reaches 100, then your resolve will be tested...}}

Antiquated Idols found in each cave are designed to clear 25 Strain.

However, it appears that this aspect of the questline has largely been disabled as of patch 8.1.0, as there were reports of the quests being very buggy, so perhaps the debuff was directly involved with that. The bar will not fill up by doing damage.

* The next quest will become available anytime between one to three days.
