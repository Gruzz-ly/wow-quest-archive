==Objectives==
Convince the House Stormsong militia to clear the blockade.
* Blockade cleared (0/100%)

==Description==
They've closed off the [[Stormsong Valley|entire valley]]! No wonder so many people have been complaining about trading with the [[Brennadam]] market.

We have to do something about this. These people need to make a living!

You're going to have to be an honorary cadet for me here, <name>. Tell these ruffians to clear the road!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
We have to stop this!

==Completion==
Good work! Now these fine people can go about their lives.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Taelia|I'll try to figure out why the road is closed. See if you can convince the soldiers to clear out!}}

[[Stormsong Sentinel]]s and [[Stormsong Inspector]]s are harassing [[Tiragarde Trader]]s, [[Roughneck Wrangler]]s, [[Anglepoint Fishmonger]]s, [[Algerson Lumberjack]]s, and [[Mildenhall Farmhand]]s.

Talk with the sentinels and inspectors. They have a handful of gossip lines and three gossip options:

*Back of the line if you don't want trouble, bilge rat.
*Only way you're getting in there is through me, pal.
*Your ears broken, <lad/lass>? Valley's closed.
*No papers, no entry. Them's the rules.

*{{gossip|Open this pass at once.}}
*{{gossip|How about some gold?}}
*{{gossip|<Just attack.>}}

Choose whichever option. Be warned that bribes cost {{cost|15}}.

Attacking or choosing the demand option may cause the guard to attack. Guards within 10-15 yards of the actively interacted-with guard will aggro or leave just as the targeted one does.
*{{text|say|Our fleet will crush you!}}
*{{text|say|Kul Tiras belongs to the sea!}}
*{{text|say|Kul Tiras is fish food without us!}}

Damage the guard down to ~25% health and it'll give up and run away.
*{{text|say|Out of my face.}}
*{{text|say|Sod off, louse.}}
*{{text|say|I've had enough of you, anyway.}}

Eight guards will need to be interacted with to complete the objective:
:{{text|say|Foreman Scripps|Pack up, ya worthless swabs. We have bigger fish to fry.}}

Additionally, there's a [[Smuggler's Stash]] hidden underneath the dock at the river. It contains roughly {{cost|80}} and some poor-quality items.
