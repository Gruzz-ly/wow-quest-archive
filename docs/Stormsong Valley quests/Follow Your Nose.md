==Objectives==
Use [[Humphrey]] to find and slay 5 Panicked Tunnelers.
* [[Panicked Tunneler]] slain (5)

==Description==
You there! I could use your help!

The ground isn't safe. The [[quilboar]] have established a network of tunnels below us, allowing them to spring up to ambush people who aren't walking carefully.

Luckily for us, Humphrey here has a nose for the Briarback, and can sniff 'em out even when they're underground. Root a few of them out and let's make the farms a little safer to walk through.

There's a particularly large clump of them in the northeastern fields. Good hunting!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Humphrey's a good boy, isn't he? Of course he is.

==Completion==
Hah! I bet ol' Humphrey gave them a good spook!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sic 'Em!]] before heading out.

While on this quest, players have access to the extra action button:
*{{Abilities|Go Get Them!|range=40|cd=3 sec|Send Humphrey to go investigate the targeted area, uncovering any nearby quilboar traps.|id=259593|icon=inv_pet_mastiff}}

Before getting started, head just southwest to find the mouth of a cave at {{co|51.0|68.8|Stormsong Valley}} leading underneath the stables. Down at the bottom at {{co|49.7|68.1|Stormsong Valley}} is the rare quilboar [[Vinespeaker Ratha]].

Back on the surface, look for active dust clouds and use the extra action button to target the ground near it. Humphrey will run forward and spawn a [[Panicked Tunneler]].

Finally, off to the southeast at {{co|53.7|72.2|Stormsong Valley}} is another cave mouth. The cave system was dug out by the Briarback, but it has been taken over by lichen. Five [[Stormcap Warrior]]s are guarding a [[Lichen-Covered Chest]] at {{co|53.1|69.1|Stormsong Valley}} in the bottom of the cave. The chest contains a piece of Azerite armor!
