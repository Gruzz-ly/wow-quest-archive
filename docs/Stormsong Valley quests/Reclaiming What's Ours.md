==Objectives==
Sound the warhorn and retake control of [[Warfang Hold]] in [[Stormsong Valley]].
*[[Warhorn of the Hold]] sounded

==Description==
I'm impressed. You not only saved our people, but you also managed to kill the leader of the attacking forces.

At the top of this tower is our warhorn. At the signal, our troops will come running and we'll get this hold back under our control.

<Name>, I think you've earned the honors.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good work, <name>{{sic}}

Most of the buildings were easily repaired but we'll have to send to the Warchief for more troops.

We're going to have to fight for our place in this land... of this I'm certain.
