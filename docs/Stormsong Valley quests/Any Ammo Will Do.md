==Objectives==
Collect 20 [[Zeth'jir]] Harpoons on the coast south of [[Fort Daelin]].
* [[Zeth'jir Harpoon]] (20)

==Description==
I'll have some men move some [[cannon]]s down to the sea wall in preparation of whatever ritual is going on down in that delta.

We could use some extra ammo before we spread ourselves too thin though. Luckily, those [[naga]] harpoons work well enough with our mortars. Take down those lances and bring back any harpoons that you find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
We can use the naga's weapons against them!

==Completion==
Great work! Let's hope these harpoons can fire from our cannons.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Piercing the Shield]] and [[Problem Solving with Gunpowder]] before heading out. Exit to the west.

Harpoons are stuck in walls and found in the corpses of [[Shoalbreach Lance]]s. Live Explosive Traps can be set all over the quest area. Kill [[Zeth'jir Seacaller]]s until the channeling rod drops.

==Progression==
{{From the Depths}}
