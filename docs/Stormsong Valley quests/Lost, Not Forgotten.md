==Objectives==
Recover 12 [[soul]]s using the Dead Ringer.
* Souls recovered (12)
* [[Dead Ringer (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
I know not what madness has overtaken my people, but we must stop it together.

Take this bell. It calls the souls of the recently deceased to it for later release. We [[House Stormsong|Stormsong]] do not bury our dead. The tides claim all.

If they will not answer to reason, then we must give them eternal peace. Fallen or not, they are Stormsong.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
It is a grim task, but it is our burden to bear.

==Completion==
It is done. We will release them somewhere a might bit more peaceful.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Means to an End]] and [[The Rising Tide]] before heading out.

On accept of both of Pike's quests:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Let us see this done.}}
:''Pike rises from his knees, Addington in his arms.''

In the [[Addington Shipyards]], find [[Samuel Williams]]:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Those laborers... they're being held by tidesage magic! We must help them.}}

Samuel offers [[Forced Labor]]. Quickly pick it up and turn in to get [[Bound and Oppressed]].

Defeat hostile [[Stormsong Marshal]]s, [[Stormsong Cavalier]]s, [[Tidesage Initiate]]s and [[Stormsong Loyalist]]s, then use the quest item to recover all souls within 10 yards:
*{{text|say|Brother Pike|Tidemother cleanse your wicked flesh.}}
*{{text|say|Brother Pike|May the abyssal depths welcome your weary soul.}}
*{{text|say|Brother Pike|Ebb and flow, from shelf to shore, your spirit's woes.}}
*{{text|say|Brother Pike|Fear not, brother. The waves judge not your surface.}}
*{{text|say|Brother Pike|Wonder not for whom the lighthouse shines. It shines for thee.}}
*{{text|say|Brother Pike|Let your heart know hatred no longer.}}
*{{text|say|Brother Pike|Sea to sea, ashes to ashes, tide to tide.}}
*{{text|say|Brother Pike|Your intrepid spirit will rest forevermore.}}
*{{text|say|Brother Pike|Hear the storm's song, and know peace.}}
*{{text|say|Brother Pike|Let your soul wash away from its mortal shell, and flow into the waters.}}

On recovering the twelfth:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|We must not let these lost souls wander any longer. I would have words with you, <name>.}}

On complete of both of Pike's quests:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|I will prepare the ritual to release these souls. Meet me by the shoreline just north of here.}}
