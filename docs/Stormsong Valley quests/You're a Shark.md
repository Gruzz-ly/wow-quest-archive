==Objectives==
Kill 20 [[murloc]]s.
* [[Zeth'jir Deepfighter]] slain (20)

==Description==
Have you ever been bitten by a [[shark]]? I have, numerous times. It stings.

Murlocs don't usually survive shark attacks.

The ritual I had in mind is ready to cast. Let me know when you're prepared.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Rikal's Ritual Beads]]
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
I can't wait to see how this goes.

==Completion==
How did it feel to be a murloc's greatest fear?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Rikal|I have everything I need. Speak to me when you're ready to begin the ritual.}}

Speak with him:
:Sooner or later the tides will change. They always do.
{{gossip|Start casting the spell, Rikal.}}

Rikal teleports the player out west into the [[Eventide Trench]] in the form of a shark. Like sharks in real life, it can't stop moving forward. Players do not have access to any abilities, but simply running over the [[deep sea murloc]]s is enough to kill them. Don't wander too far away as the shark form will be cancelled. Upon reaching the objective, the shark form is dropped.
