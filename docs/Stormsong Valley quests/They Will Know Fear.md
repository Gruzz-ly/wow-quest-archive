==Objectives==
Terrorize 20 [[Kul Tiran Worker|Kul Tiran Builders]] or [[Tidesage Initiate|Tidesage Recruits]] with the Val'kyr Horn.
* Civilians terrorized (20)
* [[Val'kyr Horn]] (provided)

==Description==
Finally, a chance to strike at the [[Alliance]] AND [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]]!

[[Sagehold]] is crawling with initiate [[tidesages]] studying [[magic]] and Kul Tirans trying to fortify the place against the [[Horde]].

Let's strike some fear into them. Make them rethink trying to help the Alliance fight the Horde.

Take this horn. In my hands, it calls a [[val'kyr]]. In yours, it will sow terror amongst our enemies.

I trust you above all others with this horn. Do not let me down.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Progress==
Did you teach them the meaning of fear?

==Completion==
I could hear their screams from here! Maybe now the Kul Tirans will rethink helping the Alliance.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting [[Commander and Captain]], [[They Will Know Fear]] and [[Scattering Our Enemies]]
:{{Text|Say|[[Thomas Zelling]]|<wheeze> You're not concerned I may attack you? Try to run?}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Lilian Voss]]|You'd be dead before your next pathetic cough, Zelling. Care to test me?}}
:{{Text|Say|Thomas Zelling|No, but can you answer my question? When you become [[Forsaken]], are you purged of any sicknesses?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lilian Voss|Becoming Forsaken is an unpredictable process. Your body and mind are certain to change, but to what extent... it's impossible to know. As is how well you will cope with the process.}}
:{{Text|Say|Thomas Zelling|Did [[Captain Amalia Stone|Captain Stone]] go mad when she turned? I'm well aware of what happened to her.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lilian Voss|We all go a little mad when we become Forsaken. Some more than others.}}
