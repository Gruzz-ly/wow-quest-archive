==Objectives==
Disperse the crowd surrounding [[Brother Pike]].
* Crowd dispersed
* [[Brennadam Citizen]] subdued
* [[Stormwake Pendant]] (Optional)
* [[Military Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
Things are worse than we thought. These people are about to tear [[Brennadam]] apart!

We'll never get a chance to talk to Brother Pike in this mess.

I have an idea, but if it doesn't work, well... I hope you have your running boots on.

Trust me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
We haven't had visitors here in quite some time.

==Completion==
Ah, [[Brother Alen]] sent you. Good.

==Notes==
Accept:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Once you get their attention, I'll get them out of here.}}

Use the whistle:
:{{text|say|Taelia|Citizens, disperse at once!}}
:{{text|say|Brennadam Citizen|Oh yeah, you will surely save us.}}

One of the citizens turns hostile:
:{{text|say|Brennadam Citizen|Stay out of our valley!}}

Take him to 1 health:
:{{text|say|Brennadam Citizen|Stop! I just want my family to be safe again.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|What's going on here, brother?}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|I wish I knew.}}

The optional [[Brennadam]] side quest chain starts from [[Marilyn Hood]] in town with [[Circle the Wagons]]. See that article for more information.

==Progression==
{{A House in Peril}}
