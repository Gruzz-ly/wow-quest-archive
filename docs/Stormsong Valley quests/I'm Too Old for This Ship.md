==Objectives==
Saddle Hurricane and meet [[Dorian Atwater]] at [[Port Fogtide]].
*[[Hurricane (horse)|Hurricane]] saddled

==Description==
If I understood this correctly, the [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lord Admiral]] of the [[Kul Tiran fleet|Kul Tiran navy]] wants me to come out of retirement specifically to build a ship for the [[Anduin Wrynn|king]] of [[Stormwind (kingdom)|Stormwind]].

Can't say I've had THAT request before.

<Dorian leans back in her chair for a moment and rubs at her eyes.>

I'm getting too old for this nonsense.

<Dorian heaves a long sigh.>

Go on out back and saddle Hurricane for me while I pack my things. We will meet you at Port Fogtide.

We're going to need a slip.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I don't go anywhere without my horse, <name>.

==Completion==
Well. This complicates things a touch.

==Notes==
On accepting this quest:
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|You'll find ol' [[Hurricane (horse)|Hurricane]] in the yard. Don't worry, he's not as wild as his name implies. Well, not quite.}}

First attempt to saddle Hurricane:
: ''The horse knocks you away a short distance.''
:{{text|emote|Hurricane snorts irritably.}}
:{{text|yell|Dorian Atwater|[[Sal Atwater|Sal]]! Where'd I leave my tools?}}
:{{text|say|Sal Atwater|Out back, dearest!}}
:{{text|emote|Dorian Atwater mutters something about back pain under her breath.}}
:''Dorian comes out the backdoor, gathers up a toolbox in her hands from on top of a crate and approaches Hurricane and the [[adventurer]].''

Second attempt:
: ''On approach, he runs off a distance in the opposite direction and faces you.''
:{{text|emote|Hurricane stomps away from you with an indignant whinny.}}

Third attempt:
:''Hurricane, finally saddled, walks forward and allows Dorian to hold his reigns.''
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Aren't you just the sweetest little horse in [[Stormsong Valley|the valley]]? Yes, you are!}}
: ''She leads Hurricane over to the front path, stopping to speak to Sal.''
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|You know the drill, Sal. Get the cart and meet me at the lumber mill.}}
:{{text|say|Sal Atwater|Be gentle with <name>, sweet pea.}}
:''Dorian leads Hurricane to the road east toward [[Tidecross]].''
