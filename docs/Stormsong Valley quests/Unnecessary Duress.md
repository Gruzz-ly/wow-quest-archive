==Objectives==
Rejuvenate 8 [[Exhausted Laborer]]s.
* Laborers rejuvenated (8)
* [[Imbued Tidewater]] (provided)

==Description==
Lord Stormsong has never taken kindly to dissent, but this is madness. These laborers are being worked to death!

[[Brother Addington|Addington]] was a good man. We cannot stand for such cruelty.

Take this vial and apply it to the laborers. It contains blessed seawater that will rejuvenate their strength.

Avoid engaging what troops you can. They are merely following orders. More death will only worsen matters.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Tidespeaker Gloves
|Darkwater Gloves
|Stormchaser Gloves
|Dread Corsair Gauntlets
|Tidespeaker Sandals
|Darkwater Boots
|Stormchaser Boots
|Dread Corsair Sabatons
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
We must help these poor souls.

==Completion==
There is much work to be done, but not at the cost of our own people's lives.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Proclamation Investigation]] and [[Haywire Harvesters]] before heading out.

Just east of the quest givers is a rare mob, [[Foreman Scripps]].

The tidewater has a ten-yard radius, so take advantage of it:
*{{Text|say|Exhausted Laborer|A thousand thanks, stranger!}}
*{{Text|say|Exhausted Laborer|Foreman Scripps has lost his mind. They all have!}}
*{{Text|say|Exhausted Laborer|I knew the sea had not forsaken us!}}
*{{Text|say|Exhausted Laborer|I thought I was going to pass out!}}
*{{Text|say|Exhausted Laborer|The harvesters have turned on us!}}
*{{Text|say|Exhausted Laborer|They won't let us leave!}}
*{{Text|say|Exhausted Laborer|Tides bless you!}}
*{{Text|say|Exhausted Laborer|Tides preserve me!}}

On return:
:''Pike has gotten Addington off the hook.''
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|You were too good for this world, brother. I will make sure you receive a proper burial.}}
