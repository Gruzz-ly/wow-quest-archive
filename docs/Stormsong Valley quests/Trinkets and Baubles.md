==Objectives==
Recover 3 crates of Stolen Supplies.
*[[Stolen Supplies (Stormsong Valley)]] (3)

==Description==
Beneath the tides, these terrors do not see fit to stay within their warrens.

They have emerged in the night, stealing away to the villages and indulging in their avarice. They will use the provisions against us, to serve in their rituals. Rituals of summoning and communion with powers too terrible to comprehend. 

The populace is no concern of mine anymore, but I would not see these briny thieves to have their way. Relieve them of their plunder, and let them learn a bitter lesson.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Where there is no peril, there can be no glory!

==Completion==
Paid for in blood.

== Notes ==
The supplies, neatly stacked in a pile, are in the [[Bleak Sepulcher]]{{coords|83.61|53.93|Stormsong Valley}}, [[Moldering Foyer]]{{coords|81.64|50.29|Stormsong Valley}} and [[Profaned Reliquary|The Profaned Reliquary]]{{coords|82.08|44.7|Stormsong Valley}}, but it seems one of the other two caves ([[Dank Grotto]]{{coords|80.50|57.04|Stormsong Valley}} and [[Crumbling Chambers]]{{coords|86.58|51.98|Stormsong Valley}}) need to be cleared before a third set of supplies will spawn.
