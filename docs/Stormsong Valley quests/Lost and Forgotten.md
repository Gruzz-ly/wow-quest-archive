==Objectives==
Fill the Dead Ringer with [[soul]]s.
* [[:Dead Ringer]] filled (0/100%)

==Description==
We have seen firsthand the depravity that has taken hold of my [[Tidesages|former brethren]]. The time has come to put an end to it.

The path ahead is no doubt packed with [[Lord Stormsong]]'s [[cultist]]s and their soulwrought [[elemental]]s. I will absorb their souls as they fall with the Dead Ringer, as you once did.

However, there will be no release for these fiends... not this time. We will need them to pry open the final door to the [[Shrine of the Storm|Shrine]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
This burden is ours to bear, but I am glad we do not bear it alone.

==Completion==
Mourn not for the fallen. We do what we must to save our people.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Sealed Fate]] before heading out.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|[[Taelia]]|We're with you!}}

Brother Pike, Taelia, and [[Samuel Williams]] join the adventurer.

Step on to [[Kraken's Reach]]:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Tread carefully. This span's name is well-earned.}}
:{{text|say|Samuel Williams|Writhing... twisting... the whispers...}}

Start killing everything that moves.
* [[Abyssal Zealot]] (3%)
* [[Abyssal Prophet]], [[Fallen Hullwarden]], [[Twisted Current]] (5%)
* Charged Gale slain (6-7%)
