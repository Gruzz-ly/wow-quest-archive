==Objectives==
Use the [[:Rod of Tides]] to open the [[Path of Storms]].
* Path of Storms opened

==Description==
The bridge that once crossed this span is the only land route to the Shrine. 

It appears [[Lord Stormsong]] has sealed it to buy himself more time. We have been attempting to reopen the way to no avail.

However, the Rod of Tides you recovered may prove our solace. Veteran [[tideguard]]s use it as a key of sorts to maintain the Path of Storms across these dangerous waters.

We will begin the ritual once more... if you will wield the rod.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Now that Lord Stormsong is aware of our intentions every moment is precious.

==Completion==
The way is opened at last.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|We must ensure Victoria's sacrifice was not in vain. Her staff is the key to opening the way to the Shrine.}}

*{{Abilities|Rod of Tides|Invoke the power within the Rod to open the Path of Storms.|notes=1.3 sec cast|id=267277|icon=inv_staff_2h_kultirasquest_b_02}}

:{{text|say|Brother Pike|This darkness shall not bar our path.}}
:{{text|yell|Brother Pike|The Shrine must be opened once more. Our redemption has come!}}

==Progression==
{{At the Edge of Madness}}
