==Objectives==
Clean 8 [[Oily Sandbill Piper]]s
* Sandbills cleaned (8)

==Description==
The [[Venture Company]] contaminates our pristine waters with toxic oil.

My people are strong and will endure this until the time is right to strike back. The creatures with soft skins cannot wait. We must act now and save them from this danger.

Collect and scrub clean any oily sandbill pipers you see. Quickly, before it's too late!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Nola's Shawl
|Tidespeaker Armbands
|Darkwater Armbands
|Stormchaser Wristguards
|Dread Corsair Wristguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
Don't waste time. There is much cleaning to do.

==Completion==
These smallest of victories are the foundation for the Venture Companies defeat.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Swimming Lessons]] and [[Don't Play with Matches]] before heading out.

Start killing a path north along the coast, cleaning bills (while mounted!) and finding scrolls along the way. The last scroll is out west north of [[Fort Daelin]].

==Progression==
{{The Jeweled Coast}}
