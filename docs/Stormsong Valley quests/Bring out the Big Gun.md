==Objectives==
Cannon delivered.
* Cannon Delivered

==Description==
<The cannon here is still in good condition. It's a lot of firepower to slow down the Horde.

Taking this to [[Lea Martinel]] at [[Eckhart Lodge]] would really help their defenses.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 50x [[War Resources]]
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Take the cannon to Lea Martinel at Eckhart Lodge.

==Completion==
This is an unexpected surprise!

==Notes==
While in the [[Windshorn Hills]] for [[Smells Like Trouble]], [[Dangerous Game]], and [[Never Outgunned]], find the Cannon almost due east of the [[Eckhart Lodge]], which starts this quest.

After picking up the quest, players will drag the cannon, without apparent speed penalty, around the quest area. Get it back to the marked area at Eckhart Lodge to complete the objective.

On approach:
:{{text|say|Lea Martinel|Now that's the kind of firepower we need!}}
