==Objectives==
Find [[Farmer Burton]] at his farm.

==Description==
If you've got a minute, there's a farmer out there who hasn't made it back yet.

Name's Burton and he's out by a farm right next to [[Briarback Kraul]]. If the [[quilboar]] were to strike out, his farm is one of the first in their way.

I haven't heard anything from Burton. He mostly relied on his mechanical farmers to help him, so we don't know the situation out there.

Head to the west and keep an eye out for him, would you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
I stayed behind to see if I could help... Everyone else made it back okay, right?

==Notes==
While passing through the [[Amber Waves]] on the way to [[Briarback Kraul]] and farmers [[Farmer Burton|Burton]] and [[Farmer Goldfield|Goldfield]], keep an eye out for [[Farmer Max]] at {{co|55.0|68.0|Stormsong Valley}}. He offers some side quests: [[Raiders of the Lost Crop]] and [[Grain Drain]].

Also, in the Amber Waves town, [[Houndmaster Archibald]] offers some other standalone side-quests [[Follow Your Nose]] and [[Sic 'Em!]]
