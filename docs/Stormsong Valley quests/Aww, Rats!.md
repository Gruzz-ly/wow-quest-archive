==Objectives==
Collect 8 Bilge Rats.
* [[Bilge Rat]]s collected (8)
* [[Bug Zapper]] (provided)

==Description==
I didn't sign up for this! I just want to get back to the simple things, like grinding wheat and drinking mead.

As if things couldn't get any worse around here, there's an army of rats ransacking the shed and I don't have the stomach to exterminate them.

Here, I got this off some crazy [[gnome]] that stopped into port recently. I thought maybe it'd help with the [[bee]]s. Maybe you can try it on the [[rat]]s?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Just hand me the rats, I'll drop 'em off in the woods.

==Completion==
Thank you so much. I'll get rid of these little guys.

==Progression==
