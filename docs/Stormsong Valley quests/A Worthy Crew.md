==Objectives==
Recruit a crew for the new vessel.
* Speak to [[Tandred Proudmoore]]
* [[Brother Pike]] recruited
* [[Lieutenant Tarenfold]] recruited
* [[Outriggers]] [[Rosaline Madison|recruited]]
* [[Dorian Atwater|Boatswain]] recruited

==Description==
If [[Dorian Atwater|Dorian]] really can build this ship before the day is out, we need to find a crew for the new vessel.

This crew should represent the best of [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] society, the highest naval prowess, and the faith of our people as we present this gift to [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]].

I have a [[captain (rank)|captain]] in mind, but you'll want to speak to him yourself. I will let him decide who else he wants aboard.

Seek out my brother, [[Tandred Proudmoore]], in [[Boralus]]. He will help you fill out the ranks from there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found a suitable crew?

==Completion==
This is a fine group you've assembled. Very well done.

==Notes==
Speak to [[Tandred Proudmoore]] at [[Proudmoore Keep]]:
:<He stares out over the city and fails to notice your approach.>
::{{gossip|[[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] sent me to speak with you.}}
:''Tandred faces the [[adventurer]].''
:{{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|Aye, I was just thinking on her request.}}
:{{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|I've a few in mind, but some of them might take more convincing than others.}}
:{{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|Brother Pike is currently here in Boralus. He's my first choice for a [[tidesage]]. No ship sails without one.}}
:{{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|For my master gunner, I'll have none other than Lieutenant Tarenfold. He should still be stationed at [[Vigil Hill]].}}
:{{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|Meet me at [[Outrigger Post]], where we can find the rest of our crew.}}
: ''He heads off down the stairs.''

Note: The next three crewmembers can be recruited in any order.

Speak to [[Brother Pike]] at the [[Tradewinds Market]] dock:
:You walk with purpose, <name>.
:How can I help?
::{{gossip|Tandred Proudmoore is putting together a crew. He needs a tidesage. Are you interested?}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|It has been too long since I have stood upon the seas.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|The legacy of the tidesages has been tainted, but perhaps I can rebuild it.}}
:''Brother Pike laughs.''
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Besides, how could I refuse the [[Lord Admiral]]'s brother?}}

Speak to [[Lieutenant Tarenfold]] at [[Vigil Hill]]:
:Where are [[Irontide Raiders|they]] getting [[Irontide Skyrider|all these parrots]]?
:Bah. What do you need, <name>?
::{{gossip|Tandred Proudmoore is putting together a crew. He needs a master gunner. Are you interested?}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Tarenfold|And leave this gate undefended?}}
: ''The marine to his right speaks up.''
:{{text|say|Vigil Hill Marine|You've been taking pot shots at parrots for a while now, sir.}}
:{{text|say|Vigil Hill Marine|We're more than capable of holding the hill.}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Tarenfold|Hmph. Point taken.}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Tarenfold|Alright, lads and lasses. Looks like I'm off to sea.}}
: ''He rides off to the east.''

Speak to [[Rosaline Madison]] at [[Outrigger Post]]:
:Good day, mainlander.
:What can the [[Outriggers]] do for you? Come to harpoon some beasts?
::{{gossip|Tandred Proudmoore is putting together a crew. He needs a first mate. Are you interested?}}
:''Rosaline laughs.''
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|You want me to be your WHAT?}}
:{{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|I know how it sounds, but I need a first mate I can count on! And that means you!}}
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|You expect me to be flattered? I'm a captain. The Outriggers are my crew.}}
:{{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|They'll still be your crew! I want all of you on my ship when we set sail under the [[Alliance]]'s flag.}}
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|The Alliance? Does that mean we'll be giving the [[Horde]] [[Outrigger Outfitters|some payback?]]}}
:{{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|Well... I would assume so, yes.}}
:''Rosaline salutes.''
:{{text|say|Rosaline Madison|Lead with that next time, Captain.}}
:{{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|Hah! Excellent. I couldn't ask for a finer crew. Pack up and follow me.}}
: ''As Rosaline and [[Okri Putterwrench]] head for the [[flight master]], Tandred turns to you before joining them.''
:{{text|say|Tandred Proudmoore|<Name>, there's someone else I want to recruit. Meet me at [[Port Fogtide]] once you've spoken to everyone.}}

Finally, at Port Fogtide, a large number of people have gathered. The [[Outriggers]], the [[Thornspeakers]], a handful of [[Algerson Lumberjack]]s, [[Chelsea Wright]] and [[Princess (wicker beast)|Princess]], [[Cyrus Crestfall]], [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] and [[Katherine Proudmoore]], and the rest of Tandred's crew watch as Tandred speaks to his final recruit:
:{{text|say|Captain Tandred Proudmoore|Name a better boatswain and I'll take them instead. You wanted the best. You are the best.}}

Speak to [[Dorian Atwater]]:
:I do not like the way this young man is looking at me.
::{{gossip|Well, you heard the man.}}
: ''Dorian responds flatly.''
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|I'm retired.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Tandred Proudmoore|How can you build something this magnificent and not want to sail it into the sunset? She's beautiful!}}
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|You're not going to let this go, are you?}}
: ''A cheeky grin can be heard in Tandred's tone.''
:{{text|say|Captain Tandred Proudmoore|Not a chance.}}
:{{text|say|Sal Atwater|I can mind the house, dear. Go on. Have an adventure.}}
: ''At her husband's gentle encouragement, Dorian blows out an exasperated sigh.''
:{{text|say|Dorian Atwater|Fine. But you'll be getting an earful if you damage my ship.}}
