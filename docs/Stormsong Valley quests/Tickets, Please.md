==Objectives==
Eject 5 ticketless Visiting Spectators from [[Warfang Hold]].
* [[Visiting Spectator|Ticketless spectator]] ejected (5)

==Description==
There's another problem we could use your help with, <class>.

[[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] knew this meeting was going to be a big deal, so naturally he decided to sell tickets. The thing is, I've done a headcount here, and we've got a lot more people here than tickets sold, so some of these spectators are trying to pull a fast one.

Most of our muscle is out in the [[Clearcut]] getting killed by [[Spy|spies]], so we could use the help. Care to make an honest wage?

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:
|Commemorative Ticket
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The nerve of these people!

==Completion==
<Kazit makes some tallies in his notebook.>

Yeah, that's lookin' about right. Here's your pay.

Hey, don't give me that look. I said an honest wage, not a good one!

==Notes==
;Speaking with [[Visiting Spectator]]s
*The Dark Lady's got stones for holding this meeting right under the Alliance's nose.
:Talk about a power play!
*Why would all the leaders be summoned all the way out here?
:Something big must be happening.
*This is an odd place to call a council.
:I wonder what's going on?
*It's a big risk gathering so many of our leaders right in the middle of Alliance territory.
:What is Sylvanas trying to prove?
:{{Gossip|I'll need to see your ticket.}}

;Responses
*{{Text|say|A little over dressed for a ticket-taker, wouldn't you say? Here you go.}}
*{{Text|say|Here it is. Paid a hefty sum for it, too.}}
*{{Text|say|I still can't believe I had to pay to be here.}}
*{{Text|say|Right here. I still can't believe I had to pay to be here.}}
*{{Text|say|Those goblins got you playing enforcer? Fine, here it is.}}

;Not having a ticket
*Ticket?
:Oh, I must've left it in my other greaves...
*I'm on the special guest list.
:Just ask Gallywix, he'll vouch for me.
*No I don't have a stupid ticket.
:What are you going to do about it?
*Are you kidding? At the prices these goblins are charing?
:Talk about highway robbery!
:{{Gossip|If you don't have a ticket, you'll have to leave.}}

;Responses
*{{Text|say|No need to get testy. I'll leave.}}
*{{Text|say|I... uh... guess I'll show myself out...}}
*{{Text|say|My, that's a big weapon you have. I think I'll go.}}

;Others turn hostile and attack you
*{{Text|say|You just got a ticket for a good beating!}}
*{{Text|say|Don't try to order me around!}}
*{{Text|say|You can't make me leave!}}
*{{Text|say|I'll show you where you can stick your "ticket!"}}

;After being defeated
*{{Text|say|I'm getting out of here!}}
*{{Text|say|I yield! I yield!}}
*{{Text|say|Stop! Fine, I'll go...}}
*{{Text|say|Yeah, I guess you're pretty tough...}}
