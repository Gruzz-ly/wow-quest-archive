==Objectives==
Recover 8 Warship Blueprints.
* [[Warship Blueprint]] (8)

==Description==
There was somethin' off with the ship we were building in the yard. I never saw the blueprints, but I've built enough ships in my day to know it wasn't business as usual.

They've kept all the pages under tight guard in the [[Brineworks]] up the road lately. Full on militia.

If you can get your hands on enough of them pages, we oughta be able to figure out what [[Lord Stormsong]] and his boys are schemin'.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 50x [[War Resources]]
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Any luck recovering those blueprints?

==Completion==
I knew they'd still have 'em! If you ever want something gone, lad you'd best destroy it yourself.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Rearmament]] before heading out.

On the way into the [[Brineworks]], find the corpse of [[Chief Architect Wilson]] on the road. He's holding a [[Charred Note]] which starts [[The Missing Link]].

Inside the town, loot a dozen Stormfused Weapons, kill [[Shipwright Turncoat]]s, [[Brinebrawn Cannoneer]]s, and [[Stormfused Strikesmith]]s for a [[Warship Blueprint]] or eight, and find and defeat [[Tideguard Pontus]] for the [[Architect's Cipher]].

Watch out for the rare ''elite'' [[Reinforced Hullbreaker]] patrolling town. It is fixed at level 122 with 1.6 million health. However, there is a standard rare elemental on top of the hill just outside of town, [[Galestorm]]. There's also a corrupted pod of dolphins in the river just north of town, comprised of a [[Corrupted Tideskipper]] and three [[Juvenile Tideskipper]]s.
