==Objectives==
Destroy the stockpiles of supplies.
* [[Preserved Bramble Spores|Eastern stockpile]] destroyed {{co|46.8|79.6|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Quill Venom|Central Stockpile]] destroyed {{co|44.6|78.9|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Giant-Sized Totem|Western stockpile]] destroyed {{co|42.5|79.2|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
The [[quilboar]] are up to something, something big. You need to stop it!

They've been busy bringing supplies up to the caves above their sanctum. Preserved thorns, cauldrons of venom, giant [[totem]]s...

They're preparing for war.

Get up there and destroy those stockpiles before they can be used against the citizens of the [[Stormsong Valley|valley]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
I hope I'm wrong, but I've got a bad feeling about this.

==Completion==
Those supplies you destroyed should set them back. They must have been saving them for a while...

==Notes==
Pick up [[War Pigs]] before heading out. Stay on [[Quilltop]].

While out and about, look for an [[Empty Crate (Stormsong Valley)|Empty Crate]] at {{co|46.3|77.0|Stormsong Valley}} which starts [[Steal Them Back]].

On completion of both, a brief cutscene tracks down the caves and shows an [[ettin]], [[Bramblefist the Maddened]]. Pick up [[Terror of the Kraul]] to continue.

==Progression==
{{Briarback Kraul}}
