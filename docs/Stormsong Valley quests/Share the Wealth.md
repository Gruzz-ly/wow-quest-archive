==Objectives==
Take the gold to [[Leo Shealds|Shealds]].

==Description==
<Though old and mud covered, this is still gold, lots of it! It's not enough to be [[Nedly Grinner|Nedly]]'s legendary lost treasure, but it's still several thousand in gold coins.

It's a significant find, and should be returned to Shealds to be split among all the workers.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Some people would have just run off with this, but you didn't! We'll split this up into two hundred and fourteen shares. Here's your cut.

==Notes==
While in the [[Drowned Lands]] on [[Bomb Beats Rock]], the [[Large Pile of Gold]] found inside the eastern cave starts this quest.

This quest concludes the required part of the "Treasure in Deadwash" chapter of the [[Stormsong Valley storyline]]. The quest chain continues with Moxie's quests, starting with [[Don't Turtle]].
