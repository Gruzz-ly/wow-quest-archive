==Objectives==
Place 3 [[Fog Ward]]s in [[Port Fogtide]].
* Southern Fog Ward placed
* Western Fog Ward placed
* Northern Fog Ward placed

==Description==
When I was younger, I hid my [[Boat|ships]] out of vanity.

I often went through a number of designs before I was satisfied. I didn't want anyone to see that. It might ruin the mystique, I reasoned.

Now... I think it best to hide this ship from the likes of those [[K'thir|tentacle-faced creeps]]. I don't think they intend to let us build unchallenged.

Go into the port and place my wards around the main slip.

You'll see what they do.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you place the wards?

==Completion==
That should give us some cover. Hopefully they stay away long enough to finish construction.
