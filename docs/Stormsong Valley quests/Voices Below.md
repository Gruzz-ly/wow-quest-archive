==Objectives==
Help [[Brother Pike]] investigate his omen.
* Omen investigated {{co|66.4|50.7|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
The others forged ahead to [[Port Fogtide]]. I doubt they will receive a warm welcome. 

We are to meet them there. However, there is something I must do first.

Despite [[Wavespeaker Reid|Reid's]] retreat I still feel a terrible darkness nearby; I wish to listen to the tides for answers. I would appreciate your joining me in case more danger strays into our path.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
We must help the others before they are overrun!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|There is a bridge nearby that has clear sight of the [[Shrine of the Storm]]. The omen comes from there.}}
:''Pike mounts up and heads northwest along the path.''
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Long has my order listened to the sea to guide our ships and our people. Gentle whispers, imperceptible to most.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Over time, the whispers... changed. At times they were demanding, even violent.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|We attempted to guard ourselves against them, to resist them, but I fear we may have failed.}}
:''Pike stops just past the midpoint of the bridge and looks northeast at the Shrine.''

Speak with him:
:I can feel it strongly here. Something dark stirs.
{{gossip|What is it?}}

A cutscene plays:
:''On the ship in the bay, Lord Stormsong appears from below deck, flanked by [[k'thir]] and [[faceless one]]s.''
:{{text|say|Lord Stormsong|Brother and sisters, behold our glorious destiny!}}

Back at the dock, Pike mounts up and keeps heading northeast into [[Tidecross]]:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Those... things... are k'thir. They come from the darkest reaches beneath the tides.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Most think them mere legend. Stories used to warn of the danger of peering too deep with our magic.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|If they walk among us, the fleet is in gave danger.}}
:''Pike arrives at Tidecross and starts conjuring Rising Tide.''
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|We stand with you. For the Storm's Wake!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Samuel Williams|Those bastards will pay for what they've done.}}
:{{text|yell|Samuel Williams|For Addington! For Stormsong Valley!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Sam, no!}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Let him go, Taelia!}}
