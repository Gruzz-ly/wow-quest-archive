==Objectives==
Defeat [[Lord Stormsong]] in the [[Shrine of the Storm]].
*Defeat [[Lord Stormsong (tactics)|Lord Stormsong]]

==Description==
We must not let Lord Stormsong finish his work.

If he delivers the [[Kul Tiran fleet|fleet]] to [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]], all of [[Kul Tiras]] will be vulnerable. Countless innocents will perish -- or worse.

There is no time to wait for more of the [[Storm's Wake]] to arrive. We finish this now, for the good of all who call this [[Stormsong Valley|valley]] home.

We finish this for [[Samuel Williams|Samuel]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|131|65|}}
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (600x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* +500 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
I pray we are not too late. The fleet must return home.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|We must act now if we are to spare the fleet from Azshara's grasp.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|We will make Lord Stormsong pay for his transgressions... or perish trying.}}
:''Pike mounts and heads into the instance.''

On complete:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|My magic is strongest here. If there is any hope the fleet can yet be found, now is the time to try.}}
: ''Pike walks to the center and casts Mariner's Beacon: {{text|bossemote|Searches the tides for the Kul Tiran fleet.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Yes... I can sense the ships... our fleet! The dark mists surrounding them are dissipating!}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Though I cannot call our mariners home, at least we know those ships are out there... somewhere. The fate of our fleet lies with the Proudmoores now.}}
