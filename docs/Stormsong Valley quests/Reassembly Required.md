==Objectives==
Collect [[Spy]] Salvage from [[Horde]] Forces.
* [[Salvaged Parts (Stormsong Valley)]] (8)

==Description==
[[Mathias Shaw|Master Shaw]] wanted me to rebuild the listening posts the Horde destroyed when they started to clear the area in preparation for whatever they are planning.

I managed to salvage most of the parts for one, but I'm missing a few.

Fortunately for us, I've been watching the workers and they've been picking up the pieces of the destroyed machines. Go get our [[Technology|tech]] back and I can take care of the rest.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I am so excited! I love getting to work with our spy tech! Did you find what we need?

==Completion==
Yes! This is precisely what I needed.

==Notes==
