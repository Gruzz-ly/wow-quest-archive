==Description==
When a new [[queen]] is born and old enough to start proliferating her own hive, she will leave the nest. Her scent will attract some of the hive to fly with her to their new home. This one likely never got the chance to do so, thanks to you.

The Hivemother will be interested in this item.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
