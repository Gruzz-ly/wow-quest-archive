==Objectives==
Help [[Rexxar]] track down a [[tidesage]].
* Help Rexxar locate a tidesage
* [[Thomas Zelling|Tidesage]] located

==Description==
I have tracked a tidesage to a camp nearby. He has been staying there with his family.

Be warned, tidesages are powerful foes. They have mastery over all the [[Elemental|elements]], and some even manipulate the [[Void]].

If this man is with his family, it means he may not give up so easily. 

Let us hope he's smart enough to keep them out of this.

Come.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Honorbound|The Honorbound]]

==Completion==
Let's hope this tidesage is telling the truth or else it's about to get very bloody.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|[[Rexxar]]|[[Misha]], stay here. The rest of us will track this tidesage, and then Lilian will do... whatever it is you plan on doing.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Lilian Voss]]|Don't care for the details, Rexxar?}}
:{{Text|say|Rexxar|No, I do not.}}
:''Rexxar and Lilian leave the Great Hall.''

;At Tidebreak Summit
{{Gossip|Any clues on where we can find a tidesage?}}

:{{Text|say|Rexxar|Hrm, the tidesage was here some time ago, I watched him protect and serve his family.}}
:{{Text|say|Lilian Voss|Well, I could make a few threats to the woman, see if she gives us some details...}}
:{{Text|say|Rexxar|There is no honor in that. We can just ask. We have no qualms with a crying mother.}}
:''Rexxar approaches [[Julia Zelling]] who is surrounded by [[Matthew Zelling]] and [[Hannah Zelling]].''
:{{Text|say|Julia Zelling|The [[Horde]]... are you here to take more from me? My husband is dying, I'm penniless... just leave my children be, please.}}
:{{Text|say|Rexxar|All I want to know is your husband's location. No harm will come to you or your family.}}
:{{Text|say|Julia Zelling|Anything you do couldn't be worse than the disease... he went east to die in peace, away from the children. Please, just leave us be.}}
:{{Text|say|Rexxar|We must hurry if we are to get this tidesage's help.}}
:''Rexxar and Lilian run north.''

;On approach
:{{Text|Say|Thomas Zelling|The Void, the elements <cough>...can nothing stop this damned disease? Why did it have to end like this?}}

;Gossip
<cough> The Horde. Here I thought I would die in peace.

Well? What are you waiting for?

{{Gossip|I'm here to ask you for help, not to kill you.}}

:''[[Lilian Voss]] jumps down from above while Rexxar approaches from behind.''
:{{Text|Say|Lilian Voss|<Name> is right, sort of. You won't get hurt if you help us, preferably before you die.}}
:{{Text|say|Thomas Zelling|One of the [[Forsaken]]. Perhaps it's a <cough> sign. Tell me, miss...?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lilian Voss|Lilian Voss. I'm the one asking the questions. Can you track people? Objects?}}
:{{Text|Say|Thomas Zelling|Miss Voss. Did you retain any sicknesses, any diseases that you had in life when you were returned?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lilian Voss|Do not try my patience, or I'll make you wish your disease already killed you. I need to see how good your magic is before we go any further.}}
:{{Text|Say|Thomas Zelling|Is my family safe?}}
:{{Text|Say|Lilian Voss|I said do not try my--}}
:{{Text|Say|Thomas Zelling|I must know if my family is safe! <cough>}}
:{{Text|Say|Rexxar|They are safe. Help us and we will continue to ensure their safety.}}
:{{Text|Say|Thomas Zelling|<cough> I... I will do what I can, Miss Voss. You want someone or something located, correct? Let me see what I can do without my book...}}
:{{Text|Say|Thomas Zelling|There are [[Alliance]] and [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiran]] forces at [[Sagehold]]. They are awaiting reinforcements and are vulnerable to an attack at this moment.}}
:{{Text|Say|Lilian Voss|Good. Prove how useful you can be to the Horde and we'll see how much longer we let you live this life.}}
