==Objectives==
Charter a ferry to Stormsong Monastery.
*Ferry chartered to [[Stormsong Monastery]]

==Description==
The [[Tidesages|tidesage]] order has a sizable monastery right here in [[Boralus]]. I say we start our search for the fleet there.

Someone there has to know something, right? You don't just lose the entire legendary Kul Tiran fleet on accident!

We'll need to take a ferry over to the monastery. Make sure you bring your pass with you!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
I've never been to the monastery before.

==Completion==
Keep your eyes open. I'm not sure we're entirely welcome.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Cyrus Crestfall|Be careful out there, Taelia. I don't trust those hooded sages one bit.}}
:{{Text|say|Taelia|I'll be fine, Cyrus. I can protect myself. Besides, I have the [[Alliance]] [[adventurer|emissary]] by my side!}}
:''Taelia leaves.''

Follow Taelia as she makes her way to [[Will Melborne]], the ferry master:
:{{Text|say|Taelia|Normally, I'd offer you a ride on [[Galeheart]], but the tidesages only allow visitors by boat.}}
:{{Text|say|Taelia|Most people here look to the sea for guidance the same way others look to the Light, but the tidesages have a much deeper connection with the water.}}
:{{Text|say|Taelia|They're a little mysterious, but they're important to Kul Tiras. They help bring fish to the nets here, and rain to the fields in the valley.}}
:{{Text|say|Taelia|They also bless every last Kul Tiran ship. That's what really sets them apart from the visiting vessels you see in port.}}
:{{Text|say|Taelia|Anyway, time to put that ferry pass to good use!}}

Speak with Will:
:Looking for a ferry?
:{{gossip|We need a ferry to the Stormsong Monastery.}}
:''Two rowers paddle Taelia and the adventurer to Stormsong Monastery.''
:{{text|say|Taelia|I wish you could see the fleet. I think even some as well-traveled as you would be impressed!}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Now nobody seems to know why the fleet still hasn't returned home.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|People say the tidesages have lost their magic, but I think they're just vying for power like Ashvane.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|One way or another, we need the tidesages' help... now more than ever.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|Not just to bring the fleet home, but to make Kul Tiras whole again... or "cure the infection," as Cyrus likes to say.}}

The ferry drops Taelia and the adventurer off at [[Stormsong Monastery]]. Don't feel too off-put by the Discomforting Gaze. Turn in to Taelia.

==Beta version==
