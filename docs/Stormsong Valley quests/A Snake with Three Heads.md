==Objectives==
Slay the three naga channelers.
* [[Lady Rash'iss]] slain {{co|32.1|55.1|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Binder Ser'less]] slain {{co|32.7|54.0|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Binder Nalashj]] slain {{co|32.7|56.0|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Zeth'jir Channeling Rod]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that all of the preparation has been done, it's time to tackle the main threat.

You can use the channeling rod you just found in conjunction with this scroll I got from [[Rikal]] to break the shields around the naga leaders in the delta.

Hurry! Stop them before they finish their summoning!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
If they finish their summoning, that wall is done for.

==Completion==
Well, the bubble seems to be gone, but I don't like the looks of that whirlpool.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Clearing the Delta]] before heading out. Exit to the southwest.

The three named mobs are in small shields around the big shield in the [[Eventide Delta]]. Use the quest item to pierce the shield of a channeler.

==Progression==
{{From the Depths}}
