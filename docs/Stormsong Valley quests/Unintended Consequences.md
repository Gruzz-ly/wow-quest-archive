==Objectives==
Find the Void Stone in [[Drustvar]].
* Void Stone found
* Stop the ritual
* Void Stone taken
* [[Void Stone (quest item)]] activated
* [[Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<[[Xal'atath]] speaks once more.>

The servants of [[N'Zoth]] prepare for their master's return. They intend to conjure a scouring storm to wash away all unbelievers.

The particular ritual they will invoke requires three ancient artifacts. One of void, one of storm, and one of ocean.

Even now, I hear the void relic calling to me. It is being empowered... or corrupted, I am not sure which. I see it upon a cliff, overlooking a vast sea.

Come, <class>. We can find a much better use for such a prize.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Glowing Azerite Crystal]] (250 [[Azerite (resource)]])
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Yes... this form should do nicely.

==Completion==
Do not be distracted. We have more to do.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|The [[naga]] seek relics of power to fuel their ritual. They intend to summon a scouring storm that will wipe [[Azeroth|this world]] clean of unbelievers. Fanatics...}}
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|I realize it may be... disconcerting to converse with a weapon. Be at ease. I merely wish to see you reach your full potential.}}
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|Why, just recently I helped another mortal hero defeat the [[Burning Legion]]. My selfless sacrifice left me weakened. Sadly, [[Adventurer#Broken Isles|that priest]] proved... shortsighted.}}
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|You, though... I sense you are truly destined for greatness. We will accomplish remarkable things together, you and I. Magnificent things.}}

The ritual is taking place at [[Falcon's Rest]], where [[Inanis]] is channeling on the Void Stone surrounded by [[Deep Watcher]]s. On arrival:
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|That which we seek is nearby. A relic of concentrated void energy.}}
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|There! Those novices are performing some sort of ritual on the stone.}}
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|Stop them and take what is ours.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Deep Watcher]]|[Shath'Yar] Ma sk'magg ni arwi Ma zzof ag ez uulwi}}
:{{Text|say|[[Deep Watcher]]|[Shath'Yar] Oou oou ryiu nuq Yrr par'okoth yrr vorzz}}
:{{Text|say|Deep Watcher|[Common] Nagan vohl ras eynes Va dana vandar hir ruff ras vrum}} <!-- this is Horde's perspective -->

Engage the Deep Watchers:
:{{Text|say|Deep Watcher|They come! They come!}}

On death:
*{{Text|say|Deep Watcher|Oblivion... embrace me...}}
*{{Text|say|Deep Watcher|Master... I come...}}

After killing all three:
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|Does she actually think she can break open the stone? Fool. Were we not pressed for time, I would enjoy watching her fall.}}

Aggro Inanis:
:{{Text|say|[[Inanis]]|Away with you! The stone's power must be MINE!}}

Kill her:
:{{Text|say|Inanis|At last... I know... my purpose...}}

[[File:Unintended Consequences - Empower Xal'atath.jpg|thumb|The player casting Empower Xal'atath.]]
Upon looting the Void Stone, the player gets an Extra Action Button:
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|Unleash the Void Stone, <name>. It should provide the strength I need to help you find the other two relics.}}
:{{Abilities|Empower Xal'atath|The void stone pulls towards Xal'atath, it seems like it wants to be a part of it.|id=283517|icon=spell_priest_void-blast}}

Upon using Empower Xal'atath, the player lifts Xal'atath and the Void Stone into the air. On completing the cast, Xal'atath flies out of the dagger as a blast of Void energy and takes possession of Inanis' corpse. Now appearing as a translucent void elf, she floats over some distance away.
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath|Yes. YES. It's been so long since I took a mortal form. This body is pleasing... don't you think?}}
:{{Text|say|Xal'atath|I knew you were the right choice, <name>. Your strength and courage are... compelling.}}

Xal'atath's dialogue before turning in:
{{Dialogue|This is an interesting turn of events. I did not know this was possible.}}

And after turning in:
{{Dialogue|Let us hurry. The whispers grow more insistent.}}
