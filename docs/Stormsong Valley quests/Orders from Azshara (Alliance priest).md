==Objectives==
Retrieve Xal'atath and find the Makeshift Altar.
* [[Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire|Xal'atath]] acquired
* Makeshift Altar found
* Xal'atath placed

==Description==
This medallion is inscribed with orders commanding the [[naga]] to invade our shores and seize artifacts of power.

<[[Collector Kojo|Kojo]] studies you thoughtfully.>

I've heard tales of [[Adventurer#Broken Isles|a priest]] who used a horrifying dagger to fight the [[Burning Legion]]. It is said this blade... Xal'atath... whispers secrets of the deep. It might be our best chance of uncovering what the naga seek.

I'm told the naga have an altar on an island in [[Stormsong Valley]]. If you take Xal'atath there, the dagger may reveal crucial information.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<You feel a familiar sensation as Xal'atath reaches out to your mind.

A beguiling blend of dread... and delight.> 

==Progression==
{{The Azsharan Medallion}}
