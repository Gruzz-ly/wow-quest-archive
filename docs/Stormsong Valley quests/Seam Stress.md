<Delormi seems disoriented and grabs your shoulder for support. She presses her hand against her forehead and stands there for a minute.

:{{Text|say|Timeweaver Delormi|Let's hurry, <name>. I fear I haven't much more time and who knows when this hunt will take us next.}}

;On approach

:{{Text|say|Timeweaver Delormi|<Name>! Help me! It was...a trap...}}
:{{Text|say|Timeweaver Delormi|Being torn...apart. Take my thread. Close...the rifts! Gaaaaahh!}}

;Five of six time rifts closed
