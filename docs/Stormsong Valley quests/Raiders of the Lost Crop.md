==Objectives==
Slay 6 Orc Raiders.
* [[Orc Raider (Stormsong Valley)|Orc Raider]] slain (6)

==Description==
I could use a hand here!

So there I was, mindin' my own business and collectin' my harvest when these big galoots show up on their wolves and start torching the town! Luckily I was delivering a sack o' grain, or they'd have caught me and run me down!

I won't stand for having these orcs or their dogs chewing up my fields or my crop.

What do you say, friend? Help a farmer run some looters off his land?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Scare those raiders away before they make off with my whole crop!

==Completion==
Hah, that'll teach them to come here with their pooches and steal our grain!

==Notes==
While passing through the [[Amber Waves]] on the way to [[Briarback Kraul]] and farmers [[Farmer Burton|Burton]] and [[Farmer Goldfield|Goldfield]], keep an eye out for [[Farmer Max]] at {{co|55.0|68.0|Stormsong Valley}}. He offers these quests.

Pick up [[Grain Drain]] before heading out. Nothing fancy; kill orcs and grab sacks of grain.

==Progression==
{{Burton Farmstead}}

==Trivia==
The title of this quest is a reference to the title of the 1981 movie Raiders of the Lost Ark.
