==Objectives==
Acquire a Bundle of Dynamite and use it to kill 16 Warfang Miners and 4 Mine Technicians.
* [[Bundle of Dynamite]] {{co|47.7|38.3|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Warfang Miner]] slain (16)
* [[Mine Technician]] slain (4)

==Description==
We're going to really hit 'em where it hurts, <name>.

They're carting tons of black powder right out of that mine. This could end very badly for all of us if we don't do something.

The mines are relatively undefended, I bet you can get in and wipe out their workers before they realize what's happening.

Keep an eye out for some explosives, if we can use their own tools against them, even better!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
They won't stand a chance!

==Completion==
Sheesh... with all those explosions, I expect there's no one even left alive in that mine.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Grizzled]] and optionally [[WANTED: War Gore]] before heading out.

Head north up the hill to find the [[Clearcut]] and [[Warfang Hold]], and also the rare gryphon [[Whirlwing]], which drops [[Whirlwing's Plumage]].

On a mine cart just outside the mine, find the [[Bundle of Dynamite]]. Loot it, then get to work killing Horde units inside the [[Saltstone Mine]]. Just inside the mine, find [[Holger Nash]], who offers [[Get Out of Here]]. Further inside, a [[Cracked Mine Sweeper]] offers [[The Mine Sweeper]].
