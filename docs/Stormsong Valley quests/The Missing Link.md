==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Tideguard Pontus.jpg|Tideguard Pontus|Our best chance at recovering the cipher.}}
Obtain the Architect's Cipher from [[Tideguard Pontus]].
* [[Architect's Cipher]] {{co|70.2|49.8|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
<Though burned, portions of the note in the architect's hand remain legible.>

They are... everywhere... disguised...

Encrypted... blueprints...

Cipher...

Pontus... watching me...

<The cipher must be needed to read the ship blueprints. It seems Pontus is the likely holder.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We need to get to the bottom of all this before [[Lord Stormsong]] goes on the offensive!

==Completion==
A cipher? Of course! But by the great sea, what's it covered in?!

==Notes==
While on the way to the [[Brineworks]] for [[Rearmament]] and [[Fabricated Fabrications]], locate the corpse of [[Chief Architect Wilson]] just outside of town. He's holding a [[Charred Note]] which starts this quest.

Inside town, loot a dozen Stormfused Weapons, kill [[Shipwright Turncoat]]s, [[Brinebrawn Cannoneer]]s, and [[Stormfused Strikesmith]]s for a [[Warship Blueprint]] or eight, and find and defeat [[Tideguard Pontus]] for the [[Architect's Cipher]].

Watch out for the rare ''elite'' [[Reinforced Hullbreaker]] patrolling town. It is fixed at level 122 with 1.6 million health. However, there is a standard rare elemental on top of the hill just outside of town, [[Galestorm]]. There's also a corrupted pod of dolphins in the river just north of town, comprised of a [[Corrupted Tideskipper]] and three [[Juvenile Tideskipper]]s.

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Tideguard Pontus|All who fail to obey must be culled!}}

At 75%, he sheds his disguise:
:{{text|say|Tideguard Pontus|I am blind no longer.}}
:{{text|say|Tideguard Pontus|Gaze upon the shadow of your demise.}}

Death:
:{{text|say|Tideguard Pontus|They await... in the depths...}}
