==Objectives==
Use the [[Water Bucket (quest item)]] to put out 15 fires around the [[Ruins of Brennadam]].
* Fires doused (15)

==Description==
The [[Horde]] have set fire to my town, <class>. I will make them pay for this.

[[Stormsong Valley]] is the breadbasket of [[Kul Tiras]], and our people need to be fed. The first thing we must do is damage control.

Grab some buckets and help put those fires out!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
My town is still burning, <class>!

==Completion==
Bombs, fire, Horde. Our town will endure it all.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Bombs, Away]] and [[You Have Their Orders]] before heading out. While in the area the Bonus objective [[The Battle for Brennadam]] is also available.

One bucket is just northeast of the quest givers at {{co|58.2|65.7|Stormsong Valley}} on the steps from the water to the dock. There are several more around {{co|55.9|63.2|Stormsong Valley}} near the fountain in the center of the quest area.

==Progression==
{{Brennadam}}
