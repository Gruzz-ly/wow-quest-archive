'''The Azsharan Medallion''' starts from a dropped [[Azsharan Medallion]] from any naga mobs from the world quest [[Naga Attack!]]. The world quest is always up in one of the six {{g|bfa}} zones. This begins the quest chain to unlock the [[Crucible of Storms]] raid.

==Objectives==
Take the Medallion to [[Collector Kojo]].

==Description==
<On the [[naga]]'s body you find an ornate metal disc. The writing on its surface resembles elven script, but you cannot decipher it. You suspect the words are written in the [[Nazja]] tongue.

Perhaps someone with a knowledge of naga artifacts could translate the text.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Glowing Azerite Geode]] (400 [[Azerite (resource)]])
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A medallion, you say? Well, let's have a look at it.

I don't have all day, you know.

;Description
<On the Naga's body you find a circular metal disc. It's writing is in elvish script, but is unfamiliar to you.

You should find someone who can translate the text. It might be important.>
