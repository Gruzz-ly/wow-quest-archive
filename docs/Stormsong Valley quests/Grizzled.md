==Objectives==
Kill Chief Engineer Grizz.
* [[Chief Engineer Grizz]] slain {{co|34.4|39.6|Saltstone Mine}} / {{co|43.3|35.9|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
I saw a particularly ugly and quite agitated [[goblin]] barking orders at the rest of the miners.

I'm willing to bet he's crucial to their entire operation. If you can get into the mine and eliminate him, hopefully it will throw things into disarray.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Tidespeaker Handwraps
|Darkwater Mitts
|Stormchaser Strikers
|Dread Corsair Strikers
|Tidespeaker Slippers
|Darkwater Treads
|Stormchaser Striders
|Dread Corsair Warboots
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Did you find him?

==Completion==
Hopefully his death throws a wrench into their operation.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Having a Blast]] and optionally [[WANTED: War Gore]] before heading out.

On a mine cart just outside the mine, find the [[Bundle of Dynamite]]. Loot it, then get to work killing Horde units inside the [[Saltstone Mine]]. Just inside the mine, find [[Holger Nash]], who offers [[Get Out of Here]]. Further inside, a [[Cracked Mine Sweeper]] offers [[The Mine Sweeper]].

Grizz is on a rise in the big room of the cave. Kill the mech he's riding on, then Grizz hops off.
