==Objectives==
Collect 8 Grazing Battle-Piglets.
* [[Grazing Battle-Piglet]]s captured (8)

==Description==
They look cute enough now, but that's a new herd of battleboars in training.

Farmers don't like waste, and it would be a shame to get rid of such useful creatures.

Either way, we could use those pigs, and I'd rather have them with us rather than face a bloodthirsty one in a few years. You should find them up on top of the cliffs overlooking the center of the kraul. Go round up as many piglets as you can take with you and we'll make good use of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
We can use them for labor, food, and even pets!

==Completion==
I will take these and make sure they get to the farms for proper training.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Run For the Hills]] before heading out. Stay on [[Quilltop]].

While out and about, look for an [[Empty Crate (Stormsong Valley)|Empty Crate]] at {{co|46.3|77.0|Stormsong Valley}} which starts [[Steal Them Back]].

[[Bewildered Battle-Piglet]]s and [[Rooting Battle-Piglet]]s also count.

On completion of both, a brief cutscene tracks down the caves and shows an ettin, [[Bramblefist the Maddened]]. Pick up [[Terror of the Kraul]] to continue.

==Progression==
{{Briarback Kraul}}
