==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Sister Ava.jpg|Sister Ava|Brother Addington's traitorous killer.}}
Seek revenge on Sister Ava.
* [[Sister Ava]] slain

==Description==
This mainspring wasn't altered by an [[engineer]]. These runes on the surface can only have come from a [[tidesage]].

Their aquatic magic is unmistakable. I'd bet whoever did this is also responsible for [[Brother Addington|Addington's]] death.

Whoever they are, they're likely still nearby. Keep an eye out... they won't be hard to find.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Tidespeaker Leggings
|Darkwater Breeches
|Stormchaser Legguards
|Dread Corsair Greaves
|Tidespeaker Sash
|Darkwater Belt
|Stormchaser Belt
|Dread Corsair Girdle
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
This does not bode well.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Lost, Not Forgotten]] and [[Means to an End]] before heading out.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Taelia|I'll scout ahead. Meet you at the shoreline!}}

In the [[Addington Shipyards]], find [[Samuel Williams]]:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Those laborers... they're being held by tidesage magic! We must help them.}}

Samuel offers [[Forced Labor]]. Quickly pick it up and turn in to get [[Bound and Oppressed]].

[[Sister Ava]] can be found on deck of the ship in the middle of the shipyard.

On approach:
:{{text|say|Sister Ava|Our master beneath the tides will guide us all to victory!}}

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Sister Ava|House Stormsong will rule this land!}}

At 60%:
:{{text|say|Sister Ava|You will kneel before your queen, peasant!}}

At 30%:
:{{text|say|Sister Ava|I'll have you drawn and quartered for that!}}

Death:
:{{text|say|Sister Ava|She will... take you... too...}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|I know not what darkness took your mind, sister, but it will torment our people no longer.}}

{{A House in Peril}}
