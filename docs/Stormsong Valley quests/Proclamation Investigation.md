==Objectives==
Read 3 Stormsong Proclamations.
* [[Stormsong Proclamation]]s read (3)

==Description==
My lord seldom leaves our holdings along the northern coast, and visitors are expressly forbidden. For most, [[tidesages]] like myself are their only connection to the house proper.

[[Lord Stormsong]] usually delivers orders through proclamations posted throughout the valley. None have reached [[Brennadam]], but if there are any posted here we may be able to find some answers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Lord Stormsong is a bit aloof, but his power over the tides is beyond measure.

==Completion==
Independence?!

This is too far. A shattered [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]] will never stand!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Do what you can, <name>. I must tend to my brother.}}

Pick up [[Unnecessary Duress]] and [[Haywire Harvesters]] before heading out.

Just east of the quest givers is a rare mob, [[Foreman Scripps]].

First proclamation:
:{{text|say|Lord Stormsong|Children of the sea, today is the dawn of a new age for us all.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Stormsong|[[House Stormsong]] must take control of this shattered kingdom and restore it to glory!}}

Second proclamation:
:{{text|say|Lord Stormsong|No more will we work our fields and build our ships for the haughty Boralus elite to give nothing in return.}}
:{{text|say|Lord Stormsong|We must work as one and muster our strength. [[Kul Tiras]] will forever belong to its people!}}

Third proclamation:
:{{text|say|Lord Stormsong|Our mighty tidesages shall gather us all to victory with the very power of the sea itself!}}
:{{text|say|Lord Stormsong|Together we shall return to the tides. Together, we shall be powerful once again!}}

On return:
:''Pike has gotten Addington off the hook.''
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|You were too good for this world, brother. I will make sure you receive a proper burial.}}
