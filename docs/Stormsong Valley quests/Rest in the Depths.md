==Objectives==
Complete the Ritual of Release.
*[[Soul]]s released
*[[Dead Ringer (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
This passage flows through the [[Shrine of the Storm]] out into the open sea. We will release the souls of the fallen here.

Legends say that as our spirits pass through the Shrine, they aid in the great blessing rituals that all Kul Tiran ships undergo. 

In that way, we Stormsong never stop serving our people.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]
* +10 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
The sea demands respect. To cross it is to invite its wrath upon us all.

==Completion==
Thank you for aiding me in my solemn task.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''The body of [[Brother Addington]] is floating in front of Brother Pike.''
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|When you are ready, release the souls within the bell.}}

Use the quest item:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Hear our call, fallen. Your wicked deeds are forgiven this day.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Return to the storm and know peace. Flow through the Shrine so we might share your strength.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|It is done.}}
:''The souls of [[Stormsong Marshal]]s, [[Stormsong Loyalist]]s, and Brother Addington appear and go into the sea.''

The quest chain continues with [[Rearmament]] and [[Fabricated Fabrications]], but there are also breadcrumbs to other quest chains in the area. [[Hobbs]] starts [[The Days Are Just Packed]], and a [[Help Wanted]] poster starts [[Make it Mildenhall]].

==Progression==
{{A House in Peril}}
