==Objectives==
Deliver the [[:Cracked Mine Sweeper]] to [[Felecia Gladstone]] just outside the [[Saltstone Mine]].

==Description==
<One of the goblin flamethrowers. Unfortunately the tank has been cracked. It would be a good idea to bring it back to Felecia, she might have something to fix it up.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
A flamethrower!? This could be quite useful, but why couldn't you find one in better shape?

==Notes==
In the [[Saltstone Mine]] for [[Having a Blast]], [[Grizzled]] and [[Get Out of Here]], find a [[Cracked Mine Sweeper]], which offers this quest.

==Progression==
{{Cycle of Hatred}}
