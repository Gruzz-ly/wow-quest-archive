==Objectives==
Use the [[Piloted Farmhand]] to slay 30 enemies.
* Enemies slain (30)

==Description==
The plants have gone amok since you defeated their masters! Don't worry though, I've got a plan.

I've been busy fixing up one of the farmhands that didn't go completely haywire. It should have enough juice for one more trip through the fields.

We've got some serious [[technology]] in these [[Harvest golem|harvesters]]. Their tools should be more than enough to take care of some small plants and even a couple [[quilboar]].

What do you say? You up for some farming the Stormsong way? Hop on in and get to work!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Vineshaper's Grasp
|Darkwater Bracers
|Tidespeaker Cuffs
|Stormchaser Bracers
|Dread Corsair Bracers
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Take out as many of them as you can!

==Completion==
Yeah, that'll show them! Those quilboar will think twice before invading my farm again!

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Repaired Farmhand]] next to Burton. It has two abilities:
#{{Abilities|Harvest Crops|Inflicts 56,215 Physical damage to all enemies in front of the caster.|cd=1.5 sec|notes=Instant|id=196317|icon=ability_xavius_tormentingswipe}}
#{{Abilities|Hammer Smash|cd=5 sec|Stuns all enemies within 10 yards, rendering them unable to move or attack for 5 sec. Inflicts 13,789 Physical damage to enemies within 10 yards.|notes=Instant|id=272188|icon=ability_thunderclap}}

While in the vehicle is a great time to complete the bonus objective [[Weed Whacking]]!
