==Objectives==
Retrieve [[Brother Addington|Brother Addington's]] Tidal Kris, Abyssal Beacon, and Wavecaller's Mantle.
* [[:Tidal Kris]] {{co|63.3|59.5|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[:Abyssal Beacon (quest item)]] {{co|64.8|57.9|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Wavecaller's Mantle]] {{co|66.9|60.6|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
In our haste to journey here I did not think to bring my ritual implements we [[tidesage]]s use to augment our power.

To be honest, I had never expected them necessary on what should have been a peaceful sojourn.

Addington does not have his, either. I am sure the militia took him from his home before he had the chance to react.

That means his implements should still be in the yard somewhere. We must find them before my power is of much real use.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
We must find a full set of ritual implements. I fear we will have need of them.

==Completion==
Those initiates were nowhere near ready to wield our sacred implements. They are far better served in our hands.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Lost, Not Forgotten]] and [[The Rising Tide]] before heading out.

On accept of both of Pike's quests:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Let us see this done.}}
:''Pike rises from his knees, Addington in his arms.''

In the [[Addington Shipyards]], find [[Samuel Williams]]:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Those laborers... they're being held by tidesage magic! We must help them.}}

Samuel offers [[Forced Labor]]. Quickly pick it up and turn in to get [[Bound and Oppressed]].

Find the [[Wavecaller's Mantle]] near [[Initiate Evans]]:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|A bit waterlogged, but still legible. These incantations will serve us well.}}

The [[:Tidal Kris]] is guarded by [[Initiate Clarke]]:
:{{text|say|Initiate Clarke|How can... this be...}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Good, this blade is still sharp. A sharp blade is a safe one.}}

The [[:Abyssal Beacon (quest item)]] is guarded by [[Initiate Wright]]:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|The ocean's mists hide much, but this beacon shall let us reach them.}}

On completion of both of Pike's quests:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|I will prepare the ritual to release these souls. Meet me by the shoreline just north of here.}}

==Progression==
