==Objectives==
Join [[Brother Pike]] outside [[Sagehold]].

==Description==
Not all of [[House Stormsong]] have followed my [[Lord Stormsong|Lord]] down this dark path. They know not - I knew not - the truth of his depravity.

Sagehold looms above us. It is where all tidesages study to wield the sea's power.

We will build upon the Storm's Wake and make my shattered home whole once more. We will save all who are willing. 

The rest will perish.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,650 [[XP]]

==Completion==
With any luck we will end this matter here.

:{{text|say|Samuel Williams|I'm so cold. Will the voices stop soon?}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Yes, Samuel. Just stay strong.}}
