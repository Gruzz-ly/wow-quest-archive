==Completion==
*{{Alliance}} {{text|say|Sergeant Calvin|Great stuff! You certainly nipped their plans in the bud.}}

==Notes==
*Location: [[Burton Farmstead]], [[Stormsong Valley]].
* Although the quest states that you need to use the [[Repaired Farmhand]] to do the quest, this is apparently a mistake or bug that was never fixed. The player need to kill the mobs the normal way.
*To fill up the bar, kill [[Briarback Kraultender]], [[Grasping Thorns]], and [[Briarback Skirmisher]]s, and interact with [[Vine-Wrapped Farmer]]s and [[Bramble Pod]]s.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.0.1|note=Added.}}
