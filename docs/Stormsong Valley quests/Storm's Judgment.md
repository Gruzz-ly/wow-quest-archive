==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Wavespeaker Reid.jpg|Wavespeaker Reid|Powerful member of the Tidesage Council.}}
Confront [[Wavespeaker Reid]].
* Speak to [[Brother Pike]] {{co|69.3|58.7|Stormsong Valley}}
* Wavespeaker Reid confronted

==Description==
When I opened my mind to the currents during the ritual, I felt the presence of a member of [[Lord Stormsong]]'s innermost circle.

Wavespeaker Reid. If anyone can locate the missing fleet, it is him.

I will not stand by while my brothers move against our own people. Oaths be damned.

We must force Reid to see reason.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|38|80|}}
*[[Small Azerite Shard]] (125x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]
*Choice of Azerite armor
**[[Darkwater Tunic]]
**[[Darkwater Shoulderguards]]

==Progress==
This must be done.

==Completion==
I never thought Reid would succumb to darkness. Things are worse than I feared.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|I feel Reid's power calling out like a beacon. Quickly!}}
:''Pike teleports away.''

Head east-southeast to [[Layson & Sons Rigging]] to find Pike:
:{{gossip|I'm ready.}}
:{{text|yell|Brother Pike|Reid! The fleet must be returned to Kul Tiras at once!}}
:{{text|say|Wavespeaker Reid|The tides shift, Brother. If you do not stand with us, then you are lost.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|It is you who are lost!}}

Reid has a Storm Barrier and spawns [[Risen Tide]]s and [[Bound Squall]]s. Defeat them:
:{{text|say|Wavespeaker Reid|You were always too weak to serve by Lord Stormsong's side, languishing in Brennadam like a fool.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|We swore to protect Brennadam. To protect our people! Have you forgotten our oaths?}}

Some more mobs:
:{{text|say|Wavespeaker Reid|Can you not feel the great one deep below? By her will, we shall be whole once more!}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|Those voices offer only lies!}}

Defeat them, and Reid will knock Pike away and summon an [[Immerseus]]-style water elemental, [[Riptide (Stormsong Valley)|Riptide]].
:{{text|say|Wavespeaker Reid|I bore of this prattle.}}
:''Reid casts a spell that moves Pike a bit and incapacitates him.''
:{{text|say|Wavespeaker Reid|I have much to prepare. Deal with them.}}
:''Reid teleports away.''

Defeat Riptide, then return to Pike at [[Seafarer's Rest]]:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|[[Tidemother]]... what have we become?}}

This concludes the "A House in Peril" chapter of the [[Stormsong Valley storyline]]. The quest chain continues with [[Voices Below]].
