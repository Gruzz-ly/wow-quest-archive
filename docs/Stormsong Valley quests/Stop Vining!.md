==Objectives==
Slay the three Vinemasters.
* [[Vinemaster Guff]] slain {{co|48.2|62.4|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Vinemaster Orgsteen]] slain {{co|46.2|64.5|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Vinemaster Smagh]] slain {{co|47.9|67.2|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
You may have noticed that the fields are a little... unstable right now.

The [[Briarback]] have been busy, growing those large bramble vines and boring tunnels underneath the farm. The vines have always been an important part of their borders, and they're expanding!

Go down into the lower area and see if you can find who or what is making those vines grow. There's no way that they're growing like that naturally. If we can stop the vines we can retake this area!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Have you found those mystics yet? These vines are growing like crazy!

==Completion==
Mystics using magic to shape the vines? I don't know much about magic, but I'm glad you stopped them.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Gadgets and Gizmos Aplenty]] before heading out.

Additionally, the bonus objective [[Weed Whacking]] is available while in the [[Burton Farmstead]]. Don't focus on it right now -- save it to complete during [[Farming Stimulator]].

While in the caves, look for rare quilboar [[Captain Razorspine]] at {{co|47.3|65.7|Stormsong Valley}}.
