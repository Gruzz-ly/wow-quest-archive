==Objectives==
Travel to the location marked on your map and investigate the shrine in [[Stormsong Valley]]. Do what you can to repair the shrine, should the need arise.

==Description==
Yes, I believe there are a few here in [[Kul Tiras]]. You should visit them, <name>, investigate them. See if what this book says is true.

This particular shrine he mentions sounds like it may reside near [[Brennadam]], in Stormsong Valley.

It should be fairly easy to find. If my calculations are correct, it should be just north of that town.

Here are the notes on that one. And I've marked its location for you on your map. Good luck, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Upon your investigation you discover that the shrine has a couple locations where jewels appeared to have been located, but no longer exist.

Additionally, the center jewel appears to have several cracks in it as well.>

==Notes==
