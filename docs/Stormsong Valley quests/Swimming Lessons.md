==Objectives==
Collect the three scrolls.
* [[Scroll of Endless Tides]] {{co|38.7|39.3|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Scroll of Graceful Breaths]] {{co|34.4|36.4|Stormsong Valley}}
* [[Scroll of Harmonious Fins]] {{co|38.7|44.6|Stormsong Valley}}

==Description==
For millennia we have roamed [[Azeroth|Azeroth's]] depths, yet never has a land walker journeyed with us. In order to help us, you must learn to travel the waters as we do.

The three scrolls of the sea shall grant you the energies to travel and survive underwater as we do.

Bring me the Scrolls of Harmonious Fins, Endless Tides and Graceful Breaths.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]
* +75 reputation with [[Tortollan Seekers]]

==Progress==
You must collect the Scroll of Harmonious Fins, Endless Tides and Graceful Breaths.

==Completion==
These will do nicely. Just as we are, you shall now be one with the sea.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Cleaning Bills]] and [[Don't Play with Matches]] before heading out.

Start killing a path north along the coast, cleaning bills (while mounted!) and finding scrolls along the way. The last scroll is out west north of [[Fort Daelin]].

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Scrollsage Nola|With these three scrolls, I can make it easier for you to travel here.}}
