The Horde is up to something and we're gonna find out what, one way or another. <!-- what is this supposed to be? -->

==Objectives==
Assist injured [[Spy|spies]] in [[Stormsong Valley]].
* [[Injured Operative|Injured spies]] healed (5)

==Description==
When [[Mathias Shaw|Shaw]] and I got here we discovered most of our operatives were dead. Most, but not all.

Go into the field and get any of our operatives out of there. They might have more intel on what the [[Horde]] are planning here in [[Warfang Hold]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find our missing operatives?

==Completion==
Our people stumbled onto something really big out here!

*{{text|say|Injured Operative|I overheard some [[peon]]s talking. They say the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Warchief]] ordered the area cleared. Stay on guard.}}
*{{text|say|Injured Operative|I saw Kelsey Steelspark run by a little bit ago, but was too wounded to get her attention. She might need help, too.}}
