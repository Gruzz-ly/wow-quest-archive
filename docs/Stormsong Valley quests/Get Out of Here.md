==Objectives==
Free 6 Captured Miners.
* [[Captured Miner]] freed (6)

==Description==
I can't believe you're here, please, we need help!

They've been forcing us to mine non-stop, the weakest among us have been steadily dropping. At this rate, we'll all be dead soon.

The chains are weak, you may be able to pry the lock apart.

I'll keep a lookout until the others are free, don't worry about me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Did you free everyone?

==Completion==
Thank you for rescuing us, we'd have been trapped in here until we all slowly perished.

==Notes==
In the [[Saltstone Mine]] for [[Having a Blast]] & [[Grizzled]], find [[Holger Nash]] just inside, offering this quest. Further inside, a [[Cracked Mine Sweeper]] offers [[The Mine Sweeper]].
