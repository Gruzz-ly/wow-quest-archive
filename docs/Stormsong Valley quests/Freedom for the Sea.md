==Objectives==
Slay 6 Bound Seasurges.
* [[Bound Seasurge]] slain (6)

==Description==
The [[naga]] along this coast appear to be trying to push the shoreline up the hill here. We've been able to keep them back at the beach so far, but they've been binding more [[elemental]]s than we can keep up with.

Without a [[Tidesages|tidesage]], we have no way to free the elementals from their bindings, but we cannot allow them to push forward anymore. The [[Elemental spirit|spirit of the sea]] should not be contained by anything. Slay them, and let them return to the ocean.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
For a people that live in the sea, the naga seem to have little respect for it.

==Completion==
That should slow down their progress quite a bit. You have my gratitude.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Freedom for the Sea]] and [[A Bit of a Bind]] and [[Caught in the Net]] before heading out.

Kill a path southward, simply killing [[Bound Seasurge]]s, looting naga for [[Fishbone Key]]s to open [[Naga Cage]]s and free villagers, and finding [[Binder Sa'thress]] at the south end of the beach before it turns west.

==Progression==
{{From the Depths}}
