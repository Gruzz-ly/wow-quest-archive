==Objectives==
Talk to [[Hank Harrison]] in [[Brennadam]].

==Description==
The mission at Brennadam was a success. Well done, <name>.

We now have access to what's rumored to be a very fast [[Harvester]] that you are able to ride. Sounds strange to me, but what do I know?

Travel to Brennadam and enquire about this upgrade.

==Completion==
Well, sure, it don't look like much but hooo-boy when it goes it really goes!

Want to take it for a spin?
