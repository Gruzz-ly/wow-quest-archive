==Objectives==
Find an intact Zeth'jir Channeling Rod.
* [[Zeth'jir Channeling Rod]]

==Description==
I've been talking with [[Rikal]], and the [[tortollan]] says that our problem in the delta can probably be solved by turning the naga's magic back on them.

A few of the sorceresses on the south coast have a channeling wand that we may be able to use to break the head priestesses' ritual channeling. Find one, and bring it back here.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fort Daelin Lantern
|Tidespeaker Legwarmers
|Darkwater Pants
|Stormchaser Leggings
|Dread Corsair Legguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
We cannot allow this fort to fall!

==Completion==
Even I can feel how much power this thing contains.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Any Ammo Will Do]] and [[Problem Solving with Gunpowder]] before heading out. Exit to the west.

Harpoons are stuck in walls and found in the corpses of [[Shoalbreach Lance]]s. Live Explosive Traps can be set all over the quest area. Kill [[Zeth'jir Seacaller]]s until the channeling rod drops.

==Progression==
{{From the Depths}}
