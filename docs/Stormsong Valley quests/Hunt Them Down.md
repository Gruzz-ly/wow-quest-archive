{{questportrait|Captain Ara.jpg|Captain Ara|Without her leadership, the Kul Tiran attack should crumble.}}
==Objectives==
Slay Captain Ara and 8 Storm's Wake Footmen.
* [[Captain Ara]] slain
* [[Storm's Wake Footman]] slain (8)

==Description==
These [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]], they don't seem normal. [[Human]]s can be a cruel bunch from what I've heard, but these ones seem to take pleasure in slaying the fallen. 

The worst of them was a woman wearing a peculiar mask. She seemed to be shouting orders to the others, so I guess she's their leader.

Honor the fallen and ensure they and their leader don't survive.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Without their leader, the Kul Tirans' morale will be easy to break.

==Completion==
You've done us a great service, <name>.

==Notes==
