==Objectives==
Question [[Brother Alen]] for information about the missing fleet.
* Brother Alen questioned {{co|68.4|81.5|Boralus}}
* Follow Brother Alen into the [[Monastery Archives|Archives]] {{co|73.7|39.5|Boralus}}
* [[Lieutenant Wade]] slain {{co|73.7|39.5|Boralus}}
* Secret learned {{co|73.7|39.5|Boralus}}

==Description==
It seems like this Brother Alen we keep hearing about might have some answers. 

At least, I sure hope so. Everyone here seems a bit... evasive.

I think I saw some archivists heading into the southern cloister. If we follow them, I bet we'll find Alen too.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 20,560 [[XP]]
* +150 reputation with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Completion==
I'd rather not stick around to see if he's right.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Taelia|The [[tidesages]] have some of the most complete libraries in the [[Azeroth|world]]. I bet we'll find our archivist there.}}

Enter the library:
:{{text|say|Brother Alen|Do not delay. Lord Stormsong needs these charts at the [[Shrine of the Storm]] at once!}}

Speak with him:
:Ah, welcome. Visitors are becoming rare these days, especially in the archives.
:How may I help you?
:{{gossip|Can you tell me anything about the missing fleet?}}
:{{text|say|Brother Alen|Follow me. Eyes down.}}
:''Alen passes a tidemapper.''
:{{text|say|Boralus Tidemapper|Outsiders are forbidden in the archives, Brother.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Alen|Back to your work. They're with me.}}
:''Alen reaches Lieutenant Wade and the entrance to the archives.''
:{{text|say|Brother Alen|Bar all visitors. I have guests.}}
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Wade|Yes, Brother.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Alen|This way.}}
:''Alen heads downstairs into the [[Monastery Archives]].''
:{{text|say|Brother Alen|You have no idea of the danger you are in here.}}
:{{text|say|Taelia|What do you mean, "danger"?}}
:{{text|say|Brother Alen|The fleet is not lost. It is being held prisoner in an unnatural storm.}}
:''Wade runs downstairs and starts attacking the adventurer. Alen cowers in fear.''
:{{text|say|Lieutenant Wade|[[Heretic]]! You will not interfere!}}

Defeat her:
:{{text|say|Lieztenant Wade|I was only... following orders...}}
:{{text|say|Brother Alen|Are you all right? I should have known better than to think Wade above the shadow that has taken House Stormsong.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Alen|Our people follow a dark path. But there are those among us who have sown the seeds of resistance.}}
:''Alen hands the adventurer a [[Stormwake Pendant]].''
:{{text|say|Brother Alen|Find [[Brother Pike]] in [[Brennadam]]. Give him this pendant. Our work is just beginning, and he will need your help.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Alen|Now leave, while you still can! The others have surely caught on to your efforts.}}

Turn in to Taelia.
