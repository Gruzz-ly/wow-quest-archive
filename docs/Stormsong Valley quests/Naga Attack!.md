'''Naga Attack!''' is a [[world quest]] that is always up in one of the six zones in [[Kul Tiras]] and [[Zandalar]]. Notably, [[naga]] attackers drop the [[Azsharan Medallion]] while on this world quest, which starts another quest line that awards the [[Gift of N'Zoth]] buff and/or the [[Twitching Eyeball]] toy.

*Repel the [[naga]] invaders
