==Objectives==
Kill 6 [[Briarback tribe|Briarback]] Lookouts.
* [[Briarback Lookout]]s slain (6)
* [[Sedative Quill (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Some of these [[quilboar]] are clearly lookouts. Those horns make it obvious, almost like I could see their task floating above their heads.

I was able to kill one, but not before he blew that horn of his and summoned backup. I suggest you keep them silent before they do the same with you.

If we're going to get anywhere in there, you'll need to do it quietly. Here, [[Hobbs]] gave me a few of his sleeping darts. That should keep them quiet.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Storm's Wake]]

==Progress==
Don't let them sound the alarms!

==Completion==
I'm amazed I made it here. This place is so heavily guarded...

==Notes==
Pick up [[Boaring Company]] before heading out.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Sergeant Calvin|I'll go on ahead and search for the farmers. Whatever you do, don't get captured!}}
:{{text|say|Mayor Roz|We are going to make sure that the quilboar can never wage war at this scale again.}}

Head up the hill to find the marked cave at {{co|42.4|67.4|Stormsong Valley}} to enter the [[Briarback Kraul]].

Kill a lookout to start [[Anger in a Bottle]] from the dropped [[Foul-Smelling Flask]]. Additionally, just a bit further inside is the [[Brambleguard Totem]], which starts [[Totems, Totems, Totems!]]

==Progression==
{{Briarback Kraul}}
