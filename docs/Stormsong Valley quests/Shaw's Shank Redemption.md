==Objectives==
Find Mathias Shaw in The [[Screaming Pit]] above [[Warfang Hold]].
* Find [[Mathias Shaw]]
* [[Giles Deathstrike]] slain
* Follow Shaw

==Description==
Hmm. Shaw said he'd check in when we got communications back but he hasn't. He's probably run into the same trouble the rest of our [[Spy|spies]] did.

I'll stay here and guard the listening post. You find Shaw. He was headed for the cliff above Warfang Hold near the top of the waterfall. The [[peon]]s called that area "The Screaming Pit" for some reason. I bet it's a real pleasant place.

Stab whatever he's fighting for me, okay?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Just in time, <name>.

==Completion==
They've increased security here beyond anything we expected, and with good reason.

==Notes and trivia==
Follow the worn path past the [[Saltstone Mine]] to the top of the small waterfall, where you'll find a low cave entrance. Inside, Shaw is fighting a [[forsaken]] named Giles Deathstrike.
