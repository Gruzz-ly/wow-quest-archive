==Objectives==
Search Seawatch Point for survivors.
* [[Landing Craft|Landing craft]] boarded (Optional)
* [[Seawatch Point]] [[Huelo|investigated]]

==Description==
Looks like the [[magic]] the [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tirans]] used on our [[ship]]s is beginning to dissipate, but I'm sure what happened to our ships here is only just the beginning.

Get to the shore. We need to contact the survivors and find out just what we're up against.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you, friend.

These [[human]]s have made a grave error today.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|say|High Warlord Cromush|Use one of those ropes to scurry down to a landing craft... unless you prefer swimming.}}

You can click on a Rope Coil to get inland.

:{{Text|say|[[Sanya Wraithschilde]]|<Name>! Thank the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]] you're here! Rexxar diverted a bunch of those Kul Tirans off into the buildings ahead. He needs backup!}}

;Interacting with [[Huelo]]
:<The creature weakly looks at you for a moment before turning its gaze to the harpoon sticking within its side.>

:{{Text|yell|Storm's Wake Man-at-Arms|Hah! Caught another one!}}
:{{Text|say|Storm's Wake Man-at-Arms|Look at it squirm in the net! I'm gonna have fun gutting this one!}}
:{{Text|yell|Rexxar|For the Horde!}}
:{{Text|say|Rexxar|His heart grows weak... there is nothing more I can do for him but to end his suffering.}}
:''Rexxar mercy-kills Huelo.'' 
:{{Text|say|Rexxar|Blood and thunder, my friend.}}

;Rexxar
:It seems we have another war to fight.

:There is little time for chatter.
