==Objectives==
Go to [[Stormsong Valley|Stormsong]] and speak with [[Brother Pike]] at [[Kraken's Reach]].

==Description==
<[[Katherine Proudmoore|Lady Katherine's]] jaw sets.>

I refuse to believe I am too late.

No one has ever come back from [[Fate's End]], but if anyone could survive I have to believe it would be my [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]].

Go to Stormsong Valley and secure transit to Fate's End from the [[tidesage]]s. Brother Pike is a good place to start.

Hurry, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
*[[Glowing Azerite Crystal]] (250x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 1,790 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Jaina Proudmoore was sent to Fate's End and her mother wishes to save her?

Then we must act at once if we are to have any hope of saving her life!

==Notes==
