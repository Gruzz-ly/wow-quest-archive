==Objectives==
Collected motes of Stormsurge from defeated elementals.
* Stormsurge gathered (6)
* [[Staff of Storms]] (provided)

==Description==
The ritual I must conduct is written on a scroll. To gain access to it, you'll have to break through the dark energies the fallen tidesages have placed around it, with the power of the storm.

This relic can be used to pull purified power from the enslaved elementals. Not only will you be gaining the means to our end, you will ultimately be freeing these spirits from corruption.

Defeat the enslaved elementals and then call their power into the relic.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* [[Glowing Azerite Crystal]] (250x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The essence contained in the staff is wild, but pure and uncorrupted.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. The staff is now imbued with the strength of those elementals. You will need it for what lies ahead.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|You must gather what I require quickly. A life is at stake.}}
:{{text|say|Brother Pike|I will begin preparations. Meet me once you have collected what we need.}}

The best way is to fly to Shrine of the Storm's flight point (where you'll be turning in the quests), go down until you reach the mobs for [[Ritual Effects]] and gather those items first, as they usually have elementals as combat pets. You will likely have to kill at least two. Remember to use the staff by the corpse to get the motes. On the way back up, look for the four lone elementals you can kill.
