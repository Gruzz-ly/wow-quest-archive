==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Enchanting Siren.jpg|Enchanting Siren|She is one of theirs now, their wretched queen!}}
Kill the Enchanting Siren.
* [[Enchanting Siren]] slain

==Description==
A long time ago, there was a maiden.

A precocious child fond of song, she made it her hobby to shadow my every move. Charming at first.

Walking on the pier's edge, she became entangled within the ropes surrounding a leering idol. At that time a tremor ran through the waves, giving the small push needed to send them both beneath the surface.

I can hear her song still. At first I thought it a passing fancy, music upon the waves. I realize now the voice comes with sinister purpose.

She must die.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,310 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I always wondered what became of the little waif?

==Completion==
She was made their queen, and their slave.

==Notes==
For a change, things are quite straightforward. Go up the road to the [[Precipice of Oblivion]] and the Enchanting Siren is at the overlook.
