==Objectives==
Use the [[Water of Vision (Highmountain)|Water of Vision]] to walk in the memories of [[Igrul the Scalebane]].
* Water of Vision used
* [[Shadow Lurker]] slain (8)
* [[Shadow of Uul]] slain (15)
* Bitestone Ward placed

==Description==
[[Spiritwalker]]s maintain balance between the world of the living and the [[Veil|spirit realm]]. We can travel into the memories of the dead to glean clues about the past.

The wards [[Ebonhorn]] maintained were placed long ago by heroes who fought the darkness. By walking in their footsteps, we may locate the wards and restore them.

Igrul, the [[drogbar]] known as the Scalebane, was a true friend to [[Huln Highmountain]]. Use the Water of Vision to enter his memories and find where he placed the first ward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
As a spiritwalker, I am able to see the memories of the dead.

==Completion==
I am pleased you were able to place the first ward. We are one step closer to saving Ebonhorn.

But this mention of the [[Uul'gyneth|Darkness]] is unsettling. It is a monster spoken of in our myths and folklore, tales told around campfires to spook the young.

Could these stories be based in truth?

==Notes==
:{{Text|say|Igrul the Scalebane|This ward will help seal away a great evil. So long as I draw breath, the Darkness will never be free!}}

A corpse of a [[Necrodark Defiler]] is present by the Bitestone Ward.

==Progression==
{{Highmountain Horde}}
