==Objectives==
Mine for leystone 35 times while using Ronos's Glass Pick.
* [[Glass-Extracted Leystone]] (35)
* [[Ronos' Pick]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Leystone Ore|Leystone]] is a sensitive ore. Our smiths can coax great power out of it, but as miners, we must treat it with respect, or else its power will retreat inward.

<The [[tauren]] hands you what appears to be a GLASS [[mining pick]].>

The next time you mine some leystone ore, use this pick. It will break if you strike too hard. THIS is the respect that leystone requires.

==Rewards==
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You haven't broken my pick, have you?

==Completion==
You've learned much, <name>.

Stay a while. I have a story for you.

==Notes==
It is not required to use Ronos' Pick specifically, regular mining from nodes and mobs grants Glass-Extracted Leystones.
