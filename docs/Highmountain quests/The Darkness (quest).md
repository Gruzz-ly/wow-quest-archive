==Objectives==
Defeat [[Uul'gyneth]] the Darkness.
*Uul'gyneth slain

==Description==
For thousands of years, the Darkness was held at bay. The wards stood... protecting [[Highmountain]].

Now they are gone, and evil is free once more.

The Darkness that haunted our dreams... that even the [[kobold]]s spoke of only in frightened whispers... has come.

Uul'gyneth, herald of the [[Old God]]s, paves the way for his masters. Unless we stand together and defeat him, all is lost.

You must hold nothing back, champion. None of us can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
I cannot put into words how much you have done for us this day, or how grateful I am to have you as an ally.

You have our thanks, hero. You have MY thanks.

I owe you a great debt for this.

==Notes==
:{{Text|say|Uul'gyneth|This mountain belongs to us, mortals. You will soon become vessels for this world's true power!}}

Ebyssian, Baine, and Mayla fight the Darkness. Baine throws his [[Baine's Totem|totems]].

:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|These heroes do not stand alone.}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|Together, we will banish your darkness!}}
:{{Text|say|Uul'gyneth|You will serve us, dragon, just as Neltharion did! Your kind always bends to the whispers.}}

;The Darkness defeated
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I did not realize that I had invited a dragon to feast with us at Thunder Bluff. Had I known, I might have set a bigger table!}}
:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|Only Mayla and our champion knew my secret before. Now I entrust it to you as well, chieftain.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|I see no reason for anyone else to know, spiritwalker. Let it be a matter kept… between friends.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Mayla Highmountain|Today was very nearly a dark day for Azeroth.}}
:{{Text|say|Mayla Highmountain|Had Uul'gyneth's plan succeeded, we all would have been made into servants of the Old Gods… including Ebonhorn.}}
:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|I shudder at the thought, Mayla. Without the swift action of Baine and this champion, all would have been lost.}}
:{{Text|say|Mayla Highmountain|Baine Bloodhoof, you have demonstrated courage, honor, and loyalty. I believe it is time for your people and mine to renew our bonds of kinship.}}
:{{Text|say|Mayla Highmountain|If you will have us, the tauren of Highmountain would be proud to join your Horde.}}
:{{Text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|The Horde will be honored to welcome you! Let us travel to Orgrimmar and share the good news with our Warchief.}}
