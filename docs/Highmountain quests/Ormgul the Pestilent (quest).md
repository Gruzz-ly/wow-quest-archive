==Objectives==
Slay [[Ormgul the Pestilent]] and acquire his Bug Sprayer.
* [[Bug Sprayer]]

==Description==
We've lived at peace with the [[drogbar]] for years--our tribe even more than the others. But we were betrayed in our last trade with them at [[Riverbend]].

They usually supply us with potent alchemy to prevent insects from infesting our fields. This time, led by Ormgul, they have attacked the crops that sustain us all.

Ormgul the Pestilent is the one who brought the infection to our farmland. Destroy him, and bring me whatever he uses to attract the bugs to our land.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Snowblind Treads
|Drogstitch Footwraps
|Whitewater Sabatons
|Thunderpeak Warboots
|Ormgul's Bug Sprayer
|Poison-Resistant Pumpkin

}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 101)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
The [[Rivermane tribe|Rivermane]] are a peaceful tribe. We provide the others with food and healing in exchange for protection and equipment.

When pressed, however, I am willing to put my magic to more violent use.

==Completion==
Now we have what they used to spray our fields. I wonder what use we could put this to...
