==Progress==
The drogbar used to control only earthen magic, but it seems they've found a way to draw power from other sources.

==Completion==
I have never seen a drogbar transform like that. The [[:Hammer of Khaz'goroth]] is indeed powerful.

==Notes==
When Gelmogg reaches 50% health, both he and his attackers become petrified as [[Dargrul]] himself appears with the [[Hammer of Khaz'goroth]], which he then uses to transform Gelmogg into a crystalline [[earth elemental|earth fury]] before running off.

:{{text|yell|Dargrul|Perhaps I misjudged your worth...}}
:{{text|yell|Dargrul|When you're done with this distraction, meet us in [[Riverbend]].}}
:''A [[Water Elemental (Highmountain)|Water Elemental]] and [[Rivermane Tauren]] also appear.''

Completing the quest awards "The Rivermane Tribe" criterion of [[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]].
