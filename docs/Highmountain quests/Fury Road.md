;Gossip
I have stolen a gem of power from one of the Underking's lackies.

Use this gem and you will have a crystal fury at your command.

I ask that you use it to recover more crystals from within the Crystal Fissure. With those crystals, I and my tribe can better aid Thunder Totem in its... whatever it does.

Do we have a deal?

{{Gossip|Give me the crystal.}}
