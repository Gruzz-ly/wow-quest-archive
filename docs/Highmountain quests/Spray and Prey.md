==Objectives==
Use the Bug Sprayer on drogbar in [[Whitewater Wash]].
* [[Drogbar]] sprayed (6)
* [[Bug Sprayer (usable)]] (provided)

==Description==
The Bug Sprayer you recovered from [[Ormgul the Pestilent]] seems like it could give us an advantage against the drogbar and their insects.

Spray the Drogbar with their own alchemy and watch their insects turn against them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Snowblind Gloves
|Drogstitch Grips
|Whitewater Gloves
|Thunderpeak Handguards
|Snowblind Raiment
|Drogstitch Tunic

}}

You will also receive:
{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
For this group of drogbar to turn against us after so many years of peace...

==Completion==
That worked quite well. I will hold on to this Bug Sprayer; it might be useful in the battles to come.

==Notes==
Get within range and spray [[Drogbar Wormhook]]s and [[Drogbar Rivertroller]]s. The [[Diseased Grub]]s and [[Infectious Worm]]s will help kill the target.

==Progression==
{{The Rivermane Tribe}}
