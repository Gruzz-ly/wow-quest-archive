==Objectives==
Prove you're a worthy [[hunter]] by hunting Bonebeak Hawks in [[Sunfrost Glade]].
* [[Bonebeak Hawk]] slain (6)

==Description==
I don't know why [[Hemet Nesingwary|Hemet]] hunts with [[Razik Gazbolt|Razik]]. His contraptions are unreliable at best!

A true hunter doesn't need gadgets to hunt. They rely on instinct, skill, and agility.

So tell me, <name>, do you have the skills of a true hunter? Better yet, prove it.

Take down some of the Bonebeak Hawks that circle the nearby meadow.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You can't be huntin' hawks if you're here chattin' at me.

==Completion==
Now that's how a real hunter does it.

==Progression==
{{Hemet's Hunting Party}}
