==Notes==
Triggers at [[Clackbrine Coast]]. Run over the Greater Slimeweed, piles of seaweed in the shallows. You will have to defend yourself from the [[Clackbrine Snapper]]s as the slimeweed is usually within their aggro radius. Tufferfish just need to be killed.

After completeing those, you'll be given the Brineclaw objective.
