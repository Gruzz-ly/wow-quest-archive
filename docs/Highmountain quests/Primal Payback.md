:[[Hemet Nesingwary|Hemet]] and [[Nesingwary Safari (group)|his hunters]] bring death and destruction wherever they go, slaughtering innocent animals for sport. They must pay for their crimes against nature.
 
:If the animals of this basin could speak, they would ask for our help. Let's level the playing field a bit and let those [[Pinerock Hunter|hunters]] be hunted for a change.

:I will alter your form to resemble a creature native to this region. Once transformed, those hunters will become your prey. 

:Are you ready?

''{{Gossip|I am ready.}}''

== Notes ==
You will be transformed into a Mountain Prowler,  Bristlefur Bear, or Rockhorn Stag through [[Transform: Mountain Prowler]]/[[Transform: Bristlefur Bear]]/[[Transform: Rockhorn Stag]]. The one used will not change for the duration that the quest is available. The abilities the forms come with can only be used on the quest mobs: anything else that doesn't happen to be another quest objective can only be killed with auto attack, and are only lootable when not transformed. If you happen to be training [[Addie Fizzlebog]], she will not gain hunting experience while you are transformed.
