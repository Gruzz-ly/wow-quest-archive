==Objectives==
Rescue Jale Rivermane, Warbrave Oro, and Oakin Ironbull.
* [[Jale Rivermane]] rescued
* [[Warbrave Oro]] rescued
* [[Oakin Ironbull]] rescued

==Description==
If we have one good fortune in this it is that [[Dargrul]] has no knowledge of how to use the hammer.

He keeps thinking of the hammer as a weapon instead of a tool of creation.

Even so, he has imprisoned our tribesman in fists of stone summoned from the earth. Our weapons have proven useless against this magic.

You might have power enough to break these fists. Can you help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
* 15,050 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
How are the captives?  Did you find them alive?

==Completion==
It has been an age of more since the drogbar last walked the surface in such numbers.

They became the dark stories we tell children.
