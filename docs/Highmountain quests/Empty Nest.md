==Objectives==
Place the [[eagle]] eggs in the empty nest above the eastern entrance to [[Rockcrawler Chasm]].
*Eagle Eggs Placed
*[[Eagle Eggs]] (provided)

==Description==
I've taken an inventory of the eggs you recovered. Some among the bunch may still have a chance to hatch.

They will need to be returned to an empty nest, and with any luck, an eagle will claim the eggs as her own and watch over them once again.

There is a nest just outside the entrance, on a rocky ledge above the cave.

Be careful, <name>. The eggs are very delicate.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70}}
*7,400 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]
*[[Skyhorn Nestling]]

==Progress==
If there's any hope for those eggs hatching, they'll need to be returned to their nest.

==Completion==
Thanks to you, the great eagles of [[Highmountain]] will live on.

One of the eggs I thought was too damaged to salvage appears to be hatching...

==Notes==
Upon placing the eggs, a [[Great Eagle]] appears and lands in the nest.
