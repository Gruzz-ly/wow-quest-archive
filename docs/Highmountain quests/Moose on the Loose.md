==Objectives==
Collect the antlers of the cursed ancient [[ghost|spirit]], [[Morashu]].
* [[Morashu's Antlers]]
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
There's been chatter around the hunters' lodge about a crazed [[moose]] that is terrorizing the basin.

I've never laid eyes on the beast myself, but they say its antlers are illuminated with [[magic]].

Where other lesser [[hunter]]s have tried and failed, you will prevail, and collect me a one-of-a-kind trophy!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80|}}
* 18,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==

==Completion==
These antlers are going to look quite impressive hanging from the walls of the hunters' lodge.
