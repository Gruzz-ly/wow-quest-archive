==Objectives==
Follow [[Spiritwalker Ebonhorn]] on the [[Path of Huln]].
* Escort Spiritwalker Ebonhorn to the Path of Huln
* Jump in to the [[Neltharion's Vault|Vault]]

==Description==
Armies are vital to the success of a war. But so are symbols.

For our people, few things make for a better symbol than the blessings of our most eldest ancestors.

[[Mayla Highmountain|Mayla]] must walk the Path of Huln.

The path is dangerous, and she may only bring two people with her: a spiritwalker to guide her and a champion to protect her.

Will you be the champion?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|32|40}} (at level 102)
*30,150 [[XP]] (at level 102)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
Quite a drop. Mind yourself in here, this is not a safe place.

==Notes==
When being distracted by Ettins and trying to keep up with Ebonhorn he says the following:
*{{text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|We should really keep moving.}}
*{{text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|Is it wise to wait in a field of ettins?}}
*{{text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|No rush, Champion. We are just in the middle of a field of ettins. I am sure nothing bad could possibly happen.}}
*{{text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|Let me know when you are ready to continue, champion.}}

Getting close to the objective:
:{{text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|For Huln, the [[War of the Ancients]] did not end at the [[Well of Eternity]]. With the [[Burning Legion|Legion]] defeated, he focused on the monster that got away.}}
:{{text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|Welcome, my friends, to the Vault of Neltharion. Or as the world came to know him: [[Deathwing]].}}
:Ebonhorn lights a brazier, and a vision of Deathwing, Huln, and [[Ancestral Warbrave]]s appear.
:{{text|yell|Huln Highmountain|Stand your ground, warbraves!}}
:{{text|yell|Vision of Deathwing|You dare challenge me?!}}
