==Objectives==
Recover [[Addie Fizzlebog|Addie]]'s manuscript from [[Sated Hillstrider]]s within [[Pinerock Basin]].
* [[The Rocky Hills of Highmountain]]

==Description==
I've followed [[Hemet Nesingwary|Hemet]] on all his expeditions from [[Stranglethorn Vale|Stranglethorn]] to [[Nagrand]] to... {{Au|Nagrand}} again, taking notes on his grand adventures and turning them into timeless literary tales.

But my heart is really in the hunt. I want nothing more than to put down the pen, and pick up a rifle!

Hemet promised to teach me how to hunt once I finish his latest novel, but the [[goat]]s around here ate my first draft!

I have no hope of becoming a [[hunter]] if my manuscript isn't recovered.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

}}

==Progress==
I've been waitin' all day for Addie to finish her first draft.

How hard can it be to write a few words about the greatest hunter who's ever lived?

==Completion==
I've been eager to get my hands on this manuscript! I was startin' to think the [[gnome]] had writer's block.

==Progression==
{{Hemet's Hunting Party}}
