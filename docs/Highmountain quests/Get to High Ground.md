==Objectives==
Bring [[Jale Rivermane]] to [[Thunder Totem]].
* Lead Jale Rivermane to Thunder Totem
* Follow Jale to [[Mayla Highmountain]]

==Description==
It is no accident that [[Dargrul]] attacked the [[Rivermane tribe|Rivermane]] in force. It is their farms and their pastures that supply food for the region.

Please, get Jale to Thunder Totem. With luck, the High Chieftain will have reinforcements to send to the area.

We will rally the survivors here and follow as quickly as we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
Have you had any luck with the Rivermane?

==Completion==
Riverbend was... destroyed? That disgusting beast Dargrul! I will not stop until I see him dead.

But we cannot do that with the army we have.

We need help from the other tribes.

==Notes==
''Accept:''
: ''Jale joins the party.''
:{{text|say|Jale Rivermane|When Dargrul stole the [[:Hammer of Khaz'goroth]] he did so right in front of myself and the other chieftains.}}
:{{text|say|Jale Rivermane|Our last High Chieftain, Ulan, tried to stop him and was slain. Mayla may have picked up her father's totem, but she is not High Chieftain yet.}}
:{{text|say|Jale Rivermane|Dargrul didn't just steal a hammer, he shattered our people, driving a wedge between our tribes.}}

On the way you'll be attacked twice by [[Bitestone Roadhog]]s, take them out.

Reaching the bridge outside Thunder Totem:
: ''Jale makes her way across the bridge and through the Rivermane's [[Path of Water]].''
:{{text|say|Jale Rivermane|Thank you champion. We should be safe now. Come, let us speak with Mayla.}}

Getting to Mayla:
: ''Mayla is relieved.''
:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|Jale!  You have returned.  Thank the spirits.}}
: ''As she grimly reports, Jale places the Rivermane tribe's totem in front of the Highmountain Tribe totem pole.''
:{{text|say|Jale Rivermane|Mayla, child, the Underking has destroyed Riverbend.}}
: ''Mayla is shocked.''
:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|Destroyed?}}

Completing this quest finishes the Riverbend criterion of [[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]].

==Progression==
{{Riverbend}}

==Beta version==

*Quest ender: [[Warbrave Nava]]

When getting to Mayla:
:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|Destroyed?}}
:{{text|say|Jale Rivermane|Yes. This hero got us to safety, but we MUST get the other tribes back here to help us. We cannot stand divided.}}
