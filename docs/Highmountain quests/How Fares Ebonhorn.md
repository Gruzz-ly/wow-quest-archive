==Objectives==
Return to [[Thunder Totem]] and check on [[Ebonhorn]].

==Description==
Three of the ancient wards are restored. The mountain is not yet secure, but we may have done enough to break Ebonhorn free of the shadows gripping him.

Let us return to Thunder Totem and see how he fares. Hopefully Ebonhorn can tell us more about what is happening with the [[Necrodark]] and the insidious master they serve.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
I am myself again, <name>.

You and [[Spiritwalker Graysky|Graysky]] have freed me from the grasp of the [[Old God]]s. Had I remained in that state for much longer, I would have been lost.

==Notes==
