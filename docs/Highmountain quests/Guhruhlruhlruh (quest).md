==Objectives==
Defeat Guhruhlruhlruh.
* [[Guhruhlruhlruh]] slain

==Description==
The [[murloc]]s are usually pretty scared of us, but some bigger one led them into our cavern and they're getting too brave.

Kill their leader. I think its name is something like "Guhruhlruhlruh."

==Progress==
Can you pronounce murloc names? I never can.

That ought to send some of the murlocs packing.
