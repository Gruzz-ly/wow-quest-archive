==Objectives==
Find [[Razik Gazbolt]] at [[Icepine Point]].

==Description==
If [[Addie Fizzlebog|Addie]]'s going to be a more permanent member of [[Nesingwary Safari (group)|the huntin' party]], then she'll need some specialty gear for someone her size.

My munitions expert should have some ideas about what kind of weapon would best suit a [[gnome]].

Stop by his camp and let him know that I'll be needin' a prototype soon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
A gnome [[hunter]], huh? Is that a joke?

Fine, fine. What the boss wants, the boss gets. I'll start working on a prototype as soon as I finish up my latest project.

==Progression==
