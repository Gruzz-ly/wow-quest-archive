==Objectives==
Collect 20 [[Shadowice Shard]]s.
* [[Shadowice Shard]] (20)

==Description==
We took down one of the [[Necrodark]]. [[Ebonhorn]] found that it held a shard of ice infused with shadow essence.

Perhaps the villains are using these shards as a kind of talisman. I suggest you deprive them of their trinkets.

I know little of such [[magic]]s, but it seemed that Ebonhorn had a use for them in mind.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
Did you find more of the shards?

==Completion==
Perfect timing, <name>. These shards will prove very useful in what I'm about to do.

==Progression==
{{Highmountain Horde}}
