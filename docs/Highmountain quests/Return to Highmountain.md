==Objectives==
Meet [[Mayla Highmountain]] at [[Thunder Totem]] in [[Highmountain]].

==Description==
[[Spiritwalker Ebonhorn]] remains in great danger. He and Mayla have returned to Highmountain, but I believe they still need our aid.

Let us journey to Thunder Totem and do whatever we can to mend Ebonhorn. Perhaps our deeds will strengthen the bond between our peoples.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Ebonhorn has spoken of ancient wards that must be maintained in Highmountain. Wards that hold back a great darkness.

This may be tied to the evil that grips him now.

We must hope that [[Spiritwalker Graysky]] can tell us more.

==Notes==
Upon accepting, Baine mounts a wyvern and flies away. The NPCs that were partying at the beginning of the questline are now partying again, along with the fighting guards and void creatures and their void-trapped counterparts in the tents. So is Baine duplicated in his tent.

==Progression==
{{Highmountain Horde}}

==Patch changes==
