==Objectives==
Seek out [[Barm Stonebreaker]] at the [[Ironhorn Enclave]] in [[Highmountain]].
* Seek out Barm Stonebreaker in Highmountain
* [[Rivermane Remedy]] (15)
* [[Cracked Dual-Chambered Mixing Flask]] (provided)

==Description==
You know, this mixing flask didn't suffer terrible damage. I'm positive it can just be repaired.

I'm no expert in glass repair, but I've heard of someone who is--a [[Highmountain tauren|tauren]] by the name of Barm Stonebreaker. He's a [[smith]] by trade, but those who know him say he was born to work glass.

Those tauren don't work for free, so you may be in for some work yourself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15,620 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You're looking for help? I hope you have something to offer my people in return, <race>.

==Completion==
Your gift is a noble gesture, <race>. Smithing can be a surprisingly perilous profession.

Now let's see that flask.

<Barm examines the cracked flask.>

Eh, that's not so bad. Give me a moment to fix it.

<Barm begins working the glass, repairing the fissure in the glass.>

==Notes==
;Speaking with Barm Stonebreaker
:{{Gossip|Would you be able to repair this flask for me?}}

::You ask for my help, yet you have nothing to offer in return, <race>. If that's the case, then perhaps you can do [[Ironhorn tribe|my tribe]] a favor.

::It's been years since we've tasted the [[Rivermane tribe|Rivermane]]'s brew. Their remedy is known to have revitalizing powers and it does wonders for the teeth. And fortunately I happen to know how to brew it.

::I'll give you my mortar and pestle, along with the recipe for creating the remedy. You bring back enough for my tribe and I'll fix your flask.

::Agreed?

::{{Gossip|Agreed.}}
:''The player receives [[Barm's Mortar and Pestle]].''

:{{Text|say|Barm Stonebreaker|You'll find a pumpkin patch at the Rivermane's camp. Choose the ripest ones for their juice.}}
:{{Text|say|Barm Stonebreaker|And foxflower flourishes all around Highmountain. Good luck, <race>.}}

Loot 15 {{item|Ripe Pumpkin Juice|s}} from [[Ripe Pumpkin (Highmountain)|Ripe Pumpkin]]s in [[Earthmother's Bounty]] and obtain 60 {{item|Foxflower|s}}, then use the mortar and peste to create 15 [[Rivermane Remedy|Rivermane Remedies]].
