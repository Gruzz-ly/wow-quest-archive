==Objectives==
Meet [[Spiritwalker Ebonhorn]] at the southern bluff of [[Thunder Totem]].

==Description==
[[Mayla Highmountain|Mayla's]] father, [[Ulan Highmountain|Ulan]], was our last high chieftain.  He was slain trying to stop the Underking from seizing the [[:Hammer of Khaz'goroth]].

I have watched Mayla all her life and can tell you she has both the courage and the strength to wear the mantle of High Chieftain.

She needs only our help to realize it herself.

Will you meet us at the city entrance along the southern bluff?  There is a ritual that might help, but we will need your aid to survive it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} ({{cost|19|40}} at level 110)
* 15,200 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
Ah, thank you for coming.  Mayla is as stubborn as her father if not more so.

==Notes==

;Objectives
Speak with Spiritwalker Ebonhorn at Thunder Totem.

;Description
If Mayla is truly ready to take up the mantle of High Chieftain she will need to follow in the footsteps of those High Chieftains before her.

And she will need your help in doing so.

If you are willing, join us in my spirit lodge when you are ready. It is up the elevators and across the southwestern most bridge.

I have a few others that should join us as well.

;Progress
''On approach:''
: ''Enter the tent where, along with Ebonhorn and Mayla, are also [[Baine Bloodhoof]], [[Sunwalker Dezco]] and [[Roanauk Icemist]].''
:{{text|say|Baine Bloodhoof|Even now the [[Burning Legion]] marches unchecked on the [[Broken Shore]].  We need your aid.}}
:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|You are High Chieftain.  You must show your people that no artifact - no weapon - can stand before the might of a united Highmountain.}}

;Completion
Ah, thank you for coming. I was just discussing with these outsiders some of our customs.
