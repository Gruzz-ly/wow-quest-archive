==Objectives==
Hunt Pinerock Elderhorn in [[Pinerock Basin]].
* [[Pinerock Elderhorn]] slain (8)

==Description==
[[Highmountain]] is home to wildlife that can't be hunted anywhere else in the [[Azeroth|world]]. Tell me, <name>, have you ever laid eyes on a [[moose]] before?

The roaming Elderhorn may look like gentle giants, but only a fool would underestimate their strength.

They should prove to be a good challenge, even for someone as experienced as you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ya can't be huntin' Elderhorn if you're lingerin' around camp.

==Completion==
You've hunted the Highmountain Elderhorn and lived to tell about it. That's not a feat that most can say they've accomplished. Color me impressed.

==Progression==
