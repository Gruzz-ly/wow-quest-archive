==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Wrathshard.jpg|Wrathshard|Summoned by the [[drogbar]] to destroy [[Thunder Totem]].}}
Slay Wrathshard.
* [[Wrathshard]] slain

==Description==
[[Dargrul|The Underking]] has used the [[:Hammer of Khaz'goroth]] to render the mountainside into a weapon against us.  The hammer is a tool for creation, not a weapon for his amusement!

Even now, his crystal servant, Wrathshard, is driving these elementals out of the mountain down upon my people.

We must hold the bridge against this onslaught.

Enter the cave, find Wrathshard, and send him back to his master in pieces.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Snowblind Cord
|Drogstitch Belt
|Whitewater Cinch
|Thunderpeak Girdle
|Snowblind Leggings
|Drogstitch Breeches
|Whitewater Legwraps
|Thunderpeak Legplates}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
* 14,800 [[XP]] (15,050 at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
Dargrul always was a vile creature.  I never realized to what extent until he got his hands on that hammer.

==Completion==
I suspect this is not the last of Dargrul's assaults.  He is still learning the powers of the Hammer like a child with a new toy.

==Notes==
You may most likely come across this quest or at least become aware of it while getting [[Mu'sha's Tears]] for [[To See the Past]].  Make sure to also pick up [[No Time to Talk]] before setting out.
