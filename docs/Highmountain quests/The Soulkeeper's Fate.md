==Objectives==
Find [[Soulkeeper Uriah]] within [[Mucksnout Den]].
*Find Soulkeeper Uriah

==Description==
Soulkeeper Uriah was injured in the [[kobold]] attack, but insisted on venturing further into the cave to recover the stolen [[Soul Chamber|soul shards]]. He told me to wait here with our remaining supplies until he returned, but I fear the worst.

Please find Uriah. He is the only one who knows how to trap the [[demon]]s.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (level 100)
*14,800 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Completion==
Uriah would not want me to waste time with tears. My mourning can wait until the escaped demons are trapped once again.

==Notes==
Soulkeeper Uriah is found at {{coords|30.9|62.1|Mucksnout Den}}, heavily wounded and kneeling next to a pair of dead kobolds. Upon interacting with him, the following exchange occurs:
:{{text|yell|Soulkeeper Uriah|Rosalyn! Where is Rosalyn?!}}
:''Apprentice Rosalyn appears a short distance away and runs towards Uriah.''
:{{text|say|Apprentice Rosalyn|Uriah! I'm here! Where are you?}}
:''Rosalyn kneels in front of Uriah.''
:{{text|say|Apprentice Rosalyn|Oh Uriah, you're injured!}}
:{{text|say|Apprentice Rosalyn|<Name>, we must do something to save him!}}
:{{text|say|Soulkeeper Uriah|I am beyond saving, Rosalyn. You need to focus on finding the demons that have been released from the soul chambers and trap them once again, before it's too late.}}
:{{text|say|Apprentice Rosalyn|But... but I don't know how, Uriah. I cannot do it without you!}}
:{{text|say|Soulkeeper Uriah|You can, Rosalyn, and you will. You're more gifted than you let yourself believe.}}
:{{text|emote|Soulkeeper Uriah exhales tiredly as the last bit of breath leaves his lifeless body.}}
:''Uriah expires. Rosalyn walks a few feet away to stand next to a large rock.''
:{{text|say|Apprentice Rosalyn|I can't believe he's gone...}}
Speak with Rosalyn to turn in the quest.
