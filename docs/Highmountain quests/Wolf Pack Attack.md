==Objectives==
Shoot the Critter Hand Cannon near [[wolf]] packs so that they scatter, allowing the packleaders to be singled out.
* [[Icefang Packleader]]s killed (6)
* [[Critter Hand Cannon (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
It's time to attack the pack! I've preloaded the hand cannon. All you have to do is point and shoot.

The [[critter]]s should survive the blast and hit the ground running. The howlers will be distracted by the critters, allowing you to focus on killing the packleaders.

Happy hunting!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The critter hand cannon is loaded and ready for use! Just aim for one of the packs nearby. The packleaders should be easy to kill once the howlers are distracted.

==Completion==
You made it back without any scratches. It looks like the backfire issue from the last prototype worked itself out.

A few more tweaks and I'd say this hand cannon is ready for mass production. Thanks for the help, <name>.
