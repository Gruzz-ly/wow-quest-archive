==Objectives==
Evacuate Red Skymane, Tarvim Daywalker, and Old Nefu.
* [[Red Skymane]] evacuated
* [[Tarvim Daywalker]] evacuated
* [[Old Nefu]] evacuated

==Description==
They just keep coming!

And now my scouts report some of the [[drogbar]] have managed to sneak around our flank and are attacking [[Snowmane Village]].

Go, help the evacuation. We will hold the line here and try to buy you some time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
I knew we should have secured this town better.

==Completion==
And not a moment too soon. Our [[scout]]s report the [[Dargrul|Underking]] himself has come.

==Notes==
;[[Red Skymane]]
They did not give me enough time to gather my things. Do you think they will be safe? I don't want those drogbar rummaging through my personal stuff.

:{{gossip|There is no time left. Run!}}
:{{text|say|Red Skymane|I am not leaving without my [[Kaya]]!}}
:''She picks up the fox and runs.''

;[[Tarvim Daywalker]]
These braves are near death. They will not be able to move themselves.

:{{gossip|There is no time left. Run!}}
:{{text|say|Tarvim Daywalker|So be it. Come my wounded friends, let us see if I might have the strength that is needed to carry you to safety.}}
:''He picks up the two braves and runs.''

;[[Old Nefu]]
I am not leaving, child. And that is that. No underking is going to scare me out of MY home.

:{{gossip|There is no time left. Run!}}
:{{text|say|Old Nefu|Fah! This is OUR mountain. Let the drogbar savages come. We have the power of the spirits, of this mountain. All they have are sticks and stones and anger.}}
