==Objectives==
Use your blacksmithing skill to craft a pair of Leystone Gauntlets for [[Barm Stonebreaker|Barm]].
* [[Leystone Gauntlets]]

==Description==
You wish me to teach you how to strengthen your crafts? We do not simply share the secrets of our trade with outsiders who ask for them.

We do, however, respect craftsmanship and discipline.

Let's see your hammerwork. Our greenhorn trainees use those small anvils over there. Craft your best pair of gauntlets so I may judge your work.

==Rewards==
* 15,620 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm waiting, outsider.

==Completion==
The craftsmanship is good, but the quality is feeble at best.

<Barm snaps the gauntlets in half and throws them to floor>

You have proven yourself worthy of my tutelage however.
