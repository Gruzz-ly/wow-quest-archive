==Objectives==
Head into [[Rockcrawler Chasm]] and recover [[eagle]] eggs.
*[[Eagle Egg]] (10)

==Description==
Eagles are revered by the [[Skyhorn tribe]], but their numbers are dwindling.

The [[drogbar]] feed their fledgling [[worm]]s eagle eggs so they'll grow strong enough to ride into battle.

If the drogbar continue to pilfer these eggs, the eagles may become extinct.

Head deeper into the cave and recover any eagle eggs you can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
If the pilfered eggs are not recovered, the eagle may go extinct.

==Completion==
These eggs are in poor condition, <name>. Some are cracked and spoiled, while others are cold to the touch.

Yet there is still hope. I believe a few of the eggs you recovered can be saved.
