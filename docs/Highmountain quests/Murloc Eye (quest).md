==Objectives==
Solve the riddle.
*[[Murloc Eye (quest item)]]

==Description==
<The [[murloc]] eye appears to have no magical properties of its own, but is still quite damp to the touch.

You have seen [[naga]] [[sorcerer]]s use similar objects in their casting rituals, but rarely do they dismember their murloc [[slave]]s for this purpose.

This is unsettling, even for the naga.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Radiant Azerite Fragment]] (700x [[Azerite (resource)]])
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,230 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh, hello, are you here about the terrible things happening to the murlocs?

I've been hearing tales of terrifying magical experiments happening in the depths, entire murloc [[tribe]]s being wiped out.

There is one area that they won't even go near anymore, the water bubbles ferociously and the heat is unbearable. The fish have all fled, everything has fled, what could be going on there?

Oh! They've been bringing me some of this [[:Azerite]], I'm not sure why. Do you want it?

Thanks for visiting!

==Notes==
If you completed the [[Shipwreck Cove]] story, King Mrgl-Mrgl will instead be located inside [[Murkloc Cave]].
