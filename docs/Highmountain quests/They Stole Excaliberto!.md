==Objectives==
Find Excaliberto and return it to [[Maximillian of Northshire|Maximillian]]

* [[Excaliberto]]

==Description==
I was scouting the nearby [[demon]] village when I was attacked. They took my artifact! Of course, if I leave here, the shore will be undefended. The nearby demons have it, go, slay them and bring it back to me!

==Progress==
Find Maximillians "Artifact" weapon, Excaliberto

==Completion==
Yes!

==Notes==
Kill the Swamprock murlocs in [[Shipwreck Cove]] until the sword drops.

Upon completing the quest, a brief cutscene will play showing Maximillian walking up onto the nearby rock and holding aloft Excaliberto, much like when a player obtains their [[artifact]] weapon.

==Progression==
