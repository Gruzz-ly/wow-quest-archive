==Notes==
;Talking with Maximillian
:What Ho! Welcome weary traveler. Come sit by my roaring fire. Never fear, I have secured this position on the beach head, and will soon thwart the [[Burning Legion|Legions]] assault on these lands!
:{{gossip|''Hello again Maximillian.''}}

::Squire? Is that you? I barely recognized you. You have not aged well! Never mind, I suppose even those of your advanced years must continue their training.
::{{gossip|''Training?''}}

:::Indeed squire! As you can see, I've assaulted this shore and have secured the beach against the Legion, but there is much work to do. They attempted to break through my defenses last eve, but I held the line stolcally against their assault. You can see their demonic corpses over yonder, though you may not possess the stomach to look upon them very long.
:::{{gossip|''I see two dead crabs, is that what you mean?''}}

::::Ha ha ha! Crabs you say? Your ignorance on these matters of demons is presenting itself readily! We must continue your training post haste, lest you fall forever into a pit of ignorance!
::::{{gossip|''Sigh... very well.''}}
