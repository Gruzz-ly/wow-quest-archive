==Objectives==
Defeat the Witch of the Wood.
*[[Witch of the Wood]] slain

==Description==
You saved me at [[Riverbend]] not long ago. It is the reason I vouched for you as emissary to this tribe, and the only reason you're alive here now. I consider my debt to you paid.

You must prove yourself to the [[Bloodtotem tribe|Bloodtotem]] chieftain before he will speak with you.

Within the forest is the Witch of the Wood, a [[harpy]] mother who recently descended into this territory. If you are able to defeat her and show her carcass to the Bloodtotem, they might allow you an audience with [[Torok Bloodtotem|Torok]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
The harpies moved after the drogbar attacked much of Highmountain. They saw an opportunity and ceased upon it.

==Completion==
The Bloodtotem don't often allow outsiders into their midst. Even asking them to give you an audience is a danger.

==Progression==
{{The Bloodtotem Tribe}}

==Patch changes==
