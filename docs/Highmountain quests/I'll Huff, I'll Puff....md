==Objectives==
Collect 5 Pufferfish Eggs.
*[[Pufferfish Egg]] (5)

==Description==
[[Murky]] is my favorite little fella. However, in order to lead a change in the [[murloc]] population here, he needs some awesome abilities. There are a lot of [[Pufferfish (mob)|pufferfish]] around in the water, and I think that they could be a good resource for him. Kill a few and collect their eggs for Murky.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Pufferfish have this impressive ability of... exploding. They could be a powerful tool for Murky.

==Completion==
The pufferfish will be a perfect resource for Murky! I'll just whip up a spell to make them grow more quickly.

All he'll have to do is throw, then boom!
