Slay Siegebrul Olgrul.
*[[Siegebrul Olgrul]] slain

==Description==
Worms do not like battle or the surface. They only go where their master tells them.

So, when in war, kill the master.

Siegebrul Olgrul is the master of worms for the Mightstone drogbar who attack us from the north.

Slay him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Progress==
Siegbrul Olgrul torments all who serve him. There are evil drogbar, and then there is this foul monster.

==Completion==
"Siegebrul." Bah!

Before this war we had no need for such titles.

Olgrul was always just a brute who takes pleasure in the pain of others.
