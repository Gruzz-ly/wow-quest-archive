==Objectives==
Interact with the five{{sic}} different resonating stones in [[Highmountain]]. Each stone requires 3 [[Highmountain Ritual-Stone]]s to activate.
* [[Rockcrawler Chasm Crystal]] {{co|48.4|34.6|Highmountain}}
* [[Mucksnout Den Crystal]] {{co|40.9|46.2|Highmountain}}

==Description==
I've delved into the caves here and have discovered many ancient writings.

The most interesting I've found are resonating crystals, where the [[drogbar]] have resided. Unfortunately, they aren't on very good terms with the [[tauren]] here and this has hindered my research.

I thought, should there be any trouble with the drogbar, that you'd be able to handle them.

I'd like you to continue my research and discover what you can about [[Huln Highmountain|Huln]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*16,450 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Lessah listens to your recounting of the stories you discovered.>

If what you've said is true then that means that the piece I'm looking for is the necklace that Huln once wore.

==Notes==
You have two choices here. You can either purchase the 6 [[Highmountain Ritual-Stone]] needed from the [[Auction House]], or farm them by surveying Highmountain dig sites.

The [[Rockcrawler Chasm Crystal]] is located on the main level inside [[Rockcrawler Chasm]]. If you enter the cavern from the [[Bloodhunt Highland]] side, the crystal will be on your right.

[[Mucksnout Den Crystal]] is located on the main level inside [[Mucksnout Den]]. It will be on your left if you enter the den from [[Pinerock Basin]].

''If you don't have the three necessary:''
:The crystal has three empty slots carved into it. You don't quite have enough keystones to activate it.


''If you do have enough:''
:The crystal has three empty slots carved into it.
:{{gossip|Place the three Highmountain Ritual-Stones into the crystal.}}

::This will remove 3 [[Highmountain Ritual-Stone]] from your inventory. Are you sure?

:::As you place the keystones into the crystal, it begins to hum with energy.
