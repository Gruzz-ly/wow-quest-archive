==Objectives==
Travel to Highmountain and investigate the [[Azerite Essence|essence]].
* Speak to [[MOTHER]] to travel to [[Highmountain]]
* Location investigated

==Description==
Manifestation of [[dragon]] essence detected. Location: Highmountain.

Assuming successful retrieval, calculations indicate 92.7 percent probability of empowering [[:Heart of Azeroth]].

Theory: By combining dragon essence with sufficient quantities of [[:Azerite]] within [[Heart Forge]], previously undiscovered abilities may manifest within Heart.

As [[Magni Bronzebeard|Speaker Magni]] would say: "Get to work, champion."

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What brings you here, <name>?

==Completion==
We must make haste. I feel the essence of [[Black dragonflight|my kin]] calling to me.

:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|<Name>! What brings you here?}}

;Interact with Ebonhorn
Ah, <name>, I haven't seen you since we were here last. What brings you to Highmountain?

{{Gossip|I'm investigating unusual magical activity in the area.}}

:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|Hmm, I too have sensed something deep beneath Highmountain... in the caverns that were once Neltharion's lair.}}
