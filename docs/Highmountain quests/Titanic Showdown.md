==Objectives==
Find and aid the spirit of [[Huln Highmountain]]. 
* Vision of [[Deathwing]]
* Deathwing banished

==Description==
The tale of Huln did not end with him acquiring the [[:Hammer of Khaz'goroth]].

No. For that part, we must venture deeper into this cavern. A final brazier awaits us ahead.

Come, let us see what happened next.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Snowblind Handwraps
|Drogstitch Gloves
|Whitewater Gauntlets
|Thunderpeak Gauntlets
|Explorer's Delving Loop
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
And so Huln cast out Deathwing into the land of [[Deepholm]] and claimed the Hammer of Khaz'goroth as his charge.

But there was one last bit of business for him to attend to...

==Notes==
Activate the [[Highmountain Brazier]] to witness the banishment of Deathwing:
:{{text|say|Vision of Deathwing|I will not be undone by some mortal filth! I am the Earth-Warder!}}
:''[[Rebel Drogbar]], [[Ancestral Warbrave]]s, and [[Igrul the Scalebane]] attack Deathwing.''

After Deathwing gets to low health, Huln completes the incantation:
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|By the power of the [[titan]]s, I banish you from this land Earth-Warder!}}

==Progression==
{{Secrets of Highmountain}}

==Beta version==
{{Rfb-section|Legion}}
This was an Alliance quest, with the Horde equivalent being [[High Chieftains]].

;Description
The greatest time scar of all is just ahead.

Khaz'goroth was the titan who shaped the world. Using his hammer against Deathwing, the aspect of earth, had dire consequences.

Go, speak with Huln and witness the reason why the name "Highmountain" is feared amongst dragons to this day.

;Completion
As you can see, Highmountain was a force that drove Deathwing from this plane of existence.

No black dragon has dared return to this place since.

Until now.

;Speaking with Huln
:We have lost so many today, I did not think another champion would make it through. Come, we have a hard fight ahead of us. Are you ready?

:{{Gossip|Ready.}}
:''Huln, Igrul, and [[Time-Lost Drogbar]] aid in the attack.''

[[A Timely Opportunity]] was the next quest.
