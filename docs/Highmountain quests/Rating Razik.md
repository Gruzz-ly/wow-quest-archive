==Objectives==
Find [[Hemet Nesingwary]] at his [[Highmountain]] retreat.

==Description==
Hemet is expecting an update on how my munitions research and development is going.

I'm sure you'll be happy to tell my boss that my latest creation worked flawlessly!

You can find him at his camp near the hunters' lodge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|94|}}
* 1,480 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It's good to hear that [[Razik Gazbolt|Razik]] is makin' some progress on his gadgets.

Maybe if he could design a gun that aims itself, these amateurs infesting the basin would hit their targets for once.

==Progression==
{{Hemet's Hunting Party}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
