==Objectives==
Obtain Grayheft, Ancient Hammer of the Highmountain Tauren from [[Kubrul]] within the [[Deep Roads]] cavern.
* [[Grayheft, Ancient Hammer of the Highmountain Tauren]]

==Description==
[[Ironhorn tribe|Our tribe]] regularly crafts legplates out of [[Leystone Ore|leystone]]. I will share our pattern with you... if you do me a favor.

My father fell to the [[drogbar]] several years ago, and they took his hammer as a trophy. That hammer was in my family for countless generations. Now, it languishes in the hands of the vile drogbar, Kubrul.

I would very much like to have it back.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Recipe: [[Leystone Greaves]] Rank 2

You will also receive:
*{{cost|17|36|50}}
* 19,530 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I have no patterns for helms or boots.

A [[tauren]] who cannot survive a few blows to the hoof has no place in battle. Boots are of little use to us.

A helm is a coward's armor. I am sorry if this offends you, but it is true.

Legplates, however, do play a vital role. I will gladly share this pattern with you, once you bring me my father's hammer.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>.

Thank you.
