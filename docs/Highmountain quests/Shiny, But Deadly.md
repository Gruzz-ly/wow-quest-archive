==Objectives==
Collect Soul Chambers from [[kobold]]s within [[Mucksnout Den]].
*[[Soul Chamber]] (7)

==Description==
[[Soulkeeper Uriah]] and I were transporting [[demon]] prisoners to [[Allari the Souleater|Allari]] in [[Azsuna]] when our caravan was attacked by kobolds.

Those mindless vermin made off with the soul chambers that house our demonic captives.

The crystals may be shiny, but they're also deadly. If they are damaged in any way, the demons trapped within may escape.

Head into the cave nearby and recover the soul chambers before it's too late.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (level 100)
*14,800 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Progress==
Have you recovered the soul chambers yet?

==Completion==
Is this all you could find?

While I'm grateful to have these gems in my possession once again, it seems that there are still a few missing. I fear they've been broken, which means the demons within have escaped.

==Notes==
Soul Chambers can drop from [[Mucksnout Aggressor]]s, [[Mucksnout Collector]]s, [[Mucksnout Hoarder]]s or [[Mucksnout Scavenger]]s throughout the Mucksnout Den.
