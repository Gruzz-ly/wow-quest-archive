==Objectives==
Find [[Windmaster Julan]] and help extinguish the fires on [[Skyhorn]].
* Find Windmaster Julan
* Fires extinguished (8)

==Description==
I know why [[Mayla Highmountain|Mayla]] sent you. But as you have seen, the [[drogbar]] are not the only threat to Highmountain.

I will not send forces to support until we deal with the minions of [[High Crawliac]].

If you want to help, find my shaman. He was supposed to be dispersing these fires that are ravaging my village.

He was last seen heading for his spirit lodge to the south just before these Cinderwitches descended on us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
These [[Harpy|harpies]] are all over the place!

==Completion==
Julan is dead? He was a good shaman and full of life. Not as morbid as some of these spiritwalkers.

I will miss his laughter tonight.

==Notes==
;Interacting with the body of Windmaster Julan
:This smoldering corpse is clutching a totem wreathed with wind spirits.

:{{gossip|Take the Windmaster's Totem.}}

Use the Suppressing Wind extra action button on the nearby fires.
