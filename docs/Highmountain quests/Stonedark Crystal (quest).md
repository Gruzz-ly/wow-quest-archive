==Objectives==
Find [[Navarrogg]]'s Stonedark Focus.
* [[Stonedark Focus]]

==Description==
Without my crystalline focus, my powers are weak. Those who captured me took it, and I know not where it is now.

I'm sure one of the [[Bloodtotem tribe|Feltotem]] has it. If you find it, please return it to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
I have power over the earth without my crystal, but my power is much greater with it than without.

==Completion==
This will help me repair my broken body.
