==Objectives==
Collect 4 Bristlefur Pelts within the [[Fields of An'she]].
* [[Bristlefur Pelt]] (4)

==Description==
They say a single hair from the back of a bristlefur [[bear]] is sharp enough to cut a [[dwarf]]'s beard. But if the fur doesn't kill ya, the maul will.

Some lesser [[hunter]]s have been a meal for those bears.

Show me you're more than a snack and bring me back a few of those bristlefur pelts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Procuring a few Bristlefur Pelts should help sell me on your huntin' skills.

==Completion==
These pelts are even sharper than I imagined. Well done, <name>.

==Progression==
