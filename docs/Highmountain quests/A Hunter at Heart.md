==Objectives==
Help [[Addie Fizzlebog|Addie]] learn to hunt by killing wildlife in [[Pinerock Basin]].
* Speak to Addie
* Complete Addie's apprentice training
* Complete Addie's journeyman training
* Complete Addie's expert training

==Description==
Addie's one heck of a writer, but I've never seen her hold a rifle. She's keen on learning how to hunt, but who's ever heard of a [[gnome]] [[hunter]]?

You seem to have a knack dealin' with amateurs, so maybe you'd be willin' to let the gnome tag along on a hunt? She could learn a thing or two by shadowing someone with your skill.

Ya best start off with some small game. We don't want the lass to get discouraged.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|38|80|}}
* 18,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Keep an eye on the gnome while you're huntin' She's never held a rifle before.

==Completion==
You haven't got any holes in ya, I guess that means Addie's aim isn't as bad as I thought!

==Notes==

;Speaking with Addie Fizzlebog
:Hemet asked you to teach me how to hunt?

:I'm glad you're up for the job. There's a lot I need to learn, but I think I know which end of the rifle to shoot with...

:I'm ready whenever you are!
