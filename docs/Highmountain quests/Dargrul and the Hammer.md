Confront [[Dargrul the Underking]].
* Confront Dargrul the Underking
* Escape [[Bitestone Enclave]]

==Description==
We are about to follow a [[drogbar]] into a cave, something we warn our children never to do.

Even so, several of our warbraves have already followed Dargrul inside.

Come, join us in battle and let us reclaim the [[Hammer of Khaz'goroth]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Staunch Warbrave Loop

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
This is a hard day.

==Completion==
[[Warbrave Oro|Oro]] and the others? Did they make it out as well?

Such destruction. So many good warbraves have fallen today.

It is clear now, we will need the full might of the Highmountain tribes if we are to recover the hammer.

''On accept:''
:{{text|say|Warbrave Oro|Well timed, champion. We have cleared a path to Dargrul. This way...}}
: ''Oro runs down further into the cave, where a group of [[Highmountain Warbrave]]s have gathered below Dargrul.  Behind him stands [[Ularogg Cragshaper]].''
:{{text|yell|Warbrave Oro|Dargrul the Underking! Come down here and face justice for those you have betrayed.}}
:{{text|say|Dargrul|You dare challenge me?}}
: ''Dargrul leaps down with Ularogg and smashes the ground with the Hammer, causing spikes to shoot from the ground, impaling and petrifying Oro and the Warbraves, killing them.  The player is instead imprisoned in the [[Grasp of Dargrul]], a stone fist.''
:{{text|yell|Warbrave Oro|Aaaaah!}}
:{{text|say|Ularogg Cragshaper|My underking, this one still lives.}}
:{{text|say|Dargrul|I want this shan ronir to tell the others. Tell them their doom will come once I master this hammer.}}
: ''They run off into the cave.  By the time the player has freed themselves from the fist, the two are long gone.''

The "Escape the Grasp of Dargrul" criterion appears briefly on the screen after clicking on the Grasp, but it is not listed in quest log or quest tracking.
