==Objectives==
Free 6 [[Highmountain Protector]]s.
*Highmountain Protector freed (6)

==Description==
Before our arrival, many of our own came to neutralize the threat here. They did not know what they were walking into.

Our people are now suffering from the whispers. The [[Old God]]s seek to corrupt them and turn them against their own.

Wake them from their stupor. Free them from the whispers any way you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. If left unchecked, the whispers can turn even the best of friends against one another.

==Notes==
Interact with the Protectors - some will die instantly, some will need to be killed, and some are saved successfully.
