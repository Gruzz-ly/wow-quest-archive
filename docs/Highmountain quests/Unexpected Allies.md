==Objectives==
Speak with [[Mayla Highmountain]] at [[Thunder Totem]].
* Meet [[Navarrogg]] at Thunder Totem
* Witness the Stonedark Ritual

==Description==
You have gained my trust. Not all [[drogbar]] are as violent as the savages led by [[Dargrul the Underking]], nor are all [[Highmountain tauren|tauren]] as bloodthirsty as the [[Bloodtotem tribe|Bloodtotem]].

You may tell Mayla Highmountain that she has our support. The cavern we call home is yours to explore freely as well, <name>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
|Stonedark's Pledge
}}

*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
Has Torok agreed to join us?

==Completion==
Torok is dead? By... your hand? He must have truly given in to his thirst for blood if that came to pass.

The Stonedark on our side, though... That is an advantage I had not expected. Navarrogg has always been much more agreeable than Dargrul and his brood. Thank you for striking this rare alliance, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept, Navarrogg starts walking towards the eastern part of the grotto:
:{{text|say|Navarrogg|Welcome to [[Stonedark Grotto]]. It doesn't look like much, but it is our home.}}
:{{text|say|Navarrogg|Here, we live in peace away from the other drogbar.}}
:{{text|yell|Navarrogg|Stonedark! I have returned! We have this one to thank for saving us from the Bloodtotem.}}
:{{Text|yell|Navarrogg|We will help their cause when it is asked of us.}}
:{{text|say|Navarrogg|Oh, and don't kill <her/him>.}}

At Thunder Totem:
: ''Navarrogg is waiting for you outside the [[Path of Earth]] that the Bloodtotem represented.''
:You saved my people from the Feltotem and their [[Burning Legion|Legion]] allies. We will now help you and your Highmountain allies against [[Dargrul]] and his mindless followers.
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}
: ''Navarrogg turns around and quickly heads through the Path of Earth.''
:{{text|say|Navarrogg|I am nervous about entering this place. Best hurry in before they change their mind about allowing me safe passage.}}
Upon arriving in the [[Hall of Chieftains]]:
:{{text|yell|Navarrogg|I, Navarrogg, leader of the Stonedark drogbar, declare my allegiance to the Highmountain tribe.}}
:''Navarrogg places a stone fist, the symbol of the Stonedark tribe, before the Highmountain totem pole in the southeast center of the chamber.''
:{{text|yell|Navarrogg|Together, we are Highmountain!}}
:''Navarrogg walks over to take his place next to [[Jale Rivermane]].''
