==Objectives==
Meet [[Oakin Ironbull]] at [[Cliff's Edge]].

==Description==
The [[Bloodtotem tribe|Bloodtotem]] are led by [[Torok Bloodtotem|Torok]], a volatile but useful tauren chieftain. He is wary of outsiders, but I believe you have already met an emissary to their tribe--Oakin Ironbull--whom you rescued at [[Riverbend]].

Use that small thread and you may be able to bring the Bloodtotem back into the fold. [[Highmountain Tribe|Highmountain]] needs them if we are to defeat the [[drogbar]] and reclaim the [[:Hammer of Khaz'goroth]]. Be on your guard, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}} (at level 100)
*1,500 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Completion==
Outsider, you are one of few from beyond Highmountain who has made it into these woods alive. With me vouching for you, the Bloodtotem have been given a no-kill order by Torok.
