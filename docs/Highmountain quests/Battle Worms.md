==Objectives==
Slay Naxa, Arxas, and Xist.
* [[Naxa]] slain
* [[Arxas]] slain
* [[Xist]] slain

==Description==
[[Snowmane Village]] behind us was caught completely off guard by the scale of this attack. I will hold the [[drogbar]] line here so we have time to evacuate civilians.

The drogbar are using worms to burrow their way to the surface and deploy their troops.

I am giving you command of our forces. Use them to slay these worms and cut off enemy reinforcements.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Progress==
Worms. Why did it have to be worms? I hate worms.

==Completion==
That should slow these invaders down.

==Notes==
