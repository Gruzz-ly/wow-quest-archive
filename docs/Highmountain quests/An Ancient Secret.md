==Objectives==
Assist [[Ebyssian|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn]] in [[Neltharion's Vault]].
*Vision of Ebon Wings witnessed
*Defend [[Huln Highmountain|Huln]]
*Listen to Ebonhorn

==Description==
Before [[Mayla Highmountain|Mayla]] may be pronounced High Chieftain, there is one more vision she must see. I wish to show you as well.

It is an ancient secret, handed down along the [[Highmountain Tribe|Highmountain]] bloodline. I ask for your discretion in keeping it that way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|80}} (at level 100)
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
That day, [[Hammer of Khaz'goroth|the hammer]] freed me of the corruption of the [[Black dragonflight|Black Dragonflight]].

In gratitude, I have faithfully served the Highmountain family since Huln rescued me from this pit.

It has been my honor and my pleasure to watch each of his descendants earn the title of High Chieftain.

==Notes==
Follow Mayla and Ebonhorn up the ramp immediately to the east.
:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|So Huln never backed down, no matter the enemy?}}
:{{text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|History is forged by the hearts of heroes, child. This is the truth [[Ulan Highmountain|your father]] wanted you to see.}}
:{{text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|[[Highmountain tauren|Our people]] need a leader like Huln. One with the strength and courage to face any obstacle. Qualities you have proven to possess.}}
:{{text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|And so there is one final vision you must witness. This is a secret passed from High Chieftain to High Chieftain since the day Huln banished [[Deathwing]].}}

:''Upon interacting with the [[Highmountain Brazier]], visions of Huln Highmountain, [[Igrul the Scalebane]] and three large but unmoving [[stone dragon]]s appear.''
:{{text|say|Igrul the Scalebane|These eggs are corrupted. We should destroy them now.}}
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|There is more than one way to deal with corruption.}}
:''Huln lifts the [[Hammer of Khaz'goroth]] above his head and begins to purify some of the dragon eggs. However, the [[Obsidian Reclaimer]]s now begin to awaken one by one and attack Igrul and the player.''
:{{text|say|Igrul the Scalebane|The guardians, they are awaking!}}
:''After killing the first reclaimer:''
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|Not all of these eggs shall survive. But those that do should be free of Deathwing's corruption.}}
:''After killing the second one:''
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|Keep them off me just a little longer. One of the eggs is starting to hatch.}}
:''After killing the last reclaimer, a black dragon whelp named Ebyssian emerges from the egg.''
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|Look! One survived. Such a small thing, and with little black horns.}}
:''Huln kneels.''
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|I shall call you Ebonhorn.}}
:''The vision ends.''
:{{text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|So it was that Huln's mercy gained the allegiance of his family's oldest ally: me.}}
:''Ebonhorn transforms into a large, full-grown black dragon.''
:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|What? How? The whole time?!}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Mayla, I am still the same spiritwalker you have known your entire life. Know that regardless of what happens, I serve the High Chieftain.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Which gives me great honor to say this next part. Mayla Highmountain, I hereby pronounce you High Chieftain. Long may you stand!}}
