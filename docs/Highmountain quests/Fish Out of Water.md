==Objectives==
Return 8 [[Whitewater Carp (Highmountain)|Whitewater Carp]] to the river.
* Whitewater Carp returned to river (8)

==Description==
The [[drogbar]] are on a rampage! They're smashing everything they can find and are throwing fish to the shore.

Worst of all, it is the wrong time to harvest fish. They must be returned to the waters so they can breed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]
*[[Riverbend Netting]]

==Progress==
We used to supply the drogbar with most of their food between our fish and crops. What will the fools eat now?

==Completion==
Thank you. You saved enough fish that they can breed a new population.

==Notes==
It is possible to kick the fish in other directions, so make sure you are standing behind them and facing the water.

==Progression==
{{The Rivermane Tribe}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 11.2.7|note=Decor reward added.}}
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
