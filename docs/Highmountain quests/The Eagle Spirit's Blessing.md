==Objectives==
Receive the Eagle Spirit's blessing at [[Spiritwatch Point]] in [[Highmountain]].
*Fly to Spiritwatch Point
*Get back to Spiritwatch Point
*Kill [[Degar Bloodtotem]]
*Receive the Eagle Spirit's blessing

==Description==
[[Talonclaw|The spear]] is linked to a spirit called [[Ohn'ahra]]. It has been tradition for us to speak with her and receive her blessing before going after the spear. She may also impart some knowledge.

If you would accompany me to Spiritwatch Point, I will summon the Eagle Spirit and ask for its blessing in the coming fight.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40}}
*14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We've done it!

==Completion==
We saved the Eagle Spirit and received her blessing. I feel even more confident we will get Talonclaw now!

==Notes==
Upon mounting [[Highmountain Hippogryph]] standing next to Apata, you will be flown to [[Spiritwatch Point]] in [[Highmountain]]. Along the way, Apata will briefly describe the history of Talonclaw.

:{{text|say|Apata Highmountain|Let us be off. Follow me!}}
:{{text|yell|Apata Highmountain|Talonclaw has been lost for so long that many [[Highmountain tauren|tauren]] have never even laid eyes upon it. The elders still tell stories of how our greatest [[hunters]] wielded the spear in defense of our land.}}
:{{text|yell|Apata Highmountain|These heroes slew terrible monsters and fought off countless invaders. [[Dorro Highmountain]] was last to wield it. His end came at the claws of a corrupted [[nightsaber]] that preyed upon our villages.}}
:{{text|yell|Apata Highmountain|We called the beast [[Dakarr]]. A once noble creature, driven to madness by a deranged [[mystic vrykul|vrykul mystic]]. Dorro fought it off, then tracked the beast back to [[Stormheim]]. He never returned, and Talonclaw was never seen again.}}
:{{text|yell|Apata Highmountain|Every now and then, a brave hunter seeks Talonclaw. They commune with the Eagle Spirit, receive her blessing, and begin their hunt. Sadly, these pursuits have always ended the same way: death.}}
:''Upon approaching Spiritwatch Point, strange plant creatures appear and attack the village.''
:{{text|yell|Apata Highmountain|Something is wrong. There is strange... Look out!}}
:''Apata's hippogryph is pulled down towards the entrance of the [[Bartering Cave]] in an orb of green-tinged magic.''

The player's hippogryph continues flying north, eventually dropping them off. Head back south to Spiritwatch Point, filled with [[Twisted Lasher]]s, [[Weird Growth]]s, and [[Twisted Treeguard]]s, and enter the Bartering Cave, where Apata and Ohn'ahra are being held captive by Degar Bloodtotem.

:{{text|yell|Apata Highmountain|Why are you doing this? I know the peace has always been uneasy, but--}}
:{{text|say|Degar Bloodtotem|[[Highmountain Tribe|Your tribe]] had plenty of time to reclaim the spear, but failed. I will bring back Talonclaw... for the [[Bloodtotem tribe|Bloodtotem]]!}}
:{{text|say|Degar Bloodtotem|If only this stubborn spirit would obey!}}

On aggro:
:{{text|yell|Degar Bloodtotem|Another interloper? Do not meddle in Highmountain affairs!}}

Upon killing Degar, Apata and Ohn'ahra are freed.
:{{text|say|Apata Highmountain|Thank you. We could not allow my people's sacred heirloom to fall in the hands of such a monster!}}
:''Ohn'ahra flies out of the cave.''
:{{text|say|Apata Highmountain|There she goes! Ohn'ahra wants you to follow her.}}

Head out onto the Spiritwatch Point platform and interact with the Eagle Spirit to receive her blessing.
:{{text|say|Apata Highmountain|I am pleased Ohn'ahra gave her blessing. I feared the Bloodtotem's actions had angered her. Now we can depart for Stormheim!}}
