==Objectives==
Slay [[drogbar]] in the [[Bitestone Enclave]].
* [[Bitestone]] drogbar slain (5)
* [[Manaspine Basilisk]] slain (3)

==Description==
This is an old drogbar enclave that we used to trade with.  Now it is a base of operations for their raids.

I need more time to gather what is left of our warbraves.  Go, enter the enclave, and slay any you find in there.

Buy us the time we need to gather our strength.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
Highmountain stands!

==Completion==
Thank you for clearing us a path.  We should have a straight shot at [[Dargrul]] now.

==Notes==
If you take the higher path to the right you can kill your way to a treasure chest.

==Progression==
{{Riverbend}}

==Patch changes==
