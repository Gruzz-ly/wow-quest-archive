==Objectives==
Meet with [[Angler Creel]] in [[Whitewater Wash]].

==Description==
We can leave [[Farmer Maya]] in charge of the farmland now that the greatest threat has been reduced.

But we aren't out of hot water just yet, <name>. The fisheries are just as important as our fields, and they are in even greater danger than the farm if what Angler Creel says is true.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}} (at level 100)
*1,500 [[XP]] (at level 100)
*[[Dried Whitewash Corn]]

==Completion==
I'm glad you arrived when you did. The [[drogbar]] are increasing their aggression as we speak.

==Notes==
