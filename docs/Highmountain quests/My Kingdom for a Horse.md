==Objectives==
Return Maximillians horse

* Find [[Pimento]]
* Send Pimento Home

==Description==
Oh woe is me! Soon after making landfall I began exploring, riding my trusty steed Pimento into the heart of a demon infested village to the north. While performing my investigations, I tied Pimento up to go further on foot, only to return and discover a powerful demon had captured her! There he was, riding her like she was his own. Please find her and send her back to me.

==Completion==
Pimento!  You found him!

==Notes==
Search among the Swamprock murlocs of [[Shipwreck Cove]] for one that is riding on a horse. Kill that mob and then right-click on Pimento to send him home.
