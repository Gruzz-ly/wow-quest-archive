:{{text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|Once, upon returning from such a battle, Huln Highmountain found his people slaughtered by a previously unknown foe.}}
:{{text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|Battling his grief, Huln spoke with the leaders of the remaining tribes.  He convinced them to unite under one banner to oppose this new threat.}}
