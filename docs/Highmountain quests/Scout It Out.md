==Objectives==
Kill Irewing after sending up a flare, signaling his location.
* [[Irewing]] slain
* [[Flare Gun (Highmountain)]] (provided)

==Description==
You've proven that a [[gnome]] can shoot a rifle, and that's no easy feat, but a true test of [[Addie Fizzlebog|Addie]]'s skill will be to see if she can track down an elusive beast.

Rumor has it that a ravenous [[roc]] circles the basin, cursed by [[harpy]] [[magic]], but no one's seen the beast up close.

Take this flare, and shoot it into the sky once you've spotted the roc. When we see the signal, the huntin' party will rush in and help bring down that magnificent bird!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Lead-Studded Robes
|Lead-Studded Vest
|Lead-Studded Chestguard
|Lead-Studded Chestplate
|Pinerock Tracker's Amice
|Pinerock Tracker's Shoulderpads
|Pinerock Tracker's Shoulderguards
|Pinerock Tracker's Shoulderplates
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|38|80|}}
* 18,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Don't just stand there, head out into the basin and find that bird!

==Completion==
That was a kill I won't soon forget!

Addie will write the tale of our adventures here today, but not many will believe that a gnome [[hunter]] took down a beast ten times her size.

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|Hemet Nesingwary|That was an exhilarating kill, one that will make a fine chapter in my next novel.}}
:{{text|say|Addie Fizzlebog|That really was a noteworthy hunt! We should head back to camp while it's still fresh in my mind.}}
