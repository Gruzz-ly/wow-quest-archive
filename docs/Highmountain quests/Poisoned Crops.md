==Objectives==
Destroy the drogbar [[Poison Idol]]s.
* Poison Idol destroyed (4)

==Description==
After driving us from the farmland and infesting our crops with insects, the [[drogbar]] placed wicked totems that further poison our harvest.

I can only hope that if you destroy them, we'll be able to heal the land using [[Jale Rivermane|Jale]]'s water magic.

Thank you for coming to help us, <name>. We are but simple farmers and fishermen, and have little prowess in combat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|19|40|}}
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
The crops must be rid of this poison!

==Completion==
Thank you, <race>. Some of the crops still live. I believe with hard work and some of Jale's magical waters, we will not lose the entire harvest.

==Notes==
The cloud of poison from the idols will not harm you.

==Progression==
{{The Rivermane Tribe}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
