==Objectives==
Catch [[rabbit]]s in [[Sunfrost Glade]].
* [[Rabbit (item)]] (6)

==Description==
The howlers in these hills travel in packs. Three against one isn't a fight I want to pick.

Luckily those [[wolf|wolves]] are no match for my [[engineering]] skills! I just put the finishing touches on the prototype of a device that will help scatter the pack. All I need now is some ammo...

Snatch me some rabbits from the meadow south of here, and I'll let you be the first to try out the hand cannon.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
* 11,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you snatched the rabbits yet?

==Completion==
Hrm, these rabbits are a bit bigger than I thought, but we should still be able to stuff a few of them into the hand cannon.

==Progression==
