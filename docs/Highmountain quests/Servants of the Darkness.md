==Objectives==
Use the [[Water of Vision (Highmountain)|Water of Vision]] to walk in the memories of [[Huln Highmountain]].
*Water of Vision used
*[[Necrodark Defiler]] slain (10)
*[[Necrogg the Darkspeaker]] slain
*Snowmane Ward placed

==Description==
The heroes of [[Highmountain]]'s past placed wards to protect our land from the insidious [[Old God]]s. The deeds of these noble champions kept us safe for thousands of years.

We must not fail their memory.

Huln Highmountain himself placed the ward here at [[Snowblind Mesa]]. It must be reactivated for us to have any hope of saving [[Ebonhorn]].

Enter the echo of Huln's [[ghost|spirit]], and let his courage lead you to the location of this ward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
Huln battled the [[Necrodark]]?

There are so many tall tales attributed to Huln that I assumed those [[drogbar]] to be just another story. But it is clear they served the [[Uul'gyneth|Darkness]].

A troubling discovery... but there is no time to dwell on it now.
