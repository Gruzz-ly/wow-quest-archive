==Objectives==
Defend [[Malfurion Stormrage|Malfurion]].
* Defend Malfurion
* [[Wrathguard]] slain (25)

==Description==
[[Cenarius]] himself has risked much in coming here, if only briefly, to bestow a blessing upon you.  He has seen what you are capable of, and has chosen you as champion in this battle.  I would speak with you on this later.  It is a rare gift indeed.

But now, I ask for your help, [[Huln Highmountain]].  I must finish my incantations to allow [[dryad]]s from [[Emerald Dream|beyond the veil]] to enter this place and lend us their aid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
* 7,400 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
This shouldn't take long.  Please do not allow them to interrupt my spell.

==Completion==
The ritual is complete.  Reinforcements will be able to push through the portal and assist against the demonic hoard.
