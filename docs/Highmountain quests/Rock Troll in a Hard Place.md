==Objectives==
Speak with [[Navarrogg]] to meet him at a safe location.
* Speak with Navarrogg

==Description==
We should leave this place while we have a chance. The [[Bloodtotem tribe|Bloodtotem]] are amassing at their village to the north, and I believe they intend to kill my people.

Let me know when you are ready to go, and I can take us to a safe place quickly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}
* 1,500 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
You have little reason to trust me, but we have a common enemy in the Bloodtotem and I could use your help.

==Notes==
After accepting the quest, speak to Navarrogg again.
:I can get us out of here. I know a secret path.

:{{gossip|Let's get out of here!}}

A stone fist then rises up from the floor, encases both Navarrogg and the player and then submerges again, immediately transporting the player to [[Navarrogg's Refuge]].

==Progression==
{{The Bloodtotem Tribe}}
