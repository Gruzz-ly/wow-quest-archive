==Objectives==
Recover 10 Empowered Crystals.
* [[Empowered Crystal]] (10)

==Description==
The [[drogbar]] place their foul crystals in our cave to absorb the magic within, and then they collect them when they are saturated with power.

We must recover the crystals so the magic might dissipate and be suffused back into the waters, or else the drogbar will find ways to corrupt the magic to their own purposes.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
I believe the drogbar are learning strong magic now that they have possession of the [[:Hammer of Khaz'goroth]].

==Completion==
With the magic now spreading back into the cave, the balance of elements will be restored and the drogbar will not last long here.
