==Objectives==
Collect Worm Guts from [[Fledgling Rockcrawler]]s within Rockcrawler Chasm.
*[[Worm Guts]] (12)

==Description==
The [[drogbar]] use these caves as a place to train fledgling [[worm]]s.

The rockcrawlers are young and fairly weak, for now, but in time they will grow in size and strength. Without our intervention, the worms will morph into the monstrosities that the drogbar ride into battle.

Their guts are also known to be quite useful, and I have need of them. Two worms, one stone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
What are their guts for? Well, you'll see. You might not like it, but you will soon find out.

==Completion==
Those worm guts will be perfect for a special sort of rope.

==Progression==
