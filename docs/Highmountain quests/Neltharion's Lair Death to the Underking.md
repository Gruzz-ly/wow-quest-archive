==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Dargrul in Neltharion's Lair Cropped.jpg|Dargrul the Underking|He wields the stolen Hammer of Khaz'goroth.}}
Recover the Hammer of Khaz'goroth.
*Speak with [[Navarrogg]]
*[[Hammer of Khaz'goroth]]

==Description==
I will direct my people to clear a path through this rubble and assault [[Dargrul]]'s forces directly.

It will be a ruse.

Navarrogg proposed a plan that I believe has merit. He knows of a side entrance that might lead directly to Dargrul.

Muster what allies of yours you can and strike at them through this side passage. Recover the Hammer of Khaz'goroth before that villain brings the mountain down on top of us.

We will provide the distraction you need to get a shot.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|77|60}}
*29,600 [[XP]]
*+1000 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]
*[[Underking's Fist]]

==Progress==
The war continues. 

==Completion==
It was a hard fight, but necessary. <name>, on behalf of the Rivermane, the Skyhorn, the Stonedark, I thank you for your efforts.

But where one battle ends, another begins. When you stand against the coming of the Burning Legion, know that the tribes of Highmountain stand with you.

==Notes==
Talk to Navarrogg outside the instance portal:
{{dialogue|
This may seem like nothing more than a tiny hole that no army can fit down, but it leads to the very lair of [[Neltharion]] himself.

Within, you shall find yourself behind the main assault force of the drogbar loyal to Dargrul.

Proceed with caution though, as those you do find will be more formidable than the drogbar you have encountered thus far. Good luck, brul.}}

==Progression==
{{Battle of Snowblind Mesa}}
