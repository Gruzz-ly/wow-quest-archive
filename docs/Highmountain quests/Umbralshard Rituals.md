==Objectives==
* [[Enraged Umbralshard|Umbralshard Rituals stopped]] (3)

==Description==
: {{text|say|[[Jale Rivermane]]|I can hear the scream of the earth. The [[Greystone tribe|drogbar]] [[Greystone Shardmaster|shardmasters]] are performing a dark ritual that drives these crystal furies into a horrendous rage. The furies must be stopped before they cause untold damage to [[Thunder Totem]].}}

==Gains==
* +75 reputation with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
: {{text|say|Jale Rivermane|I don't even want to guess how much damage those enraged furies could have unleashed upon Thunder Totem if left unchecked.}}

==Notes==
Triggers at the [[Crystal Fissure]]. Up to three Greystone Shardmasters channel Crystalline Torment into an Enraged Umbralshard. Killing the drogbar will unleash the fury on you. There is one group outside the cave that provides a great example of what you're dealing with.

Also note that you'll also have to fight through [[Enraged Ambershard]]s.
