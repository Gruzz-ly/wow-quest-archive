==Objectives==
Slay 42 [[Coven (harpy)|Coven]] attackers.
*Coven Attacker slain (42)

==Description==
I received word that a coven of [[harpies]] and their [[roc]]s plan to attack in force. They'll be coming from the mountains to the north. Use one of the bolas launchers and I'll man the other. Quick!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
Let's show those harpies why they shouldn't even think about attacking Thunder Totem!

==Completion==
That was some nice work you did there, <name>. Thanks for the assist.

==Notes==
*Kill [[Coven Hag]]s and [[Coven Roc]]s.
