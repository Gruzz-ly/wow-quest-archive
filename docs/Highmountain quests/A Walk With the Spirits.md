==Objectives==
Speak with [[Spiritwalker Ebonhorn]].

==Description==
The spiritwalker you saved from [[Riverbend]] has been insufferable since his arrival. He is insisting on showing you the ways of our people so that you better understand what is to come.

He is a strange one, even by spiritwalker standards.

Even so, only a fool would discard his insight. Please, go to speak with him when you get a moment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}} (at level 100)
* 1,500 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
You made Mayla smile. That is the first time I have seen her smile in... ever?

==Progression==
{{Huln's War}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
