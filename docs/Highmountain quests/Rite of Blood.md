==Objectives==
Complete the Rite of Blood.
* Approach [[Navarrogg]] to Begin the Ritual
* Final Challenge Completed

==Description==
[[Oakin Ironbull]] vouches for you. He's capable, for a [[Rivermane tribe|Rivermane]]. You also brought with you proof of your own strength, albeit rather inconclusive proof.

Before we allow you to move freely within our territory, you must complete the Rite of Blood, which you have already begun. If you succeed--and I doubt you will--talk to me.

Enter the depths of the cave. Defeat whatever foe appears and return to me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Snowblind Legwraps
|Drogstitch Legguards
|Whitewater Leggings
|Thunderpeak Legguards
|Ironbull's Sacrifice
|Navarrogg's Guidance

You will also receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
Are you afraid of the dark?

==Completion==
Thank you for saving me. I hope now we can trust each other. We must if we are to defeat these Feltotem.

==Notes==
Upon accept:
:{{text|say|Torok Bloodtotem|Does such weakness pass as strength where you come from, <name>?}}

Upon entering the main chamber with Oakin:
:{{text|say|Oakin Ironbull|Something about this doesn't seem right.}}

Keep heading further inward across the stone bridge.
:{{text|say|[[Bloodtotem Warmonger]]|Ha! You're the one they sent? Good luck...}}
:{{text|say|Oakin Ironbull|I've got a bad feeling about this.}}

[[Navarrogg]] is being held captive in the center of the bone circle in the southern end of the cave. Upon approach:
:{{text|say|Navarrogg|Be... careful... this is a... trap...}}
:{{text|yell|Torok Bloodtotem|Hahahaha!}}
Suddenly, a demonic portal opens, and [[Marakhan]], an elite [[eredar|man'ari eredar]], emerges and kills Oakin!
:{{text|yell|Marakhan|More souls! Come and accept your fate!}}
:{{text|yell|Marakhan|Die!}}
:{{text|yell|Oakin Ironbull|Guuuaaaahhh!}}
Marakhan then proceeds to attack the player, but Navarrogg begins placing beneficial runes on the floor as well as calling in Stonedark reinforcements.
:{{text|say|Navarrogg|Hero, use this rune to empower yourself.}}

Upon killing Marakhan:
:{{text|yell|Torok Bloodtotem|A cheap trick, calling for reinforcements... You're unworthy of this mountain!}}

==Progression==
