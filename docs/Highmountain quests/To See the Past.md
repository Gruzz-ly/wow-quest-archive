==Objectives==
Collect a Bottle of Airspark, Musha's Tears, and Darkshard Crystal.
* [[Bottle of Airspark]]
* [[Mu'sha's Tears]]
* [[Darkshard Crystal]]

==Description==
I would like for you to experience firsthand what [[Huln Highmountain]] was able to accomplish in a single battle during the [[War of the Ancients]].

To do so, I will need very specific ingredients. They are not too difficult to obtain--you can find all of them near [[Thunder Totem]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
* 15,050 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
Earth, air, and water are all magics we have come to know well in our mountain.

==Completion==
Ah, these will be perfect for what is in store.

==Notes==
The Bottle of Airspark is purchased from [[Lanna Skyspark]] {{coords|35.5|23.6|Thunder_Totem}}, outside Thunder Totem.

Should you attempt the take the bottle beside her:
:{{text|say|Lanna Skyspark|It is customary in Highmountain to pay for goods. If you need Airspark, speak with me.}}

Musha's Tears {{coords|48.9|54.9|Thunder_Totem}} is at the bottom of a waterfall to the north of Thunder Totem, and far below the bridge to [[Crystal Fissure]]; do not jump from the bridge without slowfall.  You will have to clear out three [[Turbulent Lifefury]]s along the river, level 100-110 water elementals with 299,132 HP guarding the item, to get to or leave the spot.

* {{text|say|Turbulent Lifefury|Mu'sha's Tears are not for the mundane!}}
* {{text|say|Turbulent Lifefury|Do not disturb these waters!}}
* {{text|say|Turbulent Lifefury|This water is sacred!}}
* {{text|say|Turbulent Lifefury|The magic of this place is not yours to take!}}

[[Warbrave Nava]] up at Crystal Fissure has two optional quests you can do.


The Darkshard Crystal {{coords|45.2|53.5|Highmountain}} is further northwest of the river, in a short, narrow pass past where [[Sekhan]] wanders.  This is actually part of the [[Darkshard Crystal]] elemental sticking out of the ground; kill it to loot the item.
