== Objectives ==
* [[Hill Ettin]]s slain. (5)
* [[Hill Prince Morg]]/[[Hill Prince Urgo]]/[[Hill Prince Ruggu]] slain.

== Description ==
: {{text|say|[[Jale Rivermane]]|Those ettins are building a huge bonfire to cook and eat my tribesmen! You have to stop them!}}

== Rewards ==
* +250 reputation with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

== Completion ==
: {{text|say|Jale Rivermane|There will be no feast for the ettins this night. The [[Rivermane tribe|Rivermane]] thank you!}}

== Notes ==
Triggers at [[Path of Huln]] in [[Highmountain]]. This is generally considered difficult to complete at level and without raid gear, so it's generally best in such a case to get a party together.

Note that the ones with tree trunk clubs just melee, while the boulder throwers are ranged attackers.

One thing you can do to help your odds is to loot the [[Mammoth Skin Bag]]s lying around for [[Mammoth Milk]], which provides a quick HP-regeneration buff.

;Hill Prince slain
