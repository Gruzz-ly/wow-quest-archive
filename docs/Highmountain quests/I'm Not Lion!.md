==Objectives==
Collect a hunting trophy from [[Rashar|the lion]] that [[Ellias]] claims to have seen in [[Pinerock Basin]].
* [[Rashar's Right Eye]]
* Suggested players: 3

==Description==
I've hunted many exotic beasts in my day, but I've never seen a [[lion]] like the one I encountered while scouting the basin.

The beast's amber eyes locked on mine, luring me closer. I was helpless to this predator's enchanting gaze. It was only when the lion pounced did the stupor break.

I've told [[Hemet Nesingwary|Hemet]] of this magical beast, but he laughs. I'm not lying, <name>! The lion exists.

If you find the beast, bring me a trophy of your kill, and I'll reward you handsomely.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:
|q1=|Recipe: Salt and Pepper Shank
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|38|80|}}
* 18,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'll have the last laugh when Hemet sees proof that this magical lion exists!

==Completion==
So I was right! The lion with the amber eyes did exist.

Here's the gold as promised. This is worth every copper. You can't put a price on proving that you're right!

I'll keep this eye, but I wouldn't want the rest of our prize to go to waste. Let's eat!

==Notes==
[[Rashar]] is found in a cave at {{Coords|37.7|48.9|Highmountain}}
