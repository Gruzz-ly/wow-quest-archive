==Objectives==
Restore the Summit Ward.
*Place the Summit Ward

==Description==
The [[Necrodark]] are readying their ritual to give physical form to the [[Uul'gyneth|Darkness]]. They've sealed themselves inside and barred our way.

The shards you brought me should provide the means to bring down the barrier. Once it is done, we have to act quickly. We must restore the final ward before the Darkness can manifest.

Do not hesitate. The fate of [[Highmountain]] itself hangs in the balance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
This is the hardest challenge I have ever had to face.

==Completion==
We failed! The ward is shattered.

I sense the Darkness rising...

==Notes==
Upon accepting, Ebonhorn shatters the ice door with fire breath.
