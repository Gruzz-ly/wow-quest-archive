==Objectives==
Defeat [[Kuglaroth]].
* Kuglaroth slain

==Description==
The [[Feltotem tribe|Feltotem]] are not the first to embrace the temptations of the [[Burning Legion]]. And they will not be the last.

But in their arrogance, they have conjured a [[pit lord]].

Will you join us in battle against this beast? The power of your artifact and skill could prove invaluable against such a creature.

==Progress==
I do not need my eyes to see the value you bring to this war.

The other [[demon]]s we will contend with in time. But that pit lord, it was a creature of great evil and beyond our devices to defeat on our own. Your skills were appreciated.

==Trivia==
*This quest's name may be based on a scene in ''[[wikipedia:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' in which the fellowship comes under attack by orcs in the mines of Moria. Boromir hears a distinctive bellow outside the room where the fellowship is trapped, and remarks, "They have a cave troll."
