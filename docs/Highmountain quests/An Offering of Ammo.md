'''An Offering of Ammo''' is the western introduction quest to Hemet Nesingwary.  The eastern one is [[Rating Razik]].

==Objectives==
Deliver the Quiver of Arrows to [[Hemet Nesingwary]] at [[Nesingwary's Retreat]].
* [[Quiver of Arrows]] (provided)

==Description==
The mountains have seen many new travelers pass through their valleys, some without an understanding of our traditions.

Our leaders have turned their focus to more pressing matters, but [[Losro Greyfeather|Losro]] and I cannot ignore the recent arrival of hunters in the nearby basin.

They hunt with guns and gadgets, forgoing the experience of hunting with a bow and arrow.

While I know that some will remain stuck in their ways, perhaps an offering of arrows will encourage these outsiders to hunt the way we always have.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|66}} (at level 103)
* 1,705 [[XP]] (at level 103)

==Completion==
We gave up usin' that kind of ammo long ago!  Don't worry though, we won't let the gift go to waste.  I'm sure we can use the arrows for kindling.

==Notes==
To get this quest, you will have to finish one of the contact questlines for the Bloodtotem or the Skyhorn from [[Mayla Highmountain]].

==Progression==
