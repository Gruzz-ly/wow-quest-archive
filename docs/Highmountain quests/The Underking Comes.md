==Objectives==
Evacuate [[Riverbend]].
* [[Rivermane Tauren]] evacuated (10)

==Description==
Here, I'm too slow to get these laggards to safety. Take my horn and sound the evacuation.

We need to get the people out of here before the [[drogbar]] arrive. The [[warbrave]]s can take it from there.

For now just send them over to [[Spiritwalker Ebonhorn]]. That fool can watch over them until it is safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
* 15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
Well, this is an unexpected pleasure.

==Completion==
[[Dargrul|The Underking]] is coming. Best keep that weapon of yours handy in case this does not go well.

==Notes==
The Horn of Jale extra action button becomes available. Use it near Rivermane Tauren.

;Rivermane Tauren gossip
*So, you are the one Ebonhorn has been talking about?

:It was a strange prophecy from a strange spiritwalker.

:Too strange, if you ask me.
*Did you hear? The High-Chieftain is dead!

:The drogbar underking betrayed him.
*Jale is going to try to negotiate with the drogbar. Without the help of the other tribes, we have no choice but to try for peace.
*I heard the drogbar have already begun attacking Whitewater Wash and even Thunder Totem.

:These are dark days.
