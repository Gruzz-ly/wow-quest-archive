==Objectives==
Recover the ancient necklace and bring it back to [[Lessah Moonwater|Lessah]].
* [[Ancient Highmountain Necklace]]

==Description==
According to my research and the information you gave me, I've isolated the location of the necklace.

It's deep in a [[drogbar]] cave, and I'm willing to bet they're not just going to hand it over to you, <name>.

I need you to recover that necklace at any cost.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Prizerock Neckband]]

==Progress==
If only the drogbar were more reasonable.

==Completion==
<Lessah examines the necklace.>

How can this be?! All my research suggested that this belonged to [[Huln Highmountain|Huln]].

I'm sorry, <name>, but this necklace is a creation of the drogbar. I'll give it back to you to do with it what you want. 

==Notes==
Travel to [[Whitewater Wash]], north of [[Riverbend]], and go inside the [[Lifespring Cavern]]. Once you reach the first fork, go right and follow the path as it circles upward (you should see some wooden beams on the ground). When you enter the main area, take the path on the left and slay [[Gelmogg]] to loot the [[Ancient Highmountain Necklace]].
