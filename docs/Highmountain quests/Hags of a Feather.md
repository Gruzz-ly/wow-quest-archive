==Objectives==
Collect 50 Hag Feathers from Witchwood Hags in the [[Witchwood]].
* [[Hag Feather]] (50)

==Description==
The [[drogbar]] you freed me from were unusually aggressive. The tribe in the nearby caves seems to be apart from the rest of them, but that didn't stop the [[Bloodtotem tribe|Bloodtotem]] from going on the offensive just in case, capturing some of their number.

That move left the woods exposed to the [[harpy|harpies]], however. Your help dealing with these witches would not go unnoticed by [[Torok Bloodtotem|Torok]]. Bring back their feathers as proof of death.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
Your size belies your strength, <name>.

==Completion==
I could hear them screeching from here. With this victory and the defeat of the Witch of the Wood, Torok will surely be willing to see you.

==Progression==
{{The Bloodtotem Tribe}}
