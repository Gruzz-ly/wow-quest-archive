==Objectives==
Complete 20 successful surveys with Luron present.
* Speak with [[Luron]]
* [[Archaeologist's Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
The reason I sent for someone was that I've been having trouble keeping up with my research and training my assistant.

I was hoping you might be able to show him the ropes again. Get him reacquainted with surveying.

Just speak with him when you're ready to go.

==Progress==
Is Luron keeping up with you? He is a good student... but you are an accomplished archaeologist.

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, <name>. Now perhaps you can help me with my research.

==Notes==
;Accept:
: {{text|say|Lessah Moonwater|Speak with Luron when you're ready to begin your lessons.}}

With nine fragments at each site, this will take two dig sites and two more surveys. Don't forget to use the whistle first so Luron can be present when the fragments are found.

;As fragments are progressively uncovered
* {{text|say|Luron|Ooh, what is that ?}}{{sic}}
* {{text|say|Luron|Ah yes, now I remember.}}
* {{text|say|Luron|Lessah is a good teacher, but you are even better!}}
* {{text|say|Luron|Aha! There it is!}}
