==Objectives==
Fetch Maximillians armor.

* [[Spaulders of Hugeness]]
* [[Pants of Wonderment]]
* [[Boots of Kicking]]
* [[Gauntless of Huge Grapsing]]

==Description==
Amidst the squalls and the crashing waves, my mighty ship swayed and tumbled. Lesser knights would have trembled in terror, frozen stiff. Not me! Nay! Heroically, I stripped my armor off my back and stored it safely in my sack.

Why did I strip down to these simple undergarments you ask? As only an ignorant squire would. I was wary of sinking to the bottom should my ship fall foul of course! Ha ha!

Unfortunately the sacks of armor were thrown overboard by the waves.

==Progress==
Fetch Maximillians armor.

==Completion==
Excellent, you found my armor.

==Notes==
Look for any [[Sack of Armor]] laying in the coastal waters.
