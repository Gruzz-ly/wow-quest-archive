'''The Lone Mountain''' begins the [[Highmountain storyline]]. The quest is automatically acquired when players choose Highmountain from their Command Map in their [[order hall]]. Like the other three leveling zones, all enemies, quests, treasures, and so forth in Highmountain will scale to the level of the player.

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Warbrave Oro]] at [[Krasus' Landing]] in [[Dalaran]].

==Description==
Our sources tell us that a [[Highmountain tauren]] emissary has recently arrived in Dalaran. We don't know his intentions, but his people could be an invaluable contact in the region.

[[Khadgar]] is greeting the emissary at Krasus' Landing in Dalaran - you should seek him out.

The [[Kirin Tor]] mages have created a permanent portal for us that can take you to the city quickly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}
*1,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Greetings champion. I am Warbrave Oro of the Highmountain tauren. I come on the winds of war to find you.

==Notes==
