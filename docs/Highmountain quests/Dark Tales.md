==Objectives==
Meet [[Spiritwalker Graysky]] in [[Riverbend]].

==Description==
[[Spiritwalker Ebonhorn]] is stable... for now.

He once told me of the wards he maintains against the [[Old God]]s. He placed them at key locations around this mountain, but kept them hidden from mortal eyes--even my own.

Incapacitated like this, his wards cannot hold back the evil ones. No doubt this is the reason for their attack.

To find the wards, we must enter the echoes of Ebonhorn's past and commune with the [[ghost|spirits]] we find there.

Meet me in Riverbend, <name>. It is there our search begins.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
The spirits hold many truths, <name>.

Walking in their footsteps may reveal the locations of Ebonhorn's wards.

==Notes==
Upon accepting, Graysky leaves.

==Progression==
{{Highmountain Horde}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
