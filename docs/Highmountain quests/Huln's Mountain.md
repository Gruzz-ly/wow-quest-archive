==Objectives==
Meet [[Spiritwalker Graysky]] at [[Snowblind Mesa]].

==Description==
We have made progress reactivating the wards, but more must be done.

I sense [[Ebonhorn]]'s struggle. Though he fights with all his strength, he is slipping away. Should this "[[Uul'gyneth|Darkness]]" emerge into our realm, I fear our friend will be lost.

Ebonhorn spoke of another ward somewhere within Snowblind Mesa. Meet me there, so that I might guide you along another journey into the memories of the past.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +75 reputation with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
Do you sense it, <name>? Such strength... such courage.

The echo of [[Huln Highmountain]]'s spirit is all around us.

==Progression==
{{Highmountain Horde}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.3.5|note=Added.}}
