==Objectives==
Find [[Navarrogg]]'s pets.
* Rescue [[Shard (elemental)|Shard]]
* Rescue [[Gravel]]
* Rescue [[Frag]]

==Description==
I raise creatures born of the earth to help defend myself and my people. When I was captured, I ordered them to stay behind at our home, but they are often disobedient and likely tried to follow me.

If they did, I fear the [[Bloodtotem tribe|Bloodtotem]] may have captured them, or worse. In my current state, I can't muster the strength to find them. If you find them, it would be much appreciated.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
These beasts are not terribly bright, but they are loyal in their way.

==Completion==
Frag has fallen? The youngest of my pets was perhaps my most dear...curse the Bloodtotem and their cruelty!

==Notes==
Frag is found lying dead on an island in the middle of small lake at {{coords|45.3|27.6|Highmountain}}. Upon attempting to resuscitate the shardling, the following message is seen:
:{{text|yell|[[Torok Bloodtotem]]|Pity... that wretched shardling isn't moving? Its death was neither quick nor painless, I assure you.}}

Gravel is located at {{coords|43.5|33.7|Highmountain}}.

Finally, Shard is found at {{coords|43.5|28.4|Highmountain}}.

==Progression==
{{The Bloodtotem Tribe}}
