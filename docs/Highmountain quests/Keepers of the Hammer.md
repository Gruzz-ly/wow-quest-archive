==Objectives==
Meet [[Mayla Highmountain]] at [[Thunder Totem]] in [[Highmountain]].
* Fly to Thunder Totem in Highmountain
* Meet [[Warbrave Oro]] at Thunder Totem

==Description==
The [[Highmountain]] Tribes had intended to pledge our allegiance to your forces. We know war has come with the [[Burning Legion]].

However, we have been betrayed from within and must now ask for your aid.

A great relic, the [[Hammer of Khaz'goroth]], was stolen from our people by the vile [[drogbar]].

We need your help in recovering it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}}
*1,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I know you seek the [[Pillar of Creation]] but I am sad to say it was one of many things we lost today.

==Notes==
''Accept:''
:{{text|say|Warbrave Oro|Come champion. Journey with me and I shall show you the might of Highmountain.}}
: ''Oro walks toward [[Aludane Whitecloud]].''
:{{text|say|Archmage Khadgar|<Name>, the warbrave has good intentions - I think. Quickly, now, after him - his people are your best chance at an ally on that mountain.}}
: ''Khadgar switches to raven form and heads back into Dalaran and Oro gets a [[Great Eagle]] for his flightpath.''

: ''Landing at Thunder Totem, Oro is waiting for your arrival.  After greeting you he guides you to a tauren elevator as he continues speaking.''
:{{text|say|Warbrave Oro|Welcome, champion, to Thunder Totem. In better days we would have warriors from the [[Bloodtotem tribe]] or eagle riders from the [[Skyhorn tribe]]. Today, we are so few we could barely keep a [[kobold]] out.}}
: ''He stops by the elevator and gestures to it.''
:{{text|say|Warbrave Oro|This platform will take you into the sacred [[Hall of Chieftains]] where Mayla Highmountain awaits you.}}

''Approaching Mayla:''
:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|I am Mayla, daughter of the late High Chieftain [[Ulan Highmountain|Ulan]], and I... I speak for the tribes.}}

Meet the High-Chieftain at Thunder Totem in Highmountain.

;Description
[[Ulan Highmountain|High Chieftain Ulan]] has requested your presence.

We have learned that the Burning Legion has returned and know that if you are true in your purpose in facing this evil, you will need our aid.

Our people have in our possession a great titan relic: the Hammer of Khaz'goroth.

We intend to lend it to you for this task.

When you are ready, join me at our stronghold of Thunder Totem in Highmountain.
