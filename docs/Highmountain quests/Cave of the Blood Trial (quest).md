==Objectives==
Place the [[Witch of the Wood]]'s carcass on the altar and defeat a Warmonger in single combat.
* Harpy Placed on Altar
* [[Bloodtotem Warmonger]] defeated

==Description==
All [[Bloodtotem tribe|Bloodtotem]] and distinguished guests must go through a trial of blood in the cavern beneath this outpost.

I hope it's a good sign that they wish you to participate in this rite of passage. You will need to show proof of your deeds, defeat a Warmonger in single combat, then perform sacrifice at an altar deep in the cavern.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
Are you afraid of the dark?

==Completion==
They said an outsider would wield the [[:Hammer of Khaz'goroth]]. I doubt you could even lift it.

==Notes==
Upon accept, Oakin heads down to the [[Cave of the Blood Trial]].
:{{text|say|Oakin Ironbull|Meet me in the cavern below, <name>. They'll want to see the corpse of the [[harpy]] you slew.}}

A [[Bloodtotem Trapper]] and [[Bloodtotem Warmonger]] are standing outside the cave's entrance.
:{{text|say|Bloodtotem Trapper|What must we give in return?}}
:{{text|yell|Bloodtotem Warmonger|Everything!}}
:{{text|say|Bloodtotem Trapper|I guess that isn't so bad...}}
This is a callback to the ''[[World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor|Warlords of Draenor]]'' opening cinematic, where almost the same exchange (minus the last part) occurs between {{Au|Grommash Hellscream}} and {{Au|Gul'dan}}.

Continue heading down into the cave:
:{{text|say|Oakin Ironbull|<Name> is here to meet with Torok. <She/He> slew the [[Witch of the Wood]].}}
Upon placing the harpy corpse on the altar, another Bloodtotem Warmonger appears.
:{{text|yell|Bloodtotem Warmonger|A challenger? Let's see what this one is capable of!}}
Upon defeating the warmonger:
:{{text|yell|Torok Bloodtotem|He went easy on you, outsider. Come, speak.}}

==Progression==
{{The Bloodtotem Tribe}}
