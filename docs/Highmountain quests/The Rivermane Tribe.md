==Objectives==
Meet [[Jale Rivermane]] at [[Earthmother's Bounty]].

==Description==
What has happened here requires more time than I have to explain. In short, our [[tribe]]s have scattered in the wake of the attack that left the [[:Hammer of Khaz'goroth]] in the hands of the barbaric [[drogbar]].

Even now the drogbar are raiding the [[Rivermane tribe]], and I have too few braves left to send to their aid.

We need a hero. Please, go to Earthmother's Bounty and lend what aid you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|54}} (at level 100)
*1,500 [[XP]] (at level 100)

==Completion==
[[Mayla Highmountain|Mayla]] was still able to send help? I could hug that child.

Welcome, outsider. I am [[Jale Rivermane]], [[Chieftain]] of the Rivermane tribe. And we could really use your help.
