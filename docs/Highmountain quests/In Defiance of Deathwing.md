*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
And so it was that Huln Highmountain came to this mountain, freeing the [[drogbar]] [[slave]]s of Deathwing, and came into possession of the [[:Hammer of Khaz'goroth]].

==Notes==
Click on [[Highmountain Brazier]]s.

;Vision of Scales
:''A vision of [[Igrul the Scalebane]], Huln Highmountain, and [[Ancestral Warbrave]]s appear.''
:{{text|say|Igrul the Scalebane|Bah. My people did not make this [[goblin]] trash. We only strapped it to that wyrm's hide. No weapon of mortal make can penetrate these metal plates.}}
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|Then we must find weapons not made by mortals. Igrul, is there any tool or trinket that Deathwing kept from your people? Something he would not trust for you to touch?}}
:{{text|say|Igrul the Scalebane|Hmmm. I may know of something...}}

;Vision of the Hammer
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|[[Titan Waygate|This]] is a [[titan]] waygate. What lies beyond?}}
:{{text|say|Igrul the Scalebane|[[Hammer of Khaz'goroth|A hammer]]. [[Deathwing]] eats any of my people who get near it.}}

;Vision of Hope
:{{text|say|Igrul the Scalebane|Enough stalling. We must slay the beast and set my people free.}}
:{{text|say|Huln Highmountain|Both the hammer and Deathwing were tools of the titans. I doubt I could kill him, but I may be able to banish him.}}

;Objectives
Investigate 3 Time Scars.
*Temporal Fissure investigated (3)

;Description
It was in this place ages ago that Huln Highmountain challenged the great Deathwing.

The power wielded in that battle was so great it left scars in time itself, much like the ones you saw on our way in here.

Echoes of those here on that fateful day still drift forward, sharing their story with us today.

But be careful exploring these scars, for the echoes might get a glimpse of you. And they are still quite dangerous.

;Progress
These fissures in time are quire engaging. I have been trying to study them for some time now.

;Completion
After long study of these echoes, I believe it might be possible for one skilled in magic to bring such an echo forward to our time.

But such an act should only be used in the most dire of situations.
