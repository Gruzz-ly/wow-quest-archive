==Objectives==
Repel the [[Burning Legion]] forces throughout [[Highmountain]].
*Legion Points repelled (4)

==Description==
In my years I have seen disturbances and threats come and go, but never before have I seen such brazen disregard for life.

The [[demon]]s may scorch our lands and cause suffering amongst our kin, but we must not stand idly by while they threaten what we have fought so hard to create.

Rise to the occasion, <name>. The time has come to stand against the Burning Legion!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|14|60|}}
*12,340 [[XP]]
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
My apologies, <name>. I hope Aviash and I did not offend you. One cannot be too careful during times like these.
