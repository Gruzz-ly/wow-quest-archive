==Objectives==
Investigate [[Navarrogg]]'s suspicions.
* Investigate the Bloodtotem

==Description==
You have no reason to trust me. My cousins led by [[Dargrul the Underking|Dargrul]] have gone mad with power.

But I ask you to investigate something. I have a feeling something terrible is about to befall [[Highmountain]], and that [[Torok Bloodtotem|Torok]] and his [[Bloodtotem tribe|Bloodtotem]] are going to be responsible.

If you don't believe me, look for yourself at the northern side of [[Cliff's Edge]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
<The cage is empty. Navarrogg is gone.>

==Notes==
Head to {{coords|39.00|34.83|Highmountain}} to find three [[Highmountain tauren|tauren]] laying dead around a table with a [[Cup]] of [[fel]] liquid. Upon clicking on the cup, a [[Bloodtotem Warmonger]] rushes out of the nearby building and knocks you back, yelling:
:{{text|yell|Get away from that, outsider!}}

==Progression==
{{The Bloodtotem Tribe}}
