==Objectives==
Save 5 [[Captive Great Eagle]]s.
* Captive Great Eagle rescued (5)

==Description==
[[High Crawliac]] has taught her witches how to curse our beloved eagles into the [[Fleshrender Roc|vile roc]]s you see assaulting the valley.

There is no way to break this curse once it has taken hold.

We will take to the skies and do battle with the rocs, but we need your help on the ground.

Head north through [[Darkfeather Valley]] and release any eagles that you find.

Every eagle you save is one less roc we must kill later.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
Your bravery has returned to us some of our fine feathered friends. Well done.

Now how do you feel about a frontal assault?
