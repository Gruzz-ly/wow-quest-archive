==Objectives==
Slay 10 Feltotem Tauren.
* Feltotem slain (10)

==Description==
The tauren go too far. I did not escape their outpost for fear that they would attack the cave and slaughter my people.

It looks like they planned to do it all along. Slay some of the [[Bloodtotem tribe|Feltotem]]. Thin the herd.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
These tauren have always been bloodthirsty. The [[Highmountain Tribe|Highmountain]] chieftain has barely been able to stop them killing{{sic}} all of us.

==Completion==
Their numbers are fewer, but still they threaten our safety.

==Notes==
Upon killing all 10 Feltotem tauren:
:{{text|yell|[[Torok Bloodtotem]]|You defeated a few of our weakest fighters... no matter. When the fel blood courses fully through our veins, even that precious [[artifact]] of yours won't do us harm.}}

{{The Bloodtotem Tribe}}
