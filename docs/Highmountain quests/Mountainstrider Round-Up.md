==Objectives==
Find 3 [[Frightened Mountainstrider]]s and return them to [[Liza Galestride]]'s stable.
*Frightened Mountainstrider returned (3)

==Description==
Stranger! You are the one I have heard of?

When the kerfuffle with the [[drogbar]] happened, some of the young [[moose]] ran off!

I can't chase them down or the others might wander off as well.

Could you bring them back here?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*14,800 [[XP]] (at level 100)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
The moose are already broken. Just hop in the saddle and you can bring them here to me!

==Completion==
Thank you, friend to Highmountain.

==Notes==
If the moose happens to be pointed towards a cliff, make sure to turn it around the moment you take control, as it will start galloping right away.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=Added.}}
