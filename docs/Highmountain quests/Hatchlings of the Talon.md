Greetings, hatchling. Do you wish to soar amongst the clouds as my children do?

<Aviana chuckles - a clicking, crow-like noise.>

Very well, receive my blessing and we shall see how well developed your wings are.

You will receive:
*14,800 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Dreamweavers]]

==Completion==
<You feel the warmth of Aviana's blessing once more. You have earned the [[Ancient Guardian|ancient]]'s respect.>
