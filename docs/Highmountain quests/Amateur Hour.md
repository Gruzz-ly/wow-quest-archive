==Objectives==
Confront Amateur Hunters within [[Pinerock Basin]].
* [[Amateur Hunter]]s confronted (4)

==Description==
The hunters' lodge has attracted a lot of amateurs who call themselves [[hunter]]s. They're scarin' away all the prize game with their antics.

While I'm a known expert with my rifle, I've yet to manage the art of negotiation.

How about ya do us all a favor and tell those novice hunters to head for the hills?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have those amateur hunters scattered? Don't be afraid to use your fists if words don§t do the job.

==Completion==
Ya seem to have a gift when it comes to dealin' with amateurs. Maybe ya can help my ghostwriter, [[Addie Fizzlebog|Addie]]?

I've promised to teach her how to hunt, but I don't have time to show her the basics.

==Notes==
;Speaking with the Amateur Hunters
:{{Gossip|Go hunt somewhere else!}}

This may either cause the hunter to leave peacefully...
*{{text|say|I was just about to leave, anyway.}}
*{{text|say|You can have this spot. I'll find a better one.}}
*{{text|say|You don't have to ask me twice.}}

... or they may become {{rep|hostile}} and attack the player.
*{{text|say|I think you're the one that should be leaving!}}
*{{text|say|I'll hunt where I want, and you won't stop me!}}
*{{text|say|No one tells me what to do!}}
*{{text|say|You'll regret telling me to leave!}}

After damaging them a sufficient amount, however, they turn back to {{rep|neutral}} and run away.
*{{text|say|Fine, you win! I'll find a better place to hunt.}}
*{{text|say|Okay, okay! I give up. I'll go hunt somewhere else.}}
