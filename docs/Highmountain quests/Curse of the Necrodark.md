==Objectives==
Journey to [[Highmountain Summit]].

==Description==
It is clear that the [[Old God]]s have long sought to control [[Highmountain]]. Their covetous desire speaks to the power of this land, and the strength of the [[ghost|spirits]] that echo through its peaks and valleys.

They will not take our sacred mountain, <name>. Not while I draw breath.

With the [[Highmountain Tribe|Highmountain tribes]] united, and with [[Baine Bloodhoof]] at our side, we will defeat the [[Uul'gyneth|Darkness]]... once and for all.

Come. Let us take back the summit from the forces that would corrupt it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Completion==
[[Mayla]] charged ahead with [[Ebonhorn]]. Now they're cut off from the rest of us.

This is bad, <name>.

==Notes==
:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|Long ago, the Old Gods sought to claim Highmountain. Their campaign was led by a terrible creature of nightmare… [[Uul'gyneth|Uul'gyneth the Darkness]].}}
:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|[[Huln Highmountain|Huln]] gathered heroes from among the [[tribe]]s. They fought against Uul'gyneth's servants, the [[Necrodark]]… but the forces of [[shadow]] were too great to overcome.}}
:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|So Huln devised another plan. Wards were placed to lock away the Old Gods' influence. Though the general survived, Uul'gyneth's essence was trapped.}}
:{{Text|say|Mayla Highmountain|All this time, the Necrodark have been lurking in the shadows, waiting to call forth their master.}}
:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|Indeed. And when I left the mountain to visit [[Mulgore]], the wards weakened just enough to let the Darkness seep through.}}
:{{Text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|The last ward was placed at Highmountain Summit. That is where we must go. Just as Huln stood with his allies, so we must band together.}}

[[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]], Mayla, and Ebonhorn leave. [[Lasan Skyhorn]], [[Aviash]], and [[Jale Rivermane]] join them on Highmountain Summit.
