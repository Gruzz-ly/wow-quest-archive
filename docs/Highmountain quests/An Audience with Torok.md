==Objectives==
Speak with [[Torok Bloodtotem]].
* Meet Torok Bloodtotem

==Description==
I should warn you that Torok is easily displeased and is hateful of outsiders. Be on your guard.

We will seek an audience with him at his tent at the [[Cliff's Edge]]. As the [[Rivermane tribe|Rivermane]] Emissary here, I am afforded some protection against aggression, but they have made no such promises about you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
I just hope the Bloodtotem don't cut us down for demanding their chieftain's time.

==Completion==
Strange that he would be in the cavern at this time... perhaps this is a good sign?

==Notes==
Follow Oakin until he stops in front of a hut in the northwestern part of Cliff's Edge.
