==Objectives==
Weaken [[demon]]s so [[Apprentice Rosalyn]] can trap them within a [[Soul Chamber|soul chamber]].
*[[Ezerak]] detained
*[[Lozar]] detained
*[[Xorias]] detained

==Description==
The demons that escaped must be detained. Killing them is not an option. [[Soulkeeper Uriah|Uriah]] was entrusted to deliver the prisoners to [[Allari the Souleater|Allari]] for interrogation, and I will not let him fail.

I've seen Uriah trap many demons. It seems... complicated, but I think I can pull it off. I'll just need you to subdue them first.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Warmth of Uriah
|Solace of Uriah
|Courage of Uriah
|Snowblind Waistwrap
|Drogstitch Girdle
|Whitewater Links
|Thunderpeak Greatbelt
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||20|}}
*1,400 [[XP]]
*14,800 [[XP]] (level 100)

==Progress==
You must weaken the demons so I am able to trap them.

==Completion==
Thank you for your help, <name>. I will honor Uriah's memory by completing our journey to [[Azsuna]] and delivering the demon prisoners to Allari as planned.

==Notes==
Upon accepting the quest, you will be given the "Rosalyn Is Near" buff, which causes Apprentice Rosalyn to follow you around the [[Mucksnout Den]] and aid you in combat.

:{{text|say|Apprentice Rosalyn|Together we will imprison these demons once again.}}

In order to allow Rosalyn to detain the demons, you will need to bring them down to around 30% health, at which point they become stunned by Rosalyn's "Detainment" spell.
:{{text|say|Apprentice Rosalyn|The demon is weak enough for me to begin the containment spell. This should only take a moment.}}
Upon finishing the spell:
:{{text|say|Apprentice Rosalyn|The demon has been secured.}}
Note that the demons cannot be reduced below 1% health as long as you are accompanied by Rosalyn.

Lozar, an [[imp]], can be found wandering around in the southwesternmost corner of the cave, close to the starting point for the quest. {{coords|38.8|45.6|Highmountain}}
:{{text|say|Lozar|You'll never get me back into that crystal!}}

Next, head north across the wooden bridge.
:{{text|say|Apprentice Rosalyn|I can sense a demon presence... Above us, <name>, on the ledge!}}
Cross the bridge and then follow the western ledge to the top, where the [[doomguard]] Xorias can be found standing in a lava pool. {{coords|41|41|Highmountain}}
:{{text|say|Xorias|I will not be contained!}}

Finally, head to the northernmost part of the den, where the [[wrathguard]] Ezerak can be found standing in front of several large fel rock formations. {{coords|41.4|38.6|Highmountain}}
:{{text|say|Ezerak|You don't have the power to stop me!}}

After completing the quest, Rosalyn runs off into the distance on her [[hawkstrider]] mount and permanently disappears from the cave.
:{{text|say|Apprentice Rosalyn|Safe travels, <name>.}}
