==Objectives==
Slay 8 [[murloc]]s in [[Stonedark Cavern]].
* [[Deepcavern Murloc]] slain (8)

==Description==
We're getting tired of those murlocs. They skitter around the cavern like they own it. They stole some of [[Stonedark clan|our]] most precious relics and got their fishy fins all over them.

Kill a few of them so they know they don't run things around here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
* 7,400 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
Slippery little critters, aren't they?

==Completion==
I could hear their murlurulurls echoing in the cavern. Maybe they'll think twice before taking our stuff next time.

==Progression==
{{You Lift, Brul?}}

==Patch changes==
