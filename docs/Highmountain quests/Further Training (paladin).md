==Description==
The journey here was perilous Squire. It was fraught with danger. Storms, demons, storm demons... I shudder at the memory. Of course, I overcame all such dangers, at great loss to my person. This is where I need your assistance.

You must venture forth, nay, sally forth, and recover my armor, my weapon, and of course my grand steed. Once you have successfully completed these tasks three, will you be promoted to Squire, First Class!

Very good, Squire- First Class!  Now the real journey begins!
