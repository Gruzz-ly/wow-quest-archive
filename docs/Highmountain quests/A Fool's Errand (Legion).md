==Objectives==
Kill "Hill Bandits" to find Doloria's stolen "Jewelry" and buy her "release"
* [["Jewelry"]]
* Return to the Lounge

==Description==
Oh yea sure, I'm, um, held here against my, you know, will, or something.

Look bud, between you and me old [[Maximillian of Northshire|Max]] here has no chance, but his heart is in the right place. I keep trying to run away and hide but he keeps finding me! I just don't have it in me to upset him with the truth.

I've got an idea. Why don't you go kill some of those really big two headed "Hill Bandits" for me. Let's say they stole some jewelery from me, and you can use it to buy my freedom.

Take your time, don't get hurt. Much.

==Progress==
Kill "Hill Bandits" to find Dolorias stolen "Jewelry" and buy her "release"

==Completion==
<Doloria gives you a sly wink from behind her mask>

Uh, no, haven't seen her for a few days, not sure who you're talking about.

==Notes==
Take the flight path to [[Sylvan Falls]] and kill [[Hill Ettin]]s until the quest item drops. Return to Dalaran.
