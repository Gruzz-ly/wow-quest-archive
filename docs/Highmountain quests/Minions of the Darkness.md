==Objectives==
Use the [[Water of Vision (Highmountain)|Water of Vision]] to walk in the memories of [[Oenia Skyhorn]].
*Water of Vision used
*[[Dark Spirit]] slain (12)
*[[Shadowy Tendril]] slain (6)
*[[Shadow of the Darkness]] slain (1)
*Sepulcher Ward placed

==Description==
Oenia Skyhorn was a legendary [[chieftain]] of her [[Skyhorn tribe|tribe]]. Though she crossed over to the [[Veil|spirit realm]] long ago, her presence is still felt all around us.

[[Ebonhorn]] told me that Oenia placed a ward here to protect the people she cared for so deeply... perhaps from the specter of the [[Uul'gyneth|Darkness]].

Use the Water of Vision to journey into her echoes. Worry not that this ritual might disturb her rest. A hero like Oenia would relish a chance to aid us in the present.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 16,450 [[XP]]
* +250 reputation with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
The spirits speak of the Darkness. A great danger rises, <name>.

==Completion==
These shadows of the spirit realm grow stronger. I fear they may soon pierce the veil into our reality.

I pray restoring the wards will set things right.

==Notes==
:{{Text|yell|Oenia Skyhorn|Begone, spirits! Tell the Darkness he is not welcome in this place!}}

The Shadow of the Darkness summons [[Fragment of Uul|Fragments of Uul]] and [[Tendril of Uul|Tendrils of Uul]].
