==Objectives==
Hunt Pinerock Stalkers and Prowlers in [[Pinerock Basin]].
* [[Pinerock Prowler]]s and [[Pinerock Stalker]]s slain (10)

==Description==
The hills are crawlin' with [[lion]]s that stalk their prey from afar. These big cats will pounce at anything that catches their eye, including a <race>.

While most would fall to such a formidable predator, anyone in my huntin' party would be able to best those beasts.

Prove you've got what it takes by taking down a few of those stalkers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|40|}}
* 14,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Anyone worthy of huntin' in these hills should be able to take down a few stalkers.

==Completion==
Not a scratch on ya that I can see. I bet those lions never saw ya comin'!

==Progression==
