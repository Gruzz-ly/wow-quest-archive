==Description==
You will never know how thankful we are to you, <race>.  Because of you, [[Moozy Waterwise|Moozy]] and [[Rordan Waterwise|my husband]] are safe.  I won't let either of them out of my sight!

*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
Thank you for your kindness. Truly.

==Completion==
Your kindness will not be forgotten. You are a friend to my family, <name>.

==Notes==
Ethel Waterwise is found at {{coords|53.6|20.6|Thunder Totem}}, sitting alone inside a small building.

:What's that? Speak into my good ear.

:''{{gossip|Your family is at the Hammer's Cradle.}}''

:{{text|say|Ah, these old bones haven't moved in a while.}}

This is a ''very'' slow escort quest. Make sure to stay close in front of Ethel; if you go behind her or run too far ahead, she will stop and scold you with lines such as {{text|say|Get where I can see you!}} or {{text|say|Slow down, <bull calf/heifer>!}}

Halfway across the bridge to the main structure of Thunder Totem, a [[Fleshrender Roc]] will swoop down on Ethel, but she simply chases it off.
:{{text|yell|Get outta here, varmint!}}

Upon arriving inside the Hammer's Cradle, the following exchange occurs.

:''Ethel walks up to Moozy Waterwise, who is lying in a basket hanging from his mother Sella's back.''
:{{text|say|Ethel Waterwise|There's my Moozy...}}
:''Ethel snatches the basket from Sella, puts it on her own back and starts dancing.''
:{{text|yell|Sella Waterwise|Mother!}}
:''However, Sella then starts laughing. Before long, Ethel hands Moozy back to his mother.''
