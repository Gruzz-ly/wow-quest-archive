* [[Scrapmetal Palmplate]]
* [[Scrapmetal Handguard]]
* [[Scrapmetal Cuffplate]]
* [[Scrapmetal Fingerplates]]

==Description==
I sense great strength in you, yet you refuse to wield it. We [[Ironhorn tribe|Ironhorn]] use double the metal of any normal blacksmith to craft our wares.

There is also a technique in how you hammer such quantities of leystone that I will instruct you on.

Use our scrap metal and hammer out the pieces for a gauntlet. I will weld the pieces together when you are finished.

==Rewards==
You will learn: Ironhorn Leysmithing ([[Leystone Gauntlets]] Rank 2 recipe)

You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|89|}}
* 15,620 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I'm waiting, outsider.

==Completion==
Your hammerwork is solid, outsider. You have separated yourself from the chaff.

==Notes==
On accept, the following item recipes are learned: [[Small Heated Scrap Metal]], [[Medium Heated Scrap Metal]], [[Large Heated Scrap Metal]], [[Scrapmetal Fingerplates]], [[Scrapmetal Palmplate]], [[Scrapmetal Handguard]], and [[Scrapmetal Cuffplate]].

:{{Text|say|Barm Stonebreaker|A responsible smith does not waste material. You may use any pieces of scrap metal that you find around our camp.}}
:{{Text|say|Barm Stonebreaker|To hammer the metal is to hammer yourself. How far are you willing to bend, greenhorn?}}

;During quest
*{{Text|say|Barm Stonebreaker|Do not simply use your arm to swing the hammer. You have your torso, your legs, your spirit.}}
*{{Text|say|Barm Stonebreaker|Do not be a slave to your hammer. It is an extension of your arm. YOU are its master.}}
*{{Text|say|Barm Stonebreaker|To hammer the metal is to hammer yourself. How far are you willing to bend, greenhorn?}}

[[Small Metal Scrap]]s, [[Medium Metal Scrap]]s, and [[Large Metal Scrap]]s appear to be looted. On [[Greenhoof's Forge]] make the scrap metals and then on [[Greenhoof's Anvil]] make the required items.
