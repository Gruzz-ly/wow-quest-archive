==Objectives==
Speak to Navarrogg to travel to the [[Dragon's Spine]] in [[Neltharion's Lair]].
* Speak to [[Navarrogg]]

==Description==
Beneath us lies the former home of the [[Black dragon|dragon]] Neltharion. You may know him as [[Deathwing]].

If your [[titanic watcher|titan watcher]] [[MOTHER|friend]] detected an essence of [[dragon]] [[magic]] coalescing nearby, it may be an echo of the power of the [[dragonflight]]s. Such power will be coveted by others as well.

This force is likely originating from the most potent area within the lair--the decaying bones of my kin slain in the throes of Deathwing's fury.

We must go before the essence falls into the wrong hands.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I hope the trip down was not as...rocky for you as it was for me.

==Notes==

Greetings, <race>. Are you ready to travel into the heart of the mountain?

I have transport prepared when you are ready. I will remain here to watch over the mesa.

{{Gossip|I am ready to go.}}

The player is transported into the Dragon's Spine scenario. There are [[Crazed Gyreworm]]s, [[Crazed Earth Rager]]s, [[Ma'haat the Indomitable]], [[Blacktalon Watcher]], and dead [[Stonedark Protector]]s.
