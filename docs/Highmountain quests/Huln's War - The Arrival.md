;Speaking with Ebonhorn

:{{text|say|Spiritwalker Ebonhorn|Huln was the strongest of champions and first of our tribe.}}

This quest and its follow-ups put you in an instanced version of pre-''[[World of Warcraft: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]'' [[Azshara]], down to using the original zone map. Oddly, it is already ruined and has its post-[[Great Sundering|Sundering]] coastline, despite the flashback supposedly taking place during the [[War of the Ancients]], before the Sundering. The exact geography is the post-''Cataclysm'' version with the goblin structures and ocean removed. The craters from the battle during [[First Come, First Served]] are still present, obviously made by the demons in this context.

The instance is surrounded by invisible walls at all sides &mdash; both at the coast, preventing you from falling off cliffs, and at the road to [[Ashenvale]], which is blocked by a green fog that eventually stops at another invisible wall. Enemy targets include [[Plague Imp]]s, [[Felguard Legionnaire]]s, and [[Infernal Siegebreaker]]s.

The player controls Huln Highmountain as a vehicle with the following abilities:
#Wild Carve
#Harpoon Stomp
#Gore Charge

;Description
Huln Highmountain is the origin of our strength as a tribe. He bested the Legion when last they threatened our survival and unified many disparate tribes.

Listen to his story, and you will know why his name imbues courage into the cowardly and strikes fear into the fearless.

Huln cleared the path for the furbolg and tauren reinforcements before speaking with their leader, Unng Ak.

;Completion
Spiritwalker Ebonhorn: Unng Ak was grateful for the help of the tauren. He was unsure if they would come at the request of Krasus or if they would stay within their mountain until it was too late.
