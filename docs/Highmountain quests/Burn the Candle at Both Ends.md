:{{text|say|Snazzle Shinyfinder|I found shiniest shinies for boss!}}

Talk to Snazzle:
{{Dialogue|Me find shiny coins at bury place! So many, so shiny. What me do with them?

}}

}}

:{{text|say|Intern Jackie|I keep chair warm while boss gone.}}

[[Dug Digger]] can be found nearby, crashed from some cave rubble. After confirming Dug is dead, one goes to check on [[Kindle Candlecrafter]] next:
{{Dialogue|Candle almost ready! Just needs magic touch and Candleking will have best candle I ever make!

}}
