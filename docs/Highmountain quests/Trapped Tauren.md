==Objectives==
Free the captured [[Rivermane tribe|Rivermane]] tauren.
* [[Captive Rivermane|Tauren]] released

==Description==
The [[drogbar]] just rounded up those of us that they could and led them to a cave near here.

If you act quickly, I think they can still be saved. I know not what purpose they have for capturing our people.

I shudder to think of it... in the deep places, the darkness rules.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}} (at level 100)
*15,050 [[XP]] (at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
They slew many of my brothers and sisters, but at least some managed to escape. Others, however, we captured.

==Completion==
They have returned relatively unharmed. Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
Click on the [[Wooden Barricade]] to free the prisoners.
