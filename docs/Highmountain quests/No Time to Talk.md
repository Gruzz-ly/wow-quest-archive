Destroy 8 Enraged Ambershard. 
* [[Enraged Ambershard]] slain (8)

==Description==
[[Dargrul]] has sent his pets to do battle with us.

We need to crush these [[elemental]]s before their rage swarms into [[Thunder Totem]].

You will receive:
*{{cost|15|40}}
* 14,800 [[XP]] (15,050 at level 100)
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Highmountain Tribe]]

==Progress==
We will all be honorary masons if this keeps up much longer.

==Completion==
It has been a long time since the earth itself has moved against us like this.

==Notes==
You may most likely come across this quest or at least become aware of it while getting [[Mu'sha's Tears]] for [[To See the Past]].  Make sure to also pick up [[Wrathshard (quest)]] before setting out.
