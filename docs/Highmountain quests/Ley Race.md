==Notes==
;Speak with Archmage Nielthende
Hop on a mana saber and ride through the ley line spots, it will absorb any energy still present.

{{gossip|Um, what?}}

:Hop on one of my mana sabers and steer it through the tall nodes of Ley Energy you see around you. Steer it through enough Ley Energy to fully charge it and you'll be done! Remember, the mana saber is great at going fast in a straight line; but it slows down through turns. Try and minimize the amount of steering corrections you need.

:{{gossip|Okay.}}
