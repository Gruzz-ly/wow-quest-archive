==Objectives==
Collect Brilliant Golden Scales.
* [[Brilliant Golden Scales]]

==Description==
Have you heard of people taking small [[Golden Carp|golden carp]] as pets?

Well, if it is kept in a pond free of predators, over time it can grow enormous, only limited by the food present.

Centuries ago, one of these fish lived in the pond atop a mountain. It ate everything and began to starve, so my people dug a river that connected the pond to the ocean so the fish could be free.

Now, fishermen talk of being attacked by an enormous golden fish in the [[Rockaway Shelf]].

Kill it. Take his scales back to [[Atikka "Ace" Moonchaser|Atikka]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you meet with [[Torv Dubstomp|Torv]] yet?

==Completion==
<After hearing your retelling of Torv's plan, Atikka bursts into laughter.>

A centuries old goldfish?!

I told you he was insane!

Ahhh, good work. Glad to see you weren't eaten by a guppy.

==Notes==
Travel from [[Thunder Totem]] to [[Prepfoot]], then continue northeast until you reach Rockaway Shelf. Kill [[Bassline]] to get the scales. {{co|61.3|22.8|Highmountain}}
