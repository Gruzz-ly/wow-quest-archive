==Objectives==
Slay High Crawliac, the Witchqueen.
* [[High Crawliac]] slain

==Description==
The time has come to assault High Crawliac, the Witchqueen.

You should know that one does not become queen of the [[harpy|harpies]] through kindness.

This creature has killed, betrayed, and tormented countless [[tauren]], harpies, [[kobold]]s, and anything else she had to in order to secure her position as queen.

I suspect your [[artifact]] is the only way we are going to stand a chance in this fight.

Come, friend, let us finish this.
