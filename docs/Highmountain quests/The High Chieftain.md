==Objectives==
Speak with [[Mayla Highmountain]] at [[Thunder Totem]]. 

==Description==
I understand what [[Ebonhorn]] has been trying to tell me for a while now.

[[Highmountain tauren|Our people]] do not need a hammer, we need a leader. One willing to stand against any threat, even if they are terrified to do so.

And between you and me, I am definitely terrified, but resolved.

Let us return to Thunder Totem and prepare ourselves for war.
