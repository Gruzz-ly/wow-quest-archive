'''Book of Binding: The Mad Witch''' starts from the [[Book of Binding: The Mad Witch (item)|Whispering Book Binding]] found on the ground in the [[Gromit Hollow]] of the [[Windswept Aerie]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Collect 12 crimson pages, then bring them to [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*[[Book of Binding: The Mad Witch (item)]] (provided)
*[[Crimson Pages]] (12)

==Description==
[[File:Crimson Pages.jpg|thumb|Crimson Pages.]]
<You hear a muffled voice speaking from within this book, interspersed with crackling static. Though the utterances are mostly unintelligible, you can make out the repeated request to recover crimson pages.

Flipping through the volume, you note that many of its pages are missing.

If the pages were retrieved, the book could be returned to the Archivist and reassembled.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*250x [[Cataloged Research]]
*+500 reputation with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Progress==
Is that book... speaking?

==Completion==
Scholars at the [[Seeker's Quorum]] were researching this tome.

It appears as though it was a fellow scholar, not mawsworn or wildlife, that tore it apart. This is troubling. 

For our safety, I will stitch all but one missing page back into the binding before I add this to the archive. Until we know more about this relic, we cannot risk restoring it entirely.

==Notes==
Find pages all throughout the [[Gromit Hollow]] in the [[Windswept Aerie]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Suir|The Archive is in your debt, Maw Walker. This way please.}}

The book, behind [[Assistant Scholar Kah-Vez]], reads:
{{book|Book of Binding: The Mad Witch|content=
<The ancient tome has been painstakingly restored and reassembled, save for a single missing page. Upon opening the book, a voice that was once calm and measured shrieks at you in rage.>

Did you not understand my directions? Where is the final crimson page?!

You must release me from this prison!

And heed my warning... whatever you do, no matter what he tells you, do not touch the azure pages! Do not set him free! He speaks nothing but lies!
}}

This counts as one of the relics for [[Reliquary Restoration]].

;Completion
:The scholars were researching this tome at the [[Seeker's Quorum]].
:How it traveled so far, and how it was torn to pieces is a mystery.
:No matter. What is important is that it has returned. I will stitch the pages back into the binding and add it to the archive. 
:I was not personally involved with studying this particular artifact, but I have heard others claim that the book spoke to them. I'm most curious to learn more about it.
