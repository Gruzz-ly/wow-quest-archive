'''Ve'rayn's Head''' starts by separating [[Ve'rayn's Head (item)]] from [[Ve'rayn|her body]] after completing the [[Pop Quiz]] vignette in [[Korthia]]. The vignette starts at several locations &mdash; see the "Pop Quiz" article for more information.

==Completion==
Is that what I think it is...?

On complete:
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|You have done me a great favor. Ve'rayn had proven herself... problematic for some time.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|[[Cartel Ve]] will continue to send operatives after me, but eliminating Ve'rayn affords me significant time.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|In exchange, I will inform you if I discover any commentary on your dialogues with Ve'rayn among her records.}}
:{{text|say|Ve'nari|Although I am certain there's nothing to be concerned about there...}}
