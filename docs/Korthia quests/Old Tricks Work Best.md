==Objectives==
[[File:Moros.jpg|thumb|[[Moros]]]]

Kill Moros, Oizys, and Apate, commanders of the [[mawsworn]].
*[[Moros]] slain {{co|40.8|41.0|Korthia}}
*[[Oizys]] slain {{co|60.1|53.7|Korthia}}
*[[Apate]] slain {{co|44.1|42.4|Korthia}}

==Description==
[[File:Oizys.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Oizys]]]]

<Name>. Here we are again, fighting alongside each other to protect the [[Shadowlands]].

We're waging a losing war, but we might be able to turn the tide. I need you to seek out some very specific commanders of the mawsworn forces. In every army, there's good commanders and bad ones. By taking out the good ones, only the bad ones advance, weakening the force as a whole.

Our Eyes have brought us the names, now I just need you to kill them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Have we weakened their command yet?

==Completion==

A power vacuum can cause more damage to an army than any bomb or battle.

==Notes==
[[Moros]] and [[Apate]] are just northwest of [[Seeker's Quorum]], while [[Oizys]] is on the [[Path of Understanding]].

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
