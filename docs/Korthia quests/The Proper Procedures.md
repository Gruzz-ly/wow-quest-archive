'''The Proper Procedures''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Collect 5 Lost Anima Vessels.
*[[Anima Vessel]] collected (5)

==Description==
I came here to observe the actions of those from [[Revendreth]]. However I have been met with news that concerns me.

<Name>, the [[attendant]]s tell me that they stored [[anima]] in canisters and that anima is being looted, by our own people. That's not how this should be done.

Can I entrust you to retrieve the anima, so I might see it returned to it's proper place?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +125 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
It's shameful. We have rules and procedures for a reason.

==Completion==
There's so much anima here. This will be very useful in helping the attendants rebuild. Thank you.

==Notes==
Find vessels in the [[Seeker's Quorum]].

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
