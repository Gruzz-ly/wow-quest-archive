'''War Prototype''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
[[File:Kraxis.jpg|thumb|[[Kraxis]]]]
Use the Atleos prototype in the Windswept Aerie to defeat Kraxis.
*[[Atleos]] activated in [[Windswept Aerie]] {{co|28.8|52.6|Korthia}}
*[[Kraxis]] defeated {{co|25|55|Korthia}}

==Description==
As [[Mikanikos|Forgelite Prime]], I always work to make something better!

But largest [[centurion]]s, they are much too large to bring to [[Korthia]]. This, I fix. Here is Atleos, field colossus prototype. Vanguard of the [[Kyrian]]!

It needs testing. More testing. Must be perfect against a powerful opponent.

Go, take Atleos and defeat a great Maw beast! Press all the buttons!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
You have work still, yes?

==Completion==
Ha! Perfect victory. Atleos returns, and you do too.

==Notes==
Look for Atleos standing near the western edge of the ridge in [[Windswept Aerie]], then interact with it to hop in the vehicle. Players have access to five abilities:
#{{abilities|Punch|Punch with righteousness, dealing 7,376 Physical damage.|range=10|cd=1 sec|notes=Instant|id=|image=}}
#{{abilities|Stomp|Slam Atleos' foot down, inflicting 19,668 Physical damage within 8 yards of impact, and increasing damage taken by %s2% for 8 sec.|range=10|cd=6 sec|notes=1.5 sec cast|id=|image=}}
#{{abilities|Purification Cannon|Atleos fires a cannon, inflicting 24,585 Arcane damage on impact, and 4,917 Arcane damage every 1.5 sec for 12 sec.|range=30|cd=12 sec|notes=2.5 sec cast|id=|image=}}
#{{abilities|Shield|Atleos summons a shield which absorbs 11,013 damage for 10 sec.|cd=12 sec|notes=1.5 sec cast}}
#{{abilities|Auto-Repair|Heals Atleos 40% of maximum health over 10 sec.|cd=20 sec|notes=Instant}}

[[Kraxis]] patrols in a loop just uphill. Use abilities on cooldown to defeat the [[charred behemoth]]. Note that it hits for 10,000 health a swing on cloth, so stay in the colossus!
