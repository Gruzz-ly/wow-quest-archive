[[File:Korthian Memory.jpg|thumb|A Korthian memory]]
'''Random Memory Access''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Collect Korthian Memories using the Emphemeral Wings.
*[[Korthian Memories]] recovered (10)
*[[Ephemeral Wings]] (provided)

==Description==
When [[the Jailer]] snared [[Korthia]] and dragged it toward the [[Maw]], he destroyed so much in this place. Not only mountains and buildings, but the people, too.

Those people had lives, hopes, memories.

I have to think that they can't all be gone, and we might be able to save something of them that lingers.

Here, take some of my power. See if you can collect those memories. Bring them to me, and I'll keep them safe. 

No one should be forgotten.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Have you found the Korthians' memories?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I'll make sure these memories are taken care of. 

I wonder what it would have been like, being here as one of them...

==Notes==
Floating just outside of jump range off cliffs in [[Hope's Ascent]] are uninteractable Korthian Memory doodads. Jump, then use the provided [[Ephemeral Wings]] while in the air and glide through the orb to collect it. The wings just provide slow fall, not directional flight (like a [[Goblin Glider Kit]]), so make sure to not aim over the edge of the zone! However, while in the air, players have access to an extra ability that allows them to target the ground near them and jump to it.

On complete, one of:

:{{text|say|Pelagos|I'm afraid they didn't survive the journey into the Maw...}}
*{{text|say|Pelagos|I can see the memory... this one liked to walk along the paths after recording the day's data, looking at the trees. They wondered if their work would prove useful one day.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|It was worth it, I promise. I'll remember you.}}
*{{text|say|Pelagos|I can see the memory... this one found a special secret about one of the other realms of the Shadowlands. They were so excited to record it!}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|I can't see what that secret actually was, though. Sorry.}}
*{{text|say|Pelagos|I can see the memory... this one got very frustrated sometimes because they wanted to know more about the Purpose, and their part in it.}}
:{{text|say|Pelagos|We can't always see our role in the big picture, my friend. Your memory is safe with me.}}
