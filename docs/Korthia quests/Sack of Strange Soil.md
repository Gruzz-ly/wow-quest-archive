[[File:Sack of Strange Soil.jpg|thumb|[[Sack of Strange Soil (item)|Sack of Strange Soil]]]]
Bring the Sack of Strange Soil to [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*[[Sack of Strange Soil (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Your familiarity with [[The Archivists' Codex (item)|the Archivists' Codex]] makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.

Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this soil in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*250x [[Cataloged Research]]
*+500 reputation with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Completion==
This soil can grow any type of plant, anywhere.

Not the most dangerous relic missing from the archive, and yet it could be the most useful. With enough time, one could restore the verdant beauty of Korthia.

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Suir|Another for the collection. Whatever would I do without your aid?}}

''Or''
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Suir|The Archive is in your debt, Maw Walker.}}

The soil reads:
{{book|Sack of Strange Soil|content=
<The dirt within the satchel is a deep brown in color, almost black. A rich aroma arises from it, smelling of earth and spring.

Roh-Suir has mentioned that any seed planted within this soil will grow and thrive regardless of the climate in which it finds itself. In time, perhaps it could even regrow Korthia's own verdant greenery.>
