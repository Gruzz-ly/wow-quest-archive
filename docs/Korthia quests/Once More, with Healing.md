==Objectives==
Restore 10 Wounded Covenant Allies.
*Covenant wounded restored (10)
*[[Mikanikos' Restorative Contraption]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[mawsworn]] continue to engage our forces at [[Vault of Secrets|the Vault]]. There are heavy casualties on both sides. We must help!

Take this and restore any wounded covenant allies you find. [[Mikanikos]] helped me create it. It runs on [[anima]] and should help patch up anyone. Even the [[Stoneborn]] or [[Maldraxxi]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]
*+25 reputation with [[Ascended (faction)|The Ascended]]

==Progress==
I wish we could do more. But we're stretched so thin.

==Completion==
How wonderful! I am relieved to know our allies are no longer wounded.

==Notes==
The wounded are at the [[Vault of Secrets]]. To get there, take the [[Flayedwing Transporter]] at {{co|60.8|28.5|Korthia}} at the Necrolord camp at [[Keeper's Respite]].

Use the provided [[Mikanikos' Restorative Contraption]] on near-dead allies.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}

==Trivia==
*This quest was called "Patching Up the Troops" during development.
