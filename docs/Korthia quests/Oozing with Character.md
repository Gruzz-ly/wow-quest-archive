[[File:Oozing with Character.jpg|thumb|Marileth and Plaguey, Ooz, and Bloop]]
Marileth offers one of three versions of '''Oozing with Character''' when he's present at [[Keeper's Respite]], all involving taking an ooze to the [[Mauler's Outlook]] and performing a similar task.

==Objectives==
;Bloop
:Help [[Bloop (slime)|Bloop]] test their propagation ability in the [[Mauler's Outlook]].
*Bloop propagated (10)
;Ooz
:Help [[Ooz]] test their growth ability in the Mauler's Outlook.
*Ooz grown (5)
;Plaguey
:Help [[Plaguey]] test their infection ability in the Mauler's Outlook.
*[[Shardhide|Shardclaw]] infected (10)

==Description==
Apprentice! I've been looking for you.

[[Kevin]] has been such a wonderful helper in our experiments, I'd like to train my other oozes to be able to assist as well!

;Bloop
:For Bloop, I'd like to know if their ooze is capable of propagation. Take them with you, and find [[shardhide|those bears]]. Give them the command to inject the life form with their ooze and see what happens.
;Ooz
:For Ooz, I'd like to know if they are able to consume organic material and increase in size.
;Plaguey
:Can you take Plaguey with you and test their ability to infect organic life forms?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+125 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
They're good oozes, <name>.

==Completion==
;Bloop
:How did the tests go? OH! Look at all of them! They're so cute!
;Ooz
:How did the tests go? OH! Ooz! You're huge! You're even more beautiful than normal!
;Plaguey
:How did Plaguey do? Is he as viral as we'd hoped?

==Notes==
While in the [[Mauler's Outlook]], the active ooze will be following the player around. Control the ooze by using the extra action button.

Either get the targeted [[shardhide]] to below 30% health before using the bonus ability on it, or kill it, target the corpse, and then use the ability.

;Bloop
:{{Abilities|Command Bloop|Command Bloop to split into two.|range=40|cd=10 sec|notes=Instant|id=354773|icon=inv_maldraxxusslime_green}}
:Target ''live'' [[shardhide]]s, not dead ones, then use the extra ability to debuff them. Once the bear dies, 1-3 Blooplets may pop out.
;Ooz
:{{Abilities|Command Ooz|Command Ooz to consume the corpse.|range=40|cd=10 sec|notes=Instant|id=354876|icon=inv_maldraxxusslime_green}}
:Kill non-cub shardhides, then target the corpses and use the bonus ability
;Plaguey
:{{Abilities|Command Plaguey|Command Plaguey to infect your current weakened target.|range=40|cd=10|notes=Instant.|id=353186|icon=inv_maldraxxusslime_purple}}
:Get the shardhide below 30% health before using the ability, then finish it off.

Each of these quests has an achievement attached for completing the quest ten times:
*[[Friend of Bloop]]
*[[Friend of Ooz]]
*[[Friend of Plaguey]]
