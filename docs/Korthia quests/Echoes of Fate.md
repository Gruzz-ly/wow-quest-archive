==Objectives==
Resonate the [[Fatescribe's Implement]] at the shrines in the [[Sanctuary of Guidance]].
*Anima shrine investigated {{co|56.5|20.3|Korthia}}
*Meditation shrine investigated {{co|53.8|21.4|Korthia}}
*Offering shrine investigated {{co|53.4|14.8|Korthia}}
*[[Fatescribe's Implement]] (provided)

==Description==
[[File:Unburned Incense.jpg|thumb|Unburned Incense]]
The [[devourer]]s have swarmed this place, but our focus must remain on finding the [[Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|Fatescribe]].

[[Attendant]]s who worshipped here would leave offerings of [[anima]] at the shrines.

The implement you found will resonate if the Fatescribe has been nearby. With any luck, it will give us insight into where he has gone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[File:Small Offering.jpg|thumb|Small Offering]]
Using an illusion to hide.

Can you imagine anything so clever?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|Mawsworn. Devourers. This place has seen its share of defilement.}}

In the area, look for [[Protector Rih-Mat]], near death. He starts [[Revenge Delayed]].

On the west end of the sanctuary, be on the lookout for the rare [[Dominated Protector]].

On the east side of the sanctuary is the Unbroken Anima Container:
:{{text|say|Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|He has found us! Korthia is in grave peril!}}
:{{text|say|Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|Arbiter forgive me... but I have need of this anima.}}
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|Why does he need the anima? Such a tedious plan!}}

In the middle is some Unburned Incense:
:{{text|say|Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|Eternal Ones, grant me your guidance and wisdom.}}
:{{text|say|Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|An illusion... yes, that might work. Hide in plain sight. Employ their own tactics against them.}}
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|An illusion? How quaint.}}

To the northwest is a Small Offering:
:{{text|say|Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|I need a scroll from the vault, and the anima to fuel its magic...}}
:{{text|say|Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|May the Purpose shield me. And may they never find me.}}
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|This way! Hurry!}}
:''Kah-Than walks southeast to a small cave.''
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|The Fatescribe! We have him!}}

==Progression==
{{They Could Be Anyone}}
