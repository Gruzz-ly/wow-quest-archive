[[Archivist Roh-Suir]] begins '''Lost Vaults''' at Tier 3 with the [[Archivists' Codex]], unlocking four more relics to find in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Examine the missing relics within the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*Missing relics examined (4)
*[[Teleporter Repair Kit]] purchased from [[Archivist Roh-Suir|Roh-Suir]] (Optional)

==Description==
I've finished research on more relics that may still exist in Korthia. I believe they are still within our smaller vaults.

With your help, I can recreate devices that are capable of repairing entrances to these vaults.

I've placed replicas of the relics that are still missing. Please review them so you know what to look for.

==Progress==
Have you seen the missing relics?

==Completion==
Thank you for your continued aid. The reliquary will be restored, thanks to your diligent work.

==Notes==
Before looking for the ghost items, purchase a [[Teleporter Repair Kit]] for 50 [[Cataloged Research]] from Roh-Suir:
:Well met, Maw Walker. Is there something I can assist you with?
{{buy|I would like to spend some of our Cataloged Research on something.}}

The ghosts of four more objects light up in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]]:
*Drum of the Death Loa {{co|62.4|22.0|Korthia}}
*Everliving Statuette {{co|63.2|21.2|Korthia}}
*Sack of Strange Soil {{co|63.3|22.6|Korthia}}
*Obelisk of Dark Tidings {{co|62.9|23.3|Korthia}}

All objects share the same gossip line
:This relic has yet to be recovered.
