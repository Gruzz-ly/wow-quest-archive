'''Down to Earth''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Use Korayn's Javelin to spear 4 Mawsworn Harbingers.
*[[Mawsworn Harbinger]] speared and slain (4)
*[[Korayn's Javelin]] (provided)

==Description==
I can hear the wings of the [[Mawsworn]] in the sky up above, taunting us. 

But a bird in the hand can be crushed. 

Take my spear and prove your aim. Pull a few down and smite them. 

Be sure to use the spear. Do not traipse among them so that they will chase you back down to the ground. That's not the point.

I want to see you drag them out of the sky.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
There are many problems that can be solved with a well-timed strike.

==Completion==
It is so satisfying to see those flying mawsworn get their wings clipped.

Well done, my friend.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Hunt-Captain Korayn|Remember, hit them with the spear first to drag them out of the sky. This is how we hunt.}}

The [[Mawsworn Harbinger]]s are flying above [[Seeker's Quorum]] and the unnamed central crossroads of [[Korthia]]. Make sure to actually use the provided [[Korayn's Javelin]] to pull the harbingers, or they won't count.

==Patch changes==
