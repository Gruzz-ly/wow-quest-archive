Greetings, mortal!

I am on a mission to deliver messages to our allies here in exciting [[Korthia]]. However, I was unable to complete my task.

Would you collect the messages and return them to me? I will then see them delivered to their intended recipients.

Thank you!

These are the messages that were stolen! I commend you on recovering them.
