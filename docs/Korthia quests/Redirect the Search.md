==Objectives==
Meet [[Caretaker Kah-Than]] at the entrance to the [[Sanctuary of Guidance]] in [[Korthia]].

==Description==
I believe the [[Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|Fatescribe]] was headed to the Sanctuary of Guidance. A holy place for the [[attendant]]s of Korthia.

Fortunately, because you seem to be in the habit of picking up every piece of trash you find, we have the [[Fatescribe's Implement]]!

I'm sure that will prove useful in locating him. But first, on to the Sanctuary.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Name>! At last! 

You know very well that I can't do this without you!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|Let us rendezvous near the Sanctuary of Guidance, <name>. Make haste!}}

Back to the north end of the zone, just west of [[Keeper's Respite]]. Approach Kah-Than:
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|Good news, <name>! I found more monstrosities for you to vanquish!}}

==Progression==
{{They Could Be Anyone}}
