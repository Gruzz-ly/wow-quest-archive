'''Unstable Explosive Orb''' starts from the [[Unstable Explosive Orb (item)]] at {{co|29.0|54.2|Korthia}} inside [[Rift (Shadowlands)|The Rift]] in [[Korthia]]. Gain access to the Rift by using a [[Repaired Riftkey]] at any nearby [[Rift Portal]], then navigate to where the [[Dominated Protector]] spawns in the [[Sanctuary of Guidance]] to find the explosive, which starts this quest.

==Objectives==
[[File:Unstable Sin'dorei Explosive - in rift.jpg|thumb|[[Unstable Explosive Orb (item)]]]]
Bring the Unstable Explosive Orb to [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*[[Unstable Explosive Orb (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Your familiarity with [[The Archivists' Codex (item)|the Archivists' Codex]] makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.

Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this device in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*500x [[Cataloged Research]]
*+500 reputation with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Completion==
I appreciate you handling this relic carefully. It is nothing short of a miracle that it did not detonate when Korthia was invaded.

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Suir|Another for the collection. Whatever would I do without your aid?}}

The explosive reads:
{{book|Unstable Explosive Orb|content=
<A massive amount of explosive energy hums within the orb. You cannot discern any physical mechanism that keeps the magic within contained.

This relic has existed within the archive for untold eons. If it were truly unstable and liable to explode at any moment, the archivists would certainly have taken measures to ensure its safe storage.

You simply hope such measures are still in place.>
