'''Celestial Shadowlands Chart''' starts from the [[Celestial Shadowlands Chart (item)|Celestial Shadowlands Chart]] object on the ground in [[Seeker's Quorum]].

==Objectives==
Collect 6 afterlife navigation research scrolls, then bring them to [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*[[Afterlife Navigation Research]] (6)
*[[Celestial Shadowlands Chart (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
[[File:Celestial Shadowlands Map active.jpg|thumb|Celestial Shadowlands Chart - activated.]]
<You recognize this relic from the Archivists' Codex.

The mawsworn discarded it, believing it to be useless.

And the chart is useless, without the accompanying data to plot the relative locations of Shadowlands afterlives. If the research were retrieved from deceased scholars, the chart could be returned to the Archivist, fully functional.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*250x [[Cataloged Research]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Progress==
Is that the missing chart?

==Completion==
Aha! You have recovered the Celestial Shadowlands Chart.

With the chart and the data you collected, it can be restored to its fully functional form. It will take some time to analyze and interpret the results, which I can get started on now that the relic has been returned to the Archive.

Allow me a moment to find a good spot for it...

==Notes==
[[File:Vault Attendant.jpg|thumb|[[Vault Attendant]].]]
Find [[Afterlife Navigation Research]] scrolls on the corpses of [[Korthian Attendant]]s in the [[Seeker's Quorum]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Suir|Another for the collection. Whatever would I do without your aid?}}

The chart on the table behind Roh-Suir now reads:
{{book|Celestial Shadowlands Chart|content=
<No matter how long you examine the chart, you cannot make sense of it. The enchanted projection of the In-Between swirls in constant motion, and the myriad afterlives found within it are all but impossible to distinguish from one another.

It appears that the geography of the Shadowlands is beyond mortal understanding.>
}}

This counts as one of the relics for [[Reliquary Restoration]].
