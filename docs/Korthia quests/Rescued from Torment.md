==Objectives==
Rescue 6 [[Tortured Attendant]]s in [[Seeker's Quorum]].
*Attendants rescued (6)

==Description==
The Mawsworn are not only killing those they find in the Seeker's Quorum. They are interrogating the survivors.

We should help save those we can. It's possible one of them might have seen the [[Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|Fatescribe]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Someone has to have seen something.

==Completion==
I struggle to believe that not a single attendant has any information on where the Fatescribe might be.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Last Place You Look]] before heading out.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|I will meet you in the ruins. Thank you for assisting my search, <name>.}}
:''Kah-Than walks off.''

South to the Seeker's Quorum, where Kah-Than catches up:
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|I would assist you, but combat is not my expertise.}}

Look for [[Tortured Attendant]]s, held captive by [[Mawsworn Interrogator]]s. The first interrogator killed will drop a [[Korthian Artifact]], which starts [[Looting the Looters]].

Free attendants:
*{{text|say|Tortured Attendant|I must... find safety...}}
*{{text|say|Tortured Attendant|I told them... I knew nothing...}}
*{{text|say|Tortured Attendant|Such... horror...}}
*{{text|say|Tortured Attendant|So much... pain...}}
*{{text|say|Tortured Attendant|They... seek the Fatescribe... couldn't tell them anything.}}
*{{text|say|Tortured Attendant|What... do they want with him?}}

==Progression==
{{They Could Be Anyone}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
