'''Anima Reclamation''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Reclaim 8 Devoured Anima from [[devourer]]s at the [[Sanctuary of Guidance]].
*[[Devoured Anima (Korthia)]] (8)

==Description==
Our efforts here need a constant supply of troops, supplies, and [[anima]]. The last one is the hardest, for obvious reasons. But I've learned to be resourceful. 

Nearby there is a plentiful source of anima: the devourers that currently swarm the Sanctuary of Guidance. It's not as easy as beating it out of a soul, but it's just as effective, if you're strong enough. Are you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75/125 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Every drop of anima we reclaim is a potential weapon against [[the Jailer]].

==Completion==
You can trust me with this anima. I will see it is turned against the Jailer and his forces.

==Notes==
The Sanctuary is just across the road to the west. Any and all of the devourers in the area work, including the new [[Nimble Scavenger]] and [[Mindseize Controller]] types.
