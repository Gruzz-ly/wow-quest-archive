'''Mawsworn Rituals''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Collect 8 Mawsworn Grimoires.
*[[Mawsworn Grimoire]] (8)

==Description==
The [[Mawsworn]] have a myriad of magic users among their forces. Their magic is unknown to us and that makes it deadly.

We need to learn what they are capable of to properly prepare a defense. My own curiosity about their methods and rituals is secondary.

Hunt down these vile casters and bring me their grimoires.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +125 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Knowing your enemy is a powerful weapon.

==Completion==
The information contained in these is dangerous and vile. But knowing what our enemy can do helps us protect against it.

==Notes==
Find the grimoires on the corpses of [[Mawsworn Interrogator]]s at [[Seeker's Quorum]].

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
