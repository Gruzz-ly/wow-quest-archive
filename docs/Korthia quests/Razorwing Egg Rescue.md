'''Razorwing Egg Rescue''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Collect 5 Razorwing Eggs.
*[[Abandoned Razorwing Egg]] collected (5)

==Description==
I'm amazed by the wildlife here in [[Korthia]]! So many interesting creatures...

Say, you know those flying beasts with the claws, the [[Razorwing]]? They sometimes knock their eggs out of their nests, and then they completely ignore them! If you find any abandoned eggs, could you bring them to me?

Gently, of course. I wonder if they can be raised to be friendly?

If not, well, it wouldn't be the first time I've had my antennae chewed on.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Have you found any Razorwing eggs?

==Completion==
Look at these wonderful eggs! I can hear their heartbeats.

This is the start of something beautiful, I just know it.

==Notes==
