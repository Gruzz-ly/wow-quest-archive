Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
A nefarious Maw magus named Nocturnus the Unraveler is hampering the efforts of [[Cartel Xy|the Cartel]] in Korthia.

Anyone who exterminates this evil will be rewarded. 

Use caution, Nocturnus is a powerful foe and you may require several allies to defeat him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +125 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
What news do you bring of Nocturnus the Unraveler?

==Completion==
Thanks to you, Nocturnus the Unraveler will no longer hinder Cartel Xy here in Korthia. 

And you have my personal thanks as well, Maw Walker. I see many great things in our future.

Please accept this reward as a token of our gratitude.

==Notes==
The quest-marked location on the map is unclear. Head south to the [[Scholar's Den]] and enter the [[Caverns of Contemplation]] at {{co|60|32|Korthia}}. Notcurnus is at the back of the cave in the lower level. Though the quest suggests a party of three, well-geared players can solo the maw necromancer.

==PTR version==
;Description
:There is great power in the dark art of necromancy. The Jailer knows this all too well, his Mawsworn army employs several necromancers.
:Among the Jailer's necromantic forces in Korthia, Nocturnus the Unraveler is regarded as the most cruel and dangerous.
:Nocturnus must be defeated, but I must caution you not to go alone. You will surely need allies at your side to defeat him.
:Return to me when Nocturnus the Unraveler is no more and I will prepare a fitting reward for your efforts.
