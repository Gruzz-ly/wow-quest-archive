'''Book of Binding: The Tormented Sorcerer''' starts from the [[Book of Binding: The Tormented Sorcerer (item)|Blue Book]] at {{co|60.8|34.9|Korthia}} inside [[Rift (Shadowlands)|The Rift]] in [[Korthia]]. Gain access to the Rift by using a [[Repaired Riftkey]] at any nearby [[Rift Portal]], then head to the [[Scholar's Den]]. Unlike the other Rift-bound objects, the book is not visible in the normal phase of existence.

==Objectives==
[[File:Azure Pages.jpg|thumb|[[Azure Pages]]]]
Collect 10 azure pages, then bring them to Archivist Roh-Suir in the Reliquary of Remembrance.
*[[Book of Binding: The Tormented Sorcerer (item)]] (provided)
*[[Azure Pages]] (10)

==Description==
<You hear a muffled voice speaking from within this book, interspersed with crackling static. Though the utterances are mostly unintelligible, you can make out the repeated request to recover azure pages.

Flipping through the volume, you note that many of its pages are missing.

If the pages were retrieved, the book could be returned to the Archivist and reassembled.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*500x [[Cataloged Research]]
*+500 reputation with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Progress==
I find these speaking tomes discomfiting.

==Completion==
This appears to be a companion tome to [[Book of Binding: The Mad Witch (item)|the crimson book]] that was under the care of scholars in the [[Seeker's Quorum]].

Knowing that this book binding was separated from its pages intentionally, I will stitch all but one azure page back into it before returning it to the archive.

==Notes==
[[File:Book of Binding - The Tormented Sorceror.jpg|thumb|Book of Binding - The Tormented Sorcerer]]
Exit [[Rift (Shadowlands)|The Rift]] and enter the Caverns of Contemplation to find Azure Pages.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Suir|Another for the collection. Whatever would I do without your aid?}}

The book reads:
{{book|Book of Binding: The Tormented Sorcerer|content=
<When you first found this book, the muffled voice within was relatively calm. Now that it has been reassembled, save for a single page, the voice is yelling at you.

The tome rustles with every word.>

Are you here to release me? You must!

Recover just one additional azure page...

Remember, do not touch the crimson pages. Do not open the other book. She seeks to persuade you with her lies! You have been warned!
