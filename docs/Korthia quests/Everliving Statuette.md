<It is difficult to determine the statuette's age, but something about it feels older than you can imagine. There is no telling what events it must have witnessed over the eons.

Roh-Suir has warned you not to trust any of its whispers. Whatever wisdom it seeks to share is surely wrapped in deceit.>
