'''Legend of the Animaswell''' is a weekly quest started from the [[Legend of the Animaswell (item)]], which drops from [[Fleshwing]] in [[Korthia]].

This will unlock a [[Legend of the Animaswell (adventure)|new adventure]] on the Command Table.

==Objectives==
Deliver [[Legend of the Animaswell (item)]] to [[Merick Feldscar]] in the [[Seat of the Primus]].

==Description==
<This appears to be an incomplete set of notes detailing one archivist's search for a mythical font of anima hidden somewhere deep in [[Korthia]].

[[Merick Feldscar]] in the [[Seat of the Primus]] would be able to help you put together a team to search for it.>

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
*{{Abilities|Legend of the Animaswell|id=357528|icon=icon_treasuremap}}

==Completion==
<Merick Feldscar carefully studies the documents you brought him.>

The documentation is incomplete. It is unclear if the archivist even survived...

But the tales of the anima are impressive, and there are enough details here to launch an expedition.

It will not be easy. The archivist warns of many dangers protecting the anima source...

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Merick Feldscar|Use the Command Table when you're ready to hunt for the Animaswell. I'll take care of everything else.}}

This unlocks the Legend of the Animaswell adventure on the Command Table, which rewards an [[Animaswell Prism]], worth 250 [[Reservoir Anima]].
