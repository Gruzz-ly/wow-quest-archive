==Objectives==
Infuse the Lodestaff with [[anima]].
*Charge the Lodestaff (0/100%)
*[[Lodestaff]] (provided)

==Description==
Normally we would infuse the Lodestaff with energy from [[:the Netherstar]], another relic of note.

Regrettably, that is not an option. But, in a pinch, anima is an acceptable substitute.

Take the Lodestaff. Brandish it near recently slain [[devourer]]s in [[Estuary of Awakening|the estuary below us]].

The staff should draw in and absorb their anima.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did it work? Did the Lodestaff absorb their anima?

==Completion==
The Lodestaff is humming with vibrant energy! The anima worked better than I could have hoped.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Consulting the Experts]] before heading out.

Roh-Senara has gossip:
:We are safer here, but it is only a matter of time before the Mawsworn find us.

As does Roh-Suir after picking up Consulting the Efforts:
:What secrets will we learn from the Archivists of old?

Valid devourers include [[Hungering Mite]]s (6%), [[Ravenous Scavenger (Korthia)|Ravenous Scavengers]] (9%), [[Ravenous Gorger]]s (12%) and [[Colossal Worldeater]]s (16%). Kill them, then make sure to ''use the quest item on their corpses''.

Kill the first devourer:
:{{text|say|Scholar Roh-Suir|Even devourers serve the Purpose. We will reclaim the anima they feed upon to empower the Lodestaff.}}
