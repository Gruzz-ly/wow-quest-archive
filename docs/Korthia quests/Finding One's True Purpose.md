==Objectives==
Participate in the ritual to attune the [[:Lodestaff]].
*Begin the Ritual {{co|35.9|32.2|Korthia}}
*Complete the Ritual

==Description==
[[File:Lodestaff.jpg|thumb|The Lodestaff.]]
All our efforts have led us here.

With the combined wisdom of the Archivists, and a little help from a <race> <class>, we will attune the Lodestaff to the relics that we seek.

Should we succeed, we will have what we need to re-establish the Archive.

Our sacred work can then continue.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is it over? Was the attuning a success?

==Completion==
So much has been taken from us. And yet, due to Roh-Senara's sacrifice, there is hope.

==Notes==
[[File:Finding One's True Purpose - marked spot.jpg|thumb|The marked spot at Roh-Senara's side.]]
On accept:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Senara|Take your place at my side, mortal.}}

Step into the marked location beside Roh-Senara and use the bonus ability:
:{{Abilities|Attune the Lodestaff|Participate in the ritual to attune the Lodestaff|icon=inv_staff_94|range=10|notes=Instant.}}

This begins a long channel. In the meantime:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Senara|Fueled by anima and guided by wisdom, the Lodestaff will lead its wielder to every relic the archive has ever held. Our sacred Purpose shall continue.}}
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Senara|Archivists of old! Give unto the Lodestaff all of your knowledge! Though your echoes will be forever lost, your sacrifice shall never be forgotten!}}
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Senara|Archivist Roh-Gema!}}
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Senara|Archivist Roh-Luda!}}
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Senara|Archivist Roh-Kiel!}}
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Senara|Archivist Roh-Mah!}}
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Senara|And... Archivist Roh-Senara. May my wisdom provide guidance in our darkest hour, so [[Korthia]] might once again witness the dawn.}}
:''Roh-Senara's corporeal body hits the floor.''
:{{text|say|Scholar Roh-Suir|Roh-Senara, no! We need you!}}
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Senara|For the Purpose!}}
