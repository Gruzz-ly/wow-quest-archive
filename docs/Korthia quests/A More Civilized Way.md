'''A More Civilized Way''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Nadjia the Mistblade|Nadjia]] near the road leading into [[Korthia]].
*Meet Nadjia {{co|41.0|32.0|Korthia}}
*Pick up the rapier
*Defeat Nadjia in a duel (0/100%)

==Description==
Ah, <name>.

I have a matter to discuss with you. But not here.

<Nadjia eyes the other denizens of [[Keeper's Respite]] suspiciously.>

Meet me where the road enters Korthia from [[Maw|the Maw]] and I will explain.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
You must always hone your skills. Or one day, you will slip and that will be the end.

==Completion==
Your form still needs work. Thank you, for taking time out of our unending campaign to duel. We must remember, even in times of great struggle, to do things that bring us joy.

==Notes==
Head west to the central crossroads, near the entrance to [[Hope's Ascent]], then cut north. Nadjia's practicing her rapier strikes in a small clearing just east of the road. Stand in the marked red circle, then pick up the rapier in the weapon rack next to her.

Hop back in the red circle, and players enter the vehicle interface and gain access to three abilities:
#{{Abilities|Lunge|Perform a swift lunge.|icon=ability_warrior_charge}}
#{{Abilities|Parry|Parry your opponent's attack.|icon=ability_parry}}
#{{Abilities|Riposte|Use your parry to perform a counter attack.|icon=ability_warrior_riposte}}

Nadjia will shout commands at random. Use the matching ability to gain 5% progress in filling the bar.

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
