==Objectives==
Recover the Codex of Memories for [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*[[Codex of Memories]] {{co|31.7|40.0|Caverns of Contemplation}} / {{co|58.5|26.9|Korthia}}

==Description==
Let us continue our work by retrieving the most important item of any scholarly study--the lost codex.

It will take some time, but as we continue our work the pages of this work will continue to grow and flourish, just as [[Korthia]] has itself for eons.

As for its location, it previously resided deep within the underbelly of Korthia itself inside the [[Caverns of Contemplation|Cavern of Contemplation]] to the south.

We can only hope [[the Jailer]]'s forces have yet to locate it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[The Archivists' Codex (item)]]
*250x [[Cataloged Research]]
*+500 reputation with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Progress==
Have you found the codex? I hope we're not too late.

==Completion==
Yes, yes. This is it. Magnificent, don't you agree?

<The damp codex catches The Archivist by surprise. He gently runs his hand along the binding, muttering an incantation in a soft, enigmatic tone.>

That should help preserve it for now, but the incantation won't last. We must get to work.

==Notes==
Enter the [[Caverns of Contemplation]] beneath the [[Keeper's Respite]] (the mouth of the cave is at {{co|60|32|Korthia}} in the [[Scholar's Den]]), jump downstairs, then head to the western fork of the cave to find the Damaged Binding
