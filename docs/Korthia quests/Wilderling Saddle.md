'''Wildering Saddle''' starts from the [[Wilderling Saddle (item)]], which is rarely rewarded from the [[Escaped Wilderling]] vignette on [[Hope's Ascent]] in western [[Korthia]] for [[Night Fae Covenant]] players only.

==Objectives==
Deliver Wilderling Saddle to [[Reldorn]] in [[Keeper's Respite]].
*[[Wilderling Saddle (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<As you slipped off of the escaped [[wilderling]]'s back, it shook its saddle off at your feet. It reluctantly left your side as the [[night fae]] led it back to [[Keeper's Respite]].

Reldorn in Keeper's Respite might know what to make of this gesture.>

==Rewards==

You will receive:
*[[Summer Wilderling Harness]]

==Completion==
<Reldorn laughs when he sees the saddle you're carrying.>

I had wondered where that one's saddle had ended up. He has resisted every rider that has attempted companionship with it, but it appears he has finally found one he considers worthy.

You have made a very stubborn, loyal companion this day, <name>.

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Reldorn|Take care you do not mistake his stubbornness for foolishness. Trust his instincts, <name>...}}
