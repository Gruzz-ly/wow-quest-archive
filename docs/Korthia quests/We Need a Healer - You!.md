Restore 10 Wounded Covenant Allies in [[Seeker's Quorum]].

There are too many wounded on the battlefield! 

Not everyone can 'bash it and make better.' We need more healers.

You: take my device and get our wounded back on their feet!

That got them back on their feet!

Any little bit helps to keep us in the fight.
