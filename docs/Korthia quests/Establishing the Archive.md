'''Establishing the Archive''' concludes the "Archivists of Korthia" side chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], but the reputation grind continues.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Scholar Roh-Suir]] at [[Keeper's Respite]].

==Description==
I will head to Keeper's Respite, where there is some small semblance of safety.

There, we will establish a new archive.

Meet me there when you are able.

I hope we can count on you again. We will have need of your assistance there in the future.

==Rewards==
You will learn the following:
* {{Abilities|Archivists' Codex|Unlocks the Archivists' Codex reputation with Roh-Suir, allowing him to create Cataloged Research from Korthian Relics.|icon=inv_misc_book_17}}

You will also receive
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is hard to imagine how I will continue without the Archivist.

==Notes==
