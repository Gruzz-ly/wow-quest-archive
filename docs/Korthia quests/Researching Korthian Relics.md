'''Researching Korthian Relics''' begins the Archivists of Korthia side chain, part of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], which eventually unlocks the [[Archivists' Codex]] faction and [[Cataloged Research]] drops. To start the quest, find the [[Researching Korthian Relics (item)]] item by opening containers in [[Korthia]], like the [[Mawsworn Cache]], or killing rare creatures for [[Conquering Korthia]].

A name written within its pages begins to glow: "Roh-Suir."

Perhaps this Roh-Suir could help you discover more about the relics you've found.>
