'''Singing Steel Ingot''' starts from the [[Singing Steel Ingot (item)|Singing Steel Ingot]] on an anvil at the [[Path of Understanding]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Defeat [[mawsworn]] invaders, then bring the Singing Steel Ingot to [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*Mawsworn slain
*Mawsworn slain (3)
*Mawsworn slain (20)
*[[Singing Steel Ingot (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<The ingot wails, in a warbling vibrato.>

Woe! These ruffians hammer upon me with nary a care, bending my body to suit their ill aims.

Fie! Fie upon them.

<The ingot emits a high-pitched battle cry.>

Take the hammering to these mawsworn!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 250x [[Cataloged Research]]
* +500 reputation with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Progress==
Is that ingot... singing?

==Completion==
In all of my years as a researcher, I never would have expected this.

==Notes==
Find the Singing Steel Ingot on an anvil being worked on by a [[Mawsworn Steelshaper]] at the [[Path of Understanding]] at the southeastern tip of the Korthia mainland.

Pick up the quest, then slay any single Mawsworn in the area:
:{{text|whisper|Singing Steel Ingot|A single Mawsworn slain, a taste of vengeance once again!}}

The quest objective changes to 1/3. Well then. Slay two more:
:{{text|whisper|Singing Steel Ingot|Though forge and anvil my wrath is borne, so all my foes will know my scorn!}}

A score is twenty, and the quest just gave credit for one. Any mawsworn anywhere in Korthia counts for this quest, so don't feel the need to carpet the [[Path of Understanding]] with mawsworn corpses. Get to twenty:
:{{text|whisper|Singing Steel Ingot|Such carnage wrought brings sheer delight. Slaughter all within your sight!}}

On complete, Roh-Suir will say one of the following:
*{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Suir|Ah, yes. One step closer to a fully restored Archive!}}
*{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Suir|The Archive is in your debt, Maw Walker.}}

The ingot, once placed, has this to say:
{{book|Singing Steel Ingot|content=
<A haunting choral melody emanates from the ingot as you approach it. One might describe it as almost hypnotic, were it not for the occasional harsh and discordant notes punctuating the music at seemingly random intervals.

At least the ingot's song is without lyrics... for now.>
}}

This counts as one of the relics for [[Reliquary Restoration]].

==Progression==
{{Archivists of Korthia}}
