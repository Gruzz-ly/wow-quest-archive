;Description
:The abduction of Korthia into the [[Maw]] has not only been destructive for us, but for the native wildlife as well.
:The [[shardhide|shardclaw]] were once peaceful creatures, but the chaos that has been unleashed upon Korthia has not been kind to them. Many have died, and those that remain are much more aggressive than before.
:One in particular has become known as "Ripmaul". It is now a threat to the safety of our forces and must be dealt with.
:Put Ripmaul out of its misery and I will see that you are rewarded.
;Progress
:Has Ripmaul been put down?
;Completion
:It is good that Ripmaul no longer suffers. Please accept this reward for your troubles.
