'''A Semblance of Normalcy''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Gather 6 Shrine Offerings.
*[[Shrine Offering]] (6)

==Description==
[[File:Offering.jpg|thumb|An [[offering]]]]
<Name>, we have to help the [[attendant]]s of [[Korthia]]. They have lost so much, so suddenly.

Nearby, in the [[Sanctuary of Guidance]], they would take offerings and leave them at shrines. Since the [[mawsworn]] invaded, they haven't been able to enter the Sanctuary or retrieve their precious offerings.

If you could collect the offerings and retrieve them. It might allow the attendants some semblance of their normal lives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
How are you? I have heard the Sanctuary of Guidance is overrun with [[devourer]]s.

==Completion==
How wonderful. We will return these to the attendants so they may once again participate in their rituals. It's important to do activities that bring us peace.

==Notes==
The [[Sanctuary of Guidance]] is just across the road to the west. Look for [[Offering]] doodads on the ground near the altars and elsewhere in the area.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
