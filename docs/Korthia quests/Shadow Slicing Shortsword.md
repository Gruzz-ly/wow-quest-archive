'''Shadow Slicing Shortsword''' starts from the [[Shadow Slicing Shortsword (item)]] on an altar floating out in the void after using the [[Phasing Korthian Shrine]] at {{co|39.4|42.7|Korthia}} atop [[Hope's Ascent]]. Get to the altar, pick up the quest, then get back to safety within sixty seconds or run the risk of getting dropped into the void.

==Objectives==
[[File:Phasing Korthian Shrine.jpg|thumb|[[Phasing Korthian Shrine]]]]
Bring the Shadow Slicing Shortsword to [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*[[Shadow Slicing Shortsword (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Your familiarity with [[The Archivists' Codex (item)|the Archivists' Codex]] makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.

Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this shortsword in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Shadow Slicing Shortsword (toy)]]
*500x [[Cataloged Research]]
*+500 reputation with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Completion==
Though the blade's shadow severing properties may appear to be no more than a parlor trick, I believe this is one of the most dangerous relics in our care.

==Notes==

The shortsword reads:
{{book|Shadow Slicing Shortsword|content=
<Though unassuming at first glance, at times the blade catches the light in such a way that you are temporarily blinded by its brilliance.

The shadows themselves seem to slink back from the sword, as if they fear its power. You note that the one of them appears to have somehow cut itself on the blade's edge.

If nothing else, this weapon is likely excellent at attacking the darkness.>
