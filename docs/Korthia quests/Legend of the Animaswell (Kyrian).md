'''Legend of the Animaswell''' is a weekly quest started from the [[Legend of the Animaswell (item)]], which drops from the [[Wild Worldcracker]] in [[Korthia]].

This will unlock a [[Legend of the Animaswell (adventure)|new adventure]] on the Command Table.

==Objectives==
Deliver [[Legend of the Animaswell (item)]] to [[Koros]] in [[Elysian Hold]].

==Description==
<This appears to be an incomplete set of notes detailing one archivist's search for a mythical font of anima hidden somewhere deep in [[Korthia]].

[[Koros]] in [[Elysian Hold]] would be able to help you put together a team to search for it.>

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
*{{Abilities|Legend of the Animaswell|id=357528|icon=icon_treasuremap}}

==Completion==
<[[Koros]] carefully studies the documents you brought him.>

The documentation is incomplete. It is unclear if the archivist even survived...

But the tales of the anima are coherent, and there is enough details here to launch an expedition.

It will not be easy. The archivist warns of many dangers protecting the anima source...

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Koros|Use the Command Table when you're ready to hunt for the Animaswell. I'll take care of everything else.}}

This unlocks the Legend of the Animaswell adventure on the Command Table, which rewards an [[Animaswell Prism]], worth 250 [[Reservoir Anima]].
