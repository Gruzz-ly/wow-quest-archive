'''Gravewing Crystal''' is a [[Venthyr Covenant]]-only quest that rewards the [[Mastercraft Gravewing]] mount. The crystal drops from the [[Stygian Stonecrusher]], at the end of the "No Stoneborn Left Behind" vignette on the southwestern end of the [[Vault of Secrets]].

==Objectives==
Deliver Gravewing Crystal to the [[Stonewright]] in [[Keeper's Respite]].

==Completion==
<The Stonewright raises one eyebrow as you hand her the powerful crystal.>

This is truly a unique crystal... Luckily, I know just the stonechild worthy of it. I trust you will take good care of her.
