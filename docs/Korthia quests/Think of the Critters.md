'''Think of the Critters''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Approach and feed hungry critters in [[Korthia]].
*Critters cared for (6)
*[[Korthian Treat]] (provided)

==Description==
The wildlife of Korthia have been through so much. Some of them can't seem to find enough to eat.

I've saved some extra food that we can share with them. 

But I'm worried that they might be too shy to trust us, and I don't blame them! 

Here. Take these treats and see if you can get close enough to them to feed them properly. Even small creatures are so important.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
All we can ask is if we did our best.

==Completion==
You were able to feed some of them? Wonderful!

I'll start saving up more food for next time. I hope that one day we can help this place heal, too.

==Notes==

Look for [[Hungry Gromit]] critters in the unnamed central areas of [[Korthia]]. Don't run up to them:
:{{text|emote|The little creature is startled and runs away!}}

Instead, dismount, activate the provided [[Korthian Treat]] and target the ground near the [[gromit]], then ''walk'' until the targeting circle is in range of the critter. Use the quest item to stop the gromit from moving, which allows the Maw Walker to get closer:
:{{Abilities|Wary|The critter is currently wary of you. See if you can earn its trust.|icon=ability_druid_healinginstincts|notes=40 sec debuff on the player}}

The gromit is buffed with:
:{{Abilities|Food?|Intrigued by your treat. Maybe you can get closer?|icon=inv_misc_food_legion_thehungrymagistar}}

Get within 10 yards, ''target the critter'', and use the bonus ability:
:{{Abilities|Offer Treat|Offer food to the Korthian critter.|icon=inv_misc_petbiscuit_01|range=10}}

Feeding the gromit may or may not spawn an attacker:
:{{text|bossemote|A scavenger swoops in to attack the hungry critter!}}

Defeat the [[Scavenging Razorwing]] and use the Offer Treat ability again until the bar is full:

:{{text|emote|The little creature loses interest and runs away.}}
:{{text|emote|The little creature is fed, happy, and grateful!}}
