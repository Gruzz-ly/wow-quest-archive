'''We Move Forward''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Collect 8 Plundered Anima from [[Scholar's Den]] in [[Korthia]].
*[[Plundered Anima (Korthia)]] collected

==Description==
It breaks my heart to see another land so utterly obliterated. I can imagine how beautiful Korthia must have been, once.

But we must not wallow in what we've lost. Like [[Ara'lon]] taught me: we don't have to stand still.

We can choose to fight.

You can help by taking anima back from those [[Mawsworn]]. We can put it to use, building up our own forces and defenses.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
I look forward to a time when we aren't always fighting for survival.

==Completion==
Thank you, my friend.

Every bit of anima we collect gives me hope that we can heal the Shadowlands. One day, we will be whole again.

==Notes==
Loot [[Anima Urn]]s in the [[Scholar's Den]] and the [[Caverns of Contemplation]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
