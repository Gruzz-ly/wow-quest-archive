'''Intact Aquilon Core''' starts from the [[Intact Aquilon Core (item)]], which drops from the [[Wild Worldcracker]] vignette in central [[Korthia]] for [[Kyrian Covenant]] players only.

==Objectives==
Deliver Intact Aquilon Core to [[Deos]] in [[Keeper's Respite]].
*[[Intact Aquilon Core (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<The massive [[devourer]] was clutching this [[aquilon]] power core in its fist when it died, no doubt ripped from one of the destroyed aquilon around it. The power core appears to be almost entirely intact.

Deos in Keeper's Respite would be able to help you locate an aquilon that you could power with it.>

==Rewards==
*[[Forsworn Aquilon]]

==Completion==
<Deos's eyes light up when he sees the intact power core you're holding.>

Thank the Archon! I recovered a few broken aquilon from the fight earlier, and one is missing its power core. I will restore it so that you may take it with you.
