'''A Matter of Urgency''' begins the "They Could Be Anyone" side chain in [[Korthia]], part of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]].

==Objectives==
Search for the Fatescribe of [[Korthia]].

==Description==
[[Maw Walker]], there is a matter of urgency that has not been addressed.

Our [[Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|Fatescribe]] is missing. They have not found their way here. They would have been in [[Seeker's Quorum]] before...

<[[Pathscribe Roh-Vess]] pauses.>

Can you look for the Fatescribe? Many [[attendant]]s used the caves near the ruins to hide from the [[mawsworn]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You are searching for the Fatescribe too? I must find him. I cannot fail.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Pathscribe Roh-Vess|The Purpose guide you to the Fatescribe and lead you both to safety.}}

Before leaving, Roh-Vess has some gossip:
:Greetings. I am the caretaker for the Waystone. Even before the calamity, it was my solemn duty to wait and watch, for those who might use the stone.
{{gossip|What is a Fatescribe?}}
:A Fatescribe is one of the most important attendants to serve the Arbiter. They are honored in their duty to the Purpose.

Head southwest past the [[Scholar's Den]] to a small cave immediately beneath it, where [[Caretaker Kah-Than]] is hiding out. Approach the caretaker:
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|A [[Torn Page (Korthia)|dropped page]] remains, but he does not. Where have you gone?}}

==Progression==
{{They Could Be Anyone}}
