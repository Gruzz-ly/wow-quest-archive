'''What Must Be Found''' is the first in a series of quests revealing some [[Korthia]]n relics that [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] wants the [[Maw Walker]] to recover for the [[Archivists' Codex]] faction.

==Objectives==
Examine what relics are missing within the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*Missing relics examined (5)

==Description==
There is much detailed in the codex. Items that are forever lost, and some that still exist.

Some powerful relics may remain, hidden somewhere within Korthia. 

Go into the reliquary. You will see some of the artifacts that are still whole within Korthia.

Commit them to memory. You must find them and return them to me.

==Progress==
Have you seen the missing relics?

==Completion==
These are just some of the relics that are missing.

You have the power to recover them, wherever they are within Korthia.

==Notes==
The ghosts of five objects light up on the tables and chests inside the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]]:
*Book of Binding: The Mad Witch {{co|62.6|21.8|Korthia}}
*Celestial Shadowlands Chart {{co|62.6|23.3|Korthia}}
*Rune Chit {{co|62.7|23.3|Korthia}}
*Singing Steel Ingot {{co|62.4|22.7|Korthia}}
*Talisman of the Eternal Scholar {{co|63.1|23.1|Korthia}}

All objects share the same gossip line
:This relic has yet to be recovered.
