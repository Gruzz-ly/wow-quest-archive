'''See How THEY Like It!''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Collect 12 Mawsworn Emblems.
*[[Mawsworn Emblem]] (12)

==Description==
Just thinking about how [[the Jailer]]'s forces breached [[Ardenweald]] makes me so mad! 

And when I get mad, I get even.

Or rather, I get your help with getting even! Slay those [[Mawsworn]] and bring back their emblems to show me how many you killed. 

I don't really care where you get them, as long as they come from those [[Maw]] jerks!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+125 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Those Mawsworn will get what they deserve!

==Completion==
That's a lot of emblems! That makes me so happy.

Of course everything will be better when we've gotten the Jailer himself, but this will do nicely.

Thank you!

==Notes==
Any Mawsworn anywhere in Korthia will work, including at the [[Scholar's Den]], [[Seeker's Quorum]], and [[Vault of Secrets]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
