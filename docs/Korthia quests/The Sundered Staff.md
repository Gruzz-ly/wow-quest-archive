==Objectives==
Recover the three segments of the [[:Lodestaff]].
*[[Lodestaff Head]] {{co|45.0|58.5|Korthia}}
*[[Lodestaff Shaft]] {{co|49.7|56.2|Korthia}}
*[[Lodestaff Handle]] {{co|45.3|50.3|Korthia}}

==Description==
[[File:Painbringer Volklana.jpg|thumb|[[Painbringer Volklana]] holds the Lodestaff Shaft.]]
I have no choice but to trust you with the secrets of the Lodestaff.

In the right hands, such as those of a trained Archivist, the staff can locate influential relics from the afterlives of the [[Shadowlands]].

It was split into three segments to ensure that it would not fall into the wrong hands. The invaders have found the pieces, but they are yet not aware of their significance.

Recover the pieces of the staff. Each segment is held by a different member of the [[Mawsworn]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==

Were you able to recover all three segments of the Lodestaff?

==Completion==
I cannot fully describe the relief I feel now that we have the Lodestaff.

==Notes==
[[File:Roh-Senara and Roh-Suir at Estuary of Awakening.jpg|thumb|Roh-Senara and Roh-Suir at Estuary of Awakening]]
Pick up [[Carving Out a Path]] before heading out.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Senara|Recover the Lodestaff. We will await you in a safer locale.}}

Before leaving, Roh-Senara has gossip:
:There is but a narrow chance of success. There is an even narrower chance of survival. Our future is in your hands.

As does Roh-Suir:
:We were utterly unprepared. Centuries of productivity and peace were shattered by these Mawsworn invaders.

At the south-middle end of the quest area is [[Painbringer Volklana]]:
:{{text|say|Painbringer Volklana|I've faced far deadlier foes.}}

Defeat the Painbringer for the [[Lodestaff Shaft]]:
:{{text|say|Painbringer Volklana|I... underestimated you...}}

[[Tezzerak]] can be found at the southwest extent of the quest area:
:{{text|say|Tezzerak|You shall not impede my search!}}

Defeat Tezzerak for the [[Lodestaff Head]]:
:{{text|say|Tezzerak|You... know nothing... of power...}}

[[Kavelox the Corruptor]] is at the northwest corner of the quest area:
:{{text|say|Kavelox the Corruptor|I claim your blood, Maw Walker!}}

Defeat Kavelox for the [[Lodestaff Handle]]:
:{{text|say|Kavelox the Corruptor|True... agony...}}

Turn in to the west, at the [[Estuary of Awakening]], where the attendants are again hidden under a rock illusion.
