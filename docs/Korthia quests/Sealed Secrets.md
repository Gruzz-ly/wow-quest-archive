[[Xy'lonu]] occasionally starts one of five versions of '''Sealed Secrets''' at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]]. The quests have the same text and objectives, differing only by the targeted area.

==Objectives==
Retrieve 5 Sealed Containers from <location> in [[Korthia]].
*[[Sealed Container]] (5)

==Description==
Ah, Korthia. What secrets will be revealed?

My associates have been hard at work, seeking to discover and procure various small items of interest throughout this broken land. Nothing of great importance, I assure you.

They have secured those items in designated drop boxes, and those now await pickup in <location>. Don't worry, they are locked with an impenetrable seal to protect both the contents and the deliverer.

Bring those sealed containers to me, and I will reward you handsomely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+125 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Do you have the sealed containers?

==Completion==
Wonderful, you brought everything that I asked for.

Again, do not worry about the contents of these boxes, they pose no threat to you.

Here is the reward I promised.

==Notes==
[[Drop Box]] doodads are on the ground in the quest area.

For the [[Vault of Secrets]] version, take the [[Flayedwing Transporter]] at {{co|60.8|28.5|Korthia}} at the Necrolord camp at [[Keeper's Respite]].

==PTR version==

;Description
:Korthia was once the center of knowledge and power in the [[Shadowlands]], what you see before you is but a husk of its former splendor.
:Though it is now in ruins, Korthia still holds many treasures. Some treasures must be safeguarded from [[the Jailer]], this I understand. But many of these items no longer have an owner and require relocation.
:My collectors have been placing the relics in safeboxes around <location>. All I require is an [[adventurer]] to locate the safeboxes and retrieve the contents.

;Progress
:Do you have the items I require?

;Completion
:I see that you have brought the items.
:Do not enquire concerning the contents of the containers. I assure you that such answers would not interest you.
