;Description
There is a commander among the [[Mawsworn]] known as Valdinar the Curseborn. He has single-handedly destroyed many innocent souls and his cruelty is known throughout the [[Shadowlands]].

Valdinar must be defeated if we are to liberate [[Korthia]] and achieve victory over the Mawsworn.

But do not underestimate our foe. This will be no easy task. You will surely need allies in order to destroy him once and for all.

Return to me when Valdinar the Curseborn is defeated and I will see to your reward.

;Completion
Well done, Maw Walker. With Valdinar out of the way, the Mawsworn will be all the more vulnerable to our advances.
