==Objectives==
Collect 8 [[Shardhide]] Talons, 6 [[Gromit]] Feet, and 1 [[Razorwing]] Spines.
*[[Shardhide Talon]] (8)
*[[Gromit Foot]] (6)
*[[Razorwing Spine]]

==Description==
[[Korthia]] is an odd place. The wildlife here is different, likely due to years of exposure to [[Vault of Secrets|the Vault]] and everything it contains.

Are you ready to try some experiments? We'll need a good stock of reagents first.

Near the [[Seeker's Quorum]], you should be able to find shardhides, gromits, and razorwings. Watch out for their needles!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+125 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Feel like taste testing my newest experiment? It probably won't kill you.

==Completion==
This needle is so long and perfect! Well done apprentice. I can't wait to get started on our new tests!

==Notes==
Look to the unnamed valley/ridge centered on {{co|60|47|Korthia}} between the [[Scholar's Den]] and the [[Seeker's Quorum]] in the southeastern part of the mainland and kill [[Shardhide Growler]]s, [[Swagsnout Gromit]]s, and [[Predatory Razorwing]]s for their parts.
