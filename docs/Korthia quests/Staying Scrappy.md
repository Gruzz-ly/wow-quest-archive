'''Staying Scrappy''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Collect 12 [[mawsworn]] scrap metal.
*[[Scrap Metal (Korthia)]] (12)

==Description==
Our army always need more weapons, armor, and troops. Always.

We're getting reinforcements, but I can't keep everyone properly armed at this rate. Especially without a full forge and assistants.

We'll have to make do with the next best thing. I need you to go get me any kind of scrap metal from the Mawsworn you can find. I'll figure out how to turn it into usable weapons.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
One day, I'll fight a campaign where we are properly supplied and equipped. It'll be the easiest war I'll ever fight.

==Completion==
Well, it's not the finest materials, but it will do.

==Notes==
Look for guard-type Mawsworn in [[Scholar's Den]] and [[Seeker's Quorum]].

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
