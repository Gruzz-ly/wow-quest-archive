There are several iterations of the '''Observational Records''' [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|daily quest]] in [[Korthia]], varying only by their location.

==Objectives==
Collect 5 Observational Records from <location> in [[Korthia]].
*[[Observational Record]] (5)

==Description==
Greetings, [[Maw Walker]], a moment of your time?

As you no doubt know, [[Cartel Ta|my cartel]] has quietly spread observational devices all across [[Korthia]]. But that data is no good to us if it is not retrieved. Which is where you come in.

The <location> records should be ready to collect. You won't see the devices themselves, but the data will appear to you as a bright orb.

Bring those data to me, and I will reward you handsomely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the observational records from <location>?

==Completion==
;Mauler's Outlook
:Excellent, this data will serve us well. We can begin to answer some of our questions about Korthia, and the [[Mauler's Outlook]]. Was it always home to such terrible creatures, or did was it something more?
:And here is your reward, as promised.
;Sanctuary of Guidance
:The [[devourer]]s have destroyed much of what might have been useful at the [[Sanctuary of Guidance]]. But this information will still prove valuable.
:And here is your reward, as promised.
;Scholar's Den
:The [[Scholar's Den]] must have been a much different place before the Jailer's chains destroyed it. It is hardly a refuge for intellectual pursuits now.
:This information is extremely valuable to us. And here is your reward, as promised.
;Seeker's Quorum
:The name "[[Seeker's Quorum]]" has puzzled me greatly since I learned of it. What are they seeking? What constitutes a Quorum? What did they do there?
:These mysteries may be beyond us, or they may yet be revealed. And here is your reward, as promised.
;Vault of Secrets
:[[Vault of Secrets|The Vault]] is reason why [[the Jailer]] targeted Korthia with his chains. Many secrets of the [[Shadowlands]] are archived there.
:If we can just get a glimpse of how it works and what it holds, that information would be most valuable indeed.
:And here is your reward, as promised.
;Windswept Aerie
:Places like [[Windswept Aerie|the Aerie]] and [[Estuary of Awakening|Estuary]] must have been desolate even before all the destruction. What interesting creatures congregate there.
:Will they all survive these changes? Will some adapt, and become even more fearsome?
:Here is your reward, as promised.

==Notes==
Look for [[Observation Device]]s hovering near the ground in the selected quest area.

For the [[Vault of Secrets]] version of this quest, take the [[Flayedwing Transporter]] at {{co|60.8|28.5|Korthia}} at the Necrolord camp at [[Keeper's Respite]].
