==Objectives==
Recover Korthia Repositories from the Korthia Rift for [[Archivist Roh-Suir]].
*[[Repaired Riftkey]] Acquired (optional)
*Rift Portal Entered
*[[Korthian Repository]] (25)

==Description==
Further Research has discovered that previous Archivists hid knowledge within repositories that were then placed within the rift of our world. 

It is imperative that we secure these archives. I fear that they are no longer safe within the chests placed there and that these shades of that realm will consume them.

Purchase or find a Repaired Riftkey and enter the Korthia Rift to recover the Korthian Repositories.
