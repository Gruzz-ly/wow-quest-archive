The drum reads:
{{book|Drum of the Death Loa|content=
<Bwonsamdi's face features prominently on the skin of the drum, pulled taut into a lurid grin. Every so often, you can swear you see it wink at you out of the corner of your eye.

The drum is cold to the touch, and it produces a muffled sound as if being heard through a thick fog. As it fades, you can just barely hear a low rumble of laughter underneath.>
