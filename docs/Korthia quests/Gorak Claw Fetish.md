The fetish reads:
{{book|Gorak Claw Fetish|content=
<The fetish is unmistakably of Drust origin and seethes with the foul magic of Thros itself. You do not know how it arrived in Korthia, or if the Drust are aware that it is here.

Given what you know of the Drust, it might be best to avoid examining the fetish for too long.>
