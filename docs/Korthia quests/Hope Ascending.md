==Objectives==
Meet [[Archivist Roh-Senara]] and [[Scholar Roh-Suir]] near the top of [[Hope's Ascent]].

==Description==
There is one final thing we must do.

Meet us atop the peak of Hope's Ascent.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I was beginning to worry that you had given up on our cause.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Scholar Roh-Suir|It is tragic that so many loyal Archivists are no longer with us.}}
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Senara|They served the Purpose as intended, and their wisdom aids us still.}}
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Senara|In time, you will understand.}}

Cross the valley to the north and head up [[Hope's Ascent]], where Roh-Dahl and Roh-Suir have placed the [[:Lodestaff]] on an altar.

Roh-Suir has new gossip
:I had never considered the concept of mortality so carefully until now.
