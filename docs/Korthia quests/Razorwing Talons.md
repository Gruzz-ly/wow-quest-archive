'''Razorwing Talons''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Collect 10 Razorwing Talons.
*[[Razorwing Talons (item)]] collected (10)

==Description==
These lands are not well known yet by my hunters, but we have discovered formidable beasts that reside here.

Among these are the [[Razorwing]]: vicious predators with terrible talons... and the temper of a [[vorkai]].

<[[Lord Herne|Herne]] grins fiercely.>

Bring me some of their talons to help teach our newest hunters about the kinds of beasts they will face.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +125 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Do you have those Razorwing Talons?

==Completion==
These talons are in excellent shape. And they look like they could take out an eye! <Herne chuckles ironically.>

I expect they will get a lot of attention from our [[Wild Hunt]] recruits.

Thank you, Maw Walker.

==Notes==
Targets in and around the [[Windswept Aerie]] and [[Estuary of Awakening]] include [[Frenzied Razorwing]]s, [[Razorwing Matriarch]]s, and [[Razorwing Nestguard]]s.
