==Objectives==
Speak with [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] to transfer [[Relic Fragment]]s to [[Cataloged Research]].
*Cataloged research received from Archivist Roh-Suir

==Description==
You have done well to collect these fragments. They will go a long way to restoring our archives. 

I can use what you have found to gather more research about what was lost within Korthia. 

Afterwards, it will be up to you to find more fragments and relics within Korthia to boost our archives.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*Item level 200 catch up gear
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Korthian Caretaker's Sandals
|Korthian Caretaker's Mitts
|Shardhide Leather Treads
|Shardhide Leather Handlers
|Razorwing Scale Footguards
|Razorwing Scale Fists
}}

==Progress==
We thank you for your aid so far, Maw Walker.

==Completion==
This should do nicely. The reliquary will improve with more research.

==Notes==
Speak with Roh-Suir:
:Well met, Maw Walker is there something I can assist you with?
:{{gossip|I found more Relic Fragments to aid our research.}}

Each artifact is worth 1 [[Cataloged Research]] and 1/2 of a point of standing with the [[Archivists' Codex]] faction.
