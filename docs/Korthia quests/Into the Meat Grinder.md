Lay the barricades at the northeastern end of the [[Path of Understanding]]:
:{{text|say|Emeni|We'll hold the line here. The donors will come to us.}}

A wave of three [[Mawsworn Maul]] come charging in, then a wave of a [[Mawsworn Siphoner]] and two more mauls. After killing units, Emeni or a Body Dismantler will do their thing:
*{{text|say|Emeni|I can do this all day! WHACK!}}
*{{text|say|Emeni|Good thing my sense of smell is dead. Ha!}}
*{{text|say|Emeni|We can always use more of these.}}
*{{text|say|Body Dismantler|Parts is parts... these will do.}}
*{{text|say|Body Dismantler|Parts to make a whole!}}
*{{text|say|Body Dismantler|Pieces to construct with!}}

After that, a [[Skullspike Devastator]] comes running. Take it out.
:{{text|say|Emeni|We're all full up, time to make our grand exit!}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
