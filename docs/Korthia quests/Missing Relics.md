[[Archivist Roh-Suir]] begins '''Missing Relics''' at Tier 2 with the [[Archivists' Codex]], unlocking four more relics to find in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Examine the missing relics within the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*Missing relics examined (4)
*Korthian Archivists's Key purchased from Roh-Suir

==Description==
Thanks to your aid, I've been able to recover more research regarding the lost relics from [[Vault of Secrets|the vault]].

I've gone over [[The Archivists' Codex (item)|the codex]] and believe there are more relics within [[Korthia]] that can still be recovered.

These were sealed within chests that I believe have been scattered in Korthia during the initial attack.

I've set up the missing relics in here. Commit them to memory. They must be recovered.

==Progress==
Have you seen the missing relics?

==Completion==
Please, do what you can to find these relics. We must not let this knowledge fall to ruin.

==Notes==
The ghosts of four more objects light up in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]]:
*Gorak Claw Fetish {{co|63.4|21.7|Korthia}}
*Guise of the Changeling {{co|63.3|22.2|Korthia}} (in the shelf on the wall)
*The Netherstar {{co|62.6|23.1|Korthia}} (on the high shelf on the south wall)
*Ring of Self-Reflection {{co|63.1|23.1|Korthia}} (on the table to the right of the claw fetish)

All objects share the same gossip line
:This relic has yet to be recovered.
