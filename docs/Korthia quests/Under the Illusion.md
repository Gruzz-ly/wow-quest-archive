'''Under the Illusion''' is the climax of the "They Could Be Anyone" side-chapter of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]].

==Objectives==
[[File:Fatescribe Roh-Kalo - Korthia.jpg|thumb|[[Fatescribe Roh-Kalo]]]]
Use the Fatescribe's Implement to dispel the illusion.
*Illusions dispelled
*[[Azodius]] slain
*[[Fatescribe's Implement]] (provided)

==Description==
[[File:Under the Illusion.jpg|thumb|Roh-Kalo and Kin'tessa]]
The [[Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|Fatescribe]] has collected the necessary items to create an illusion in this chamber. Fortunately, we can use his own implement to dispel it and reveal him.

He will be grateful to see a friendly face, I'm sure.

I must say, you've proven to be incredibly helpful in this task. I truly couldn't have done it without you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<The Fatescribe has been taken.>

==Notes==
[[File:Azodius.jpg|thumb|[[Azodius]]]]
A small circle appears on the ground in front of Kah-Than. Step in it, then use the provided [[Fatescribe's Implement]] to dispel the illusions to start a cutscene:
:''The Maw Walker uses the Fatescribe's Implement to reveal [[Fatescribe Roh-Kalo]].''
:{{text|say|Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|No! They have found me!}}
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|Indeed we have.}}
:''Kah-Than gains a red glow and transforms into [[Kin'tessa]], a [[nathrezim]]!''
:{{text|say|Kin'tessa|Thank you for all your valuable assistance, mortal.}}
:''Kin'tessa casts a spell into the Maw Walker, putting them asleep.''
:{{text|say|Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|How many? How many spies has the Banished One seeded among us?}}
:[[File:Under the Illusion - Kin'tessa and Maw Walker.jpg|thumb|Kin'tessa and [[Maw Walker]]]]{{text|say|Kin'tessa|You can ask him yourself once we arrive in Torghast. He is quite eager to meet you.}}
:''[[Azodius]], another nathrezim, appears.''
:{{text|say|Kin'tessa|Kill the Maw Walker.}}
:''Azodius nods.''
:{{text|say|Kin'tessa|Oh, and make it quick. As a sign of gratitude.}}
:''Kin'tessa and Roh-Kalo disappear.''

Defeat Azodius:
:{{text|say|Azodius|This... changes... nothing...}}

Azodius drops the [[Head of Azodius]], starting the next quest: [[They Could Be Anyone]]. Should players turn in the quest before looting the corpse, the Azodius' Corpse object spawns nearby, which also contains the head.
