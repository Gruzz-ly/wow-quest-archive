[[Archivist Roh-Suir]] begins '''Mysterious Rifts''' at Tier 4 with the [[Archivists' Codex]], unlocking four more relics to find in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Examine the missing relics within the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]] and purchase a Repaired Riftkey from Roh-Suir.
*Missing relics examined (4)
*[[Repaired Riftkey]] purchased from [[Archivist Roh-Suir|Roh-Suir]] (Optional)

==Description==
Thank you so much for your aid, <name>. I've uncovered more relics from the codex that remain intact.

The key to finding these relics rests within the [[Rift (Shadowlands)|strange rifts]] within [[Korthia]].

I should be able to craft a way for you to enter [[Rift Portal|these rifts]] and find more of our missing relics.

As always, I have provided you samples of what these relics look like. Please be sure to examine them before you depart.

==Progress==
Have you seen the missing relics?

==Completion==
Thank you for your continued aid. The reliquary will be restored, thanks to your diligent work.

==Notes==
Before looking for the ghost items, purchase a [[Repaired Riftkey]] for 100 [[Cataloged Research]] from Roh-Suir:
:Well met, Maw Walker. Is there something I can assist you with?
{{buy|I would like to spend some of our Cataloged Research on something.}}

The ghosts of four more objects light up in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]]:
*Book of Binding: The Tormented Sorcerer {{co|62.6|21.8|Korthia}} (by Kah-Vez)
*Cipher of Understanding {{co|63.0|27.1|Korthia}}
*Unstable Explosive Orb {{co|63.2|22.0|Korthia}}
*Enigmatic Decrypting Device {{co|63.3|22.4|Korthia}} (between the Guise of the Changeling and Sack of Strange Soil)

The objective now is to enter [[Rift Portal]]s in [[Korthia]]. Not all rifts are up each day, but there's at least one rift up on the mainland and one on the [[Vault of Secrets]] island. Find the nearest portal to a quest objective/rare mob, then enter it, and navigate past all the Rift-bound enemies to get to the quest objective.

The quest-starting objects are at:
*[[Book of Binding: The Tormented Sorcerer (item)]], [[Scholar's Den]] {{co|60.8|34.9|Korthia}}
*[[Cipher of Understanding (item)]], [[Windswept Aerie]] {{co|29.0|54.2|Korthia}}
*[[Enigmatic Decrypting Device (item)]], [[Seeker's Quorum]] {{co|52.0|52.6|Korthia}}
*[[Unstable Explosive Orb (item)]], [[Sanctuary of Guidance]] {{co|51.4|20.1|Korthia}}

[[Rift Portal]]s can be found at:
