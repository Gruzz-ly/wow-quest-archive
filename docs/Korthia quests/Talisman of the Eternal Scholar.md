'''Talisman of the Eternal Scholar''' starts from the Damaged Talisman object inside the cave beneath [[Hope's Ascent]] in central [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Bring the Damaged Talisman to [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*[[Damaged Talisman]] (provided)

==Description==
<The talisman is dented and spattered with muck. Whoever stashed this here handled it roughly.

Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this talisman in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
*250x [[Cataloged Research]]
*+500 reputation with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Completion==
Where... where did you find this?

<The Archivist brings the talisman closer for inspection.>

I haven't seen this in eons. I thought it had been lost.

==Notes==
Find the quest-starting object in the cave near the tunnel up to the [[Hope's Ascent]].

On complete:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Suir|Another for the collection. Whatever would I do without your aid?}}

The talisman reads as follows, once placed back at the reliquary:

{{book|Talisman of the Eternal Scholar|content=
<The surface of the talisman is worn smooth by time and the touch of countless hands. According to Roh-Suir, it has been passed down from one archivist to the next in an unbroken chain since the first attendants arrived in Korthia.

Whatever power the talisman once possessed has long since been spent. Only its sentimental value remains.

Perhaps that is enough.>

During development, the talisman instead read:

The Talisman of the Eternal Scholar

The mark of a Ra'zunesh Eternal. [[Ra'zunesh]], a [[Plane|realm]] of the [[Shadowlands]] dedicated to the archiving and collection of all [[race]]s of the [[Great Dark Beyond|cosmos]]. The brightest [[scholar]]s of [[race]]s were sent by the [[Arbiter]] to Ra'zunesh to add the knowledge of their world to the vast Collective housed there.

It was an utter tragedy the day that [[Maldraxxus]] was called upon to defend Ra'zunesh. It was found that a large force of the [[Nathrezim]] assaulted the Collective, assisted by [[infiltrator]]s that had been lying in wait for thousands of years. The Nathrezim stole the knowledge and destroyed the Collective, kkilling{{sic|remove if spelled correctly in the game.}} most of the Eternal Scholars, the leaders of this realm, before the [[Maldraxxi]] forces arrived. In the ensuing battle, many of the remaining denizens of Ra'zunesh were killed or fled, never to return to their realm.

Ra'zunesh remains a ruin today, the Arbiter choosing not to restore it's{{sic}} purpose.
