==Objectives==
Recover 50 Relic Fragments from rare creatures and treasures throughout [[Korthia]].
*[[Relic Fragment]]s collected (50)

==Description==
Much was lost when Korthia was pulled into [[Maw|the Maw]].

Priceless relics were torn asunder. I have seen creatures carrying the remnants of these items. 

They must be recovered.

Confront [[the Jailer]]'s forces and search what remains of Korthia for these fragments of our once glorious vault.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
*+100 reputation with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Progress==
I can piece together many things once I have the fragments.

==Completion==
These will do nicely. There is much I can do to improve them.

==Notes==
Kill rares and loot objects in Korthia to pick up [[Relic Fragment]]s. Any Relic Fragment-containing items already in the player's inventory will count. Don't actually turn in the fragments until the next quest.

Before leaving, also pick up [[Beginning the Collection]].
