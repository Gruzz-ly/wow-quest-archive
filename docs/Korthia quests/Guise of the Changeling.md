'''Guise of the Changeling''' starts from the [[Guise of the Changeling (item)]] item inside a [[Korthian Relic Box]] at the small cave under [[Hope's Ascent]]. Use the [[Korthite Crystal Key]], purchased for 25 [[Cataloged Research]] from [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] at {{text|neutral|Tier 2}} (neutral) with the [[Archivists' Codex]] to open the box.

==Objectives==
[[File:Korthian Relic Box.png|thumb|[[Korthian Relic Box]].]]
Bring the Guise of the Changeling to [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*[[Guise of the Changeling (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Your familiarity with [[The Archivists' Codex (item)|the Archivists' Codex]] makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.

Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this mask in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Guise of the Changeling (toy)]]
*250x [[Cataloged Research]]
*+500 reputation with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Completion==
Now this is quite a find!

The Guise of the Changeling has the power to convincingly modify the appearance of its bearer, but it has a mind of its own. The wearer cannot control the illusion, and the mask is wont to place them into embarrassing or dangerous situations.

==Notes==

On complete:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Suir|Ah, yes. One step closer to a fully restored Archive!}}
''Or''
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Suir|The Archive is in your debt, Maw Walker.}}

The mask in the shelf reads:
{{book|Guise of the Changeling|content=
<This mask appears to be of shal'dorei make... but it has been altered with forms of magic that you do not recognize. The enchantment upon it seems more mercurial and intricate than even the most accomplished arcanist's handiwork.

One can only guess at what this illusion must be hiding.>
