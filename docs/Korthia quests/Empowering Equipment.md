'''Empowering Equipment''' introduces Kah-Vez, who serves as an [[item upgrading|item upgrader]]. Among other items, he can upgrade gear awarded from the daily quests in Korthia up to item level 233 in exchange for [[Cataloged Research]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Assistant Scholar Kah-Vez]] to upgrade one piece of equipment from [[Korthia]].
*Korthian equipment upgraded at [[Assistant Scholar Kah-Vez]] {{co|62.6|21.9|Korthia}}

==Description==
[[File:Item upgrade UI Korthia example.png|thumb|The item upgrade UI.]]
The research you find can unlock many possibilities.

One such avenue is improving some equipment that you may find within Korthia.

Speak with my assistant nearby. He can use our research to restore this equipment to its former power.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+100 [[reputation]] with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Progress==
I will do what I can to aid you, Maw Walker.

==Completion==
This is the least we can do to help you in your efforts, [[Maw Walker]].

==Notes==
Players are ''required'' to upgrade an item. Level 1 items require 250 [[Cataloged Research]] to upgrade to level 2. 250 research requires 500 [[Relic Fragment]]-equivalent items, so get cracking!

==Progression==
{{Archivists of Korthia}}

==Trivia==
During PTR, the quest was named '''The Fruits of Research''' and had the following completion text:
:Maw Walker, it is a pleasure to meet you.

:I can help empower equipment you find in Korthia, as long as we have the proper research.
