*Windswept Aerie cleared (0/100%)

==Description==
The skies over [[Korthia]] are a dangerous place.

Not only do the [[Mawsworn]] threaten our forces; the native creatures are also openly hostile. We must keep the skies safe for our own winged allies and beasts.

Then, we shall have aerial supremacy.

Have you reclaimed the skies over the Windswept Aerie?

==Completion==
Excellent work, Maw Walker. With the Windswept Aerie under control, our flyers stand a chance of ruling the skies.
