==Objectives==
Commune with the Archivists' memorials.
*[[Memorial to Archivist Roh-Gema|Archivist Roh-Gema visited]] {{co|36.0|51.2|Korthia}}
*[[Memorial to Archivist Roh-Luda|Archivist Roh-Luda visited]] {{co|33.1|43.2|Korthia}}
*[[Memorial to Archivist Roh-Kiel|Archivist Roh-Kiel visited]] {{co|27.8|48.3|Korthia}}
*[[Memorial to Archivist Roh-Mah|Archivist Roh-Mah visited]] {{co|31.4|57.6|Korthia}}

==Description==
[[File:Memorial to Archivist Roh-Gema.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Archivist Roh-Gema.]]
We can restore the functions of the [[:Lodestaff]], but it will require the wisdom of the Archivists.

Not just me, but the Archivists who have come before. They were laid to rest near here. Given the scale of the destruction of [[Korthia]] and the likely possibility that this destruction will continue, this may be our last chance to visit their memorials before they are irrevocably ruined.

Visit the Archivists' memorials. Take [[Scholar Roh-Suir|Roh-Suir]] with you, so that he may take note of their messages before they are lost.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do not fear the Archivists of old. They are here to help.

==Completion==
I trust you and Scholar Roh-Suir learned from the Archivists.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Senara|Heed the words of the archivists, Roh-Suir. The staff requires both anima and wisdom to function.}}

Pick up [[An Infusion of Anima]] before heading out.

Roh-Senara has gossip:
:We are safer here, but it is only a matter of time before the Mawsworn find us.

As does Roh-Suir after picking up Consulting the Efforts:
:What secrets will we learn from the Archivists of old?

Upon interacting with each memorial, Roh-Suir says one of the following:
*{{text|say|Scholar Roh-Suir|Allow me.}}
*{{text|say|Scholar Roh-Suir|I have read stories about this archivist.}}
*{{text|say|Scholar Roh-Suir|One moment, please.}}
*{{text|say|Scholar Roh-Suir|Let us call upon the archivist's echo.}}

Roh-Gema's memorial is near the center of the quest area:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Gema|History forgets far more than it remembers.}}

The [[Archivist Roh-Gema's Teachings]] doodad has more:
{{book|content=ARCHIVIST ROH-GEMA, KEEPER OF TRUTH

An Archivist functions as a conduit for the transferal of knowledge.

However, the Archivist does not shoulder this burden alone. They rely upon the assistance of others who are faithful to the Purpose.}}

Roh-Luda's shrine is to the north, across the [[Estuary of Awakening]]:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Luda|Knowledge is nothing without understanding.}}

The [[Archivist Roh-Luda's Teachings]] doodad has more:
{{book|content=ARCHIVIST ROH-LUDA, RELIC RESTORER

The afterlives of the Shadowlands give rise to many curious, fantastic, and unstable relics. It is our Purpose to catalog, curate, study, and safeguard them.

By our ministrations, we will better understand the nature of each afterlife, we will comprehend how disparate souls fit in the fabric of existence, and perhaps most importantly, we will keep potentially dangerous relics out of the hands of those who would misuse them.}}

Roh-Kiel's shrine is to the west:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Kiel|Seek wisdom, but never covet it.}}

The [[Archivist Roh-Kiel's Teachings]] doodad has more:
{{book|content=ARCHIVIST ROH-KIEL, SPEAKER FOR ALL

The Lodestaff serves a unique purpose. It can effectively locate the rest of the relics.

Each Archivist is attuned to the relics they studied. When five pass their attunements to the Lodestaff, it can be harnessed to locate these objects.}}

Roh-Mah's shrine is to the south:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Mah|A secret is only as powerful as those who fear it.}}

The [[Archivist Roh-Mah's Teachings]] doodad has more:
{{book|content=ARCHIVIST ROH-MAH, SCRIVENER OF WISDOM

The Shadowlands are composed of multitudinous afterlives. It is no small wonder that the properties of some subset of these afterlives, and the personalities of those who reside there, would lead to the existence of fantastic relics.

Our studies, therefore, are not merely centered on the relics, but also on the beings with which they are associated, as well as their afterlife of origin.}}
