'''Bulwark of Divine Intent''' starts from the [[Bulwark of Divine Intent (item)]] on an altar floating out in the void after using the [[Phasing Korthian Shrine]] at {{co|18.5|38.0|Korthia}} on the western floating Island. Get to the altar, pick up the quest, then get back to safety within sixty seconds or run the risk of getting dropped into the void.

==Objectives==
[[File:Phasing Korthian Shrine.jpg|thumb|[[Phasing Korthian Shrine]]]]
Bring the Bulwark of Divine Intent to [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*[[Bulwark of Divine Intent (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Your familiarity with [[The Archivists' Codex (item)|the Archivists' Codex]] makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.

Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this shield in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*500x [[Cataloged Research]]
*+500 reputation with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Completion==
This shield is from the afterlife we refer to informally as the [[Inn of Forever]].

When one's spirit reaches the Inn, they hang up their arms. This shield was forever retired as its owner went to join the eternal fireside festivities. It would not quite be correct to say that the shield is imbued with their sense of duty and selflessness... it IS these concepts.

I am curious whether this shield could be used in the field. The results of that testing would be fascinating. Perhaps someday...

The shield reads:
{{book|Bulwark of Divine Intent|content=
<The shield appears to be incorporeal, yet it feels solid to the touch. Narrow cracks mar its surface, suggesting that it has seen heavy use. Though they have not been mended, the cracks appear to be sealed by some form of magic.

Roh-Suir mentioned that the bulwark derives its resilience from the spirit of its wielder. It is possible that the intentions of those who once held the shield live on within it.

You struggle to comprehend how such an item was crafted.>
