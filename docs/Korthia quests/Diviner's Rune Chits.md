'''Diviner's Rune Chits''' starts by looting various [[Relic Fragment]]-containing objects in [[Korthia]] after completing [[What Must Be Found]]. One of them will contain a [[Pouch of Rune Chits]], which begins this quest.

==Objectives==
Collect 20 rune chits, then bring them to [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*[[Rune Chit (item)]] (20)

==Description==
<Inside the pouch is a single rune chit. It rotates and flips as if moved by an unseen hand.

Runes vaguely reminiscent of the [[Vrykul]] language are delicately carved into the stone. On the back of the chit is an indication that it is part of a set.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Ancient Korthian Runes]]
*250x [[Cataloged Research]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Progress==
Goodness, is that a pouch of rune chits? How many do you have?

==Completion==
You have acquired a complete set of Diviner's Rune Chits!

This was one of the first relics that I studied as an acolyte scholar. If you cast the chits, the resulting scatter and orientation will answer any question you ask of them, though it takes experience and a good deal of intuition to interpret their meaning.

I never expected to see a complete set again.

==Notes==
Loot [[Relic Fragment]]-containing objects to find the [[Pouch of Rune Chits]], which starts this quest. Keep looting other Relic Fragment-containing objects for the [[Diviner's Rune Chit]], which can either be revealed as a [[Rune Chit (item)]] or a [[Duplicate Rune Chit]].

The chits on the table read:
{{book|Rune Chit|content=
<Esoteric runes have been delicately carved onto the surface of each divining chit. The Archivist's records state that a skilled runemaster can cast the chits after asking a question and obtain an answer from their orientation once they fall.

It is entirely possible that the chits hold no power of divination whatsoever, though you doubt they would have found their way into the archive were that the case.>
