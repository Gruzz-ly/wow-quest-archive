Collect 6 [[Fierce Gromit]] Fangs.

There's tons of interesting things to kill out here! [[Shardhide|Bears]], [[Razorwing|birds]], [[mawsworn]], and [[gromit]]s!

Let's start with the hoppers shall we? Go slaughter the fierce hoppers in the [[Mauler's Outlook]] and bring me their FANGS! I can always use more teeth.

I like the long teeth. Razor sharp fangs. The short ones are nice too.

==Completion==
EEEEEE! These are so good! Look how long and sharp they are! I am going to put these where they go right now! Thank you!

==Notes==
[[Mauler's Outlook]] is immediately to the southwest, and neutral [[Fierce Gromit]]s are everywhere.
