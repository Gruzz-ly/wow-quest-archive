==Objectives==
Search the [[Seeker's Quorum]] for the missing Fatescribe.
*[[Chamber of Tranquility]] searched {{co|43.5|57.6|Korthia}}
*[[Kizesh]] slain {{co|42.9|58.6|Korthia}}

==Description==
[[File:Journal of Fatescribe.jpg|thumb|Journal of Fatescribe]]
I came here hoping to locate the [[Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|Fatescribe]] or something to help me find him.

Evidence shows he was here and survived a [[Mawsworn]] attack. The only other place I haven't looked is a meditation chamber on the opposite side of the ruins.

It's too dangerous for me to head back into the Seeker's Quorum alone. Could you help me?

I must find the Fatescribe. It's a matter of great importance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Where could the Fatescribe be hiding?

==Completion==
[[File:Burned Incense.jpg|thumb|Burned Incense]]
Mad ramblings and incense. Weak clues, but they're all we have.

We need to search the [[Sanctuary of Guidance]].

==Notes==
[[File:Kizesh.jpg|thumb|[[Kizesh]]]]
Pick up [[Rescued from Torment]] before heading out.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|I will meet you in the ruins. Thank you for assisting my search, <name>.}}
:''Kah-Than walks off.''

South to the Seeker's Quorum, where Kah-Than catches up:
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|I would assist you, but combat is not my expertise.}}

While exploring the Quorum:
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|This was once a place of meditation and serenity. We would gather here and commune with one another.}}

On the southwest side of the quorum, look for a monument of a sword. Immediately behind it (not uphill!) at {{co|43.5|57.6|Korthia}} is a somewhat hidden mouth of a cave, the [[Chamber of Tranquility]]. Inside:
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|A quiet place of retreat. Yet he isn't here...}}

Inside, on a table on the southeast side of the cave at {{co|42.7|60.1|Korthia}}, is the Journal of Fatescribe:
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|Mad ramblings and paranoia. He suspects there are secret saboteurs. Preposterous!}}
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|Hmm... this passage mentions going to pray for guidance.}}

Further southwest at {{co|41.4|60.4|Korthia}} is some Burned Incense:
:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|Incense. This is from the Sanctuary of Guidance. I bet he's headed there.}}
:{{text|say|Kizesh|You should have fled when you had the chance.}}

[[Kizesh]], a Maw guard, runs in. Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Kizesh|Foolish... mortal...}}

==Progression==
{{They Could Be Anyone}}
