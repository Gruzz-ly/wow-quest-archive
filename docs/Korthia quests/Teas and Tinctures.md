==Objectives==
Collect 12 potential tea materials.
*[[Korthian Herbs]] (12)

==Description==
How delightful! What a lovely little spot of nature.

Have you tried the local brews? Perhaps a nice herbal tea? No? Well, let's try it together! Search about this place and bring back any herbs that look... interesting.

A good spot of tea, and then we shall get to work. I'll wait here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
[[Tubbins]]! [[Gubbins|Grubbins]]! What are the two of you up to? Not bothering the Night Fae again are you?

==Completion==
Oh my! I've never even seen most of these herbs. Hum, this black one looks a bit dangerous. This green one seems promising. Well done <name>!

==Notes==
Basically the entire zone map lights up as a quest area, with the exception of the [[Windswept Aerie]] and the [[Vault of Secrets]]. [[Korthian Herb]]s are everywhere.
