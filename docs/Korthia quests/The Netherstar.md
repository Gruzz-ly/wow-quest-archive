'''The Netherstar''' starts from [[The Netherstar (item)]] item inside a [[Korthian Relic Box]] at the northwestern corner of the [[Estuary of Awakening]]. Use the [[Key of Flowing Waters]], purchased for 25 [[Cataloged Research]] from [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] at {{text|neutral|Tier 2}} (neutral) with the [[Archivists' Codex]] to open the box.

==Objectives==
[[File:Korthian Relic Box.png|thumb|[[Korthian Relic Box]].]]
Recharge the Netherstar, then bring it to [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*Charge the Netherstar (0/100%)
*[[The Netherstar (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<You recognize this relic from [[The Archivists' Codex (item)|the Archivists' Codex]].

The power source is nearly empty. However, it could be restored with exposure to raw, unfiltered anima. Nearby fissures would do the trick.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*250x [[Cataloged Research]]
*+500 reputation with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Progress==
[[File:Anima Fissure.jpg|thumb|Anima Fissure.]]
It sounds like you may have located another missing relic?

==Completion==
When we scholars consider relics that are important to keep secured, the Netherstar is precisely the type of relic that we have in mind. Can you imagine how much damage could be done were this to fall into the hands of an... opportunist?

==Notes==
[[File:The Netherstar.jpg|thumb|The Netherstar.]]
[[Anima Fissure]]s are found inside the [[Estuary of Awakening]]. Interact with the fissures for 5-18% progress each. Interacting with them, will sometimes attract [[Ravenous Scavenger (Korthia)|Ravenous Scavenger]]s.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Suir|Ah, yes. One step closer to a fully restored Archive!}}
''Or''
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Suir|Another for the collection. Whatever would I do without your aid?}}

The netherstar on the shelf reads:
{{book|The Netherstar|content=
<The device crackles with an immense amount of self-replenishing energy. So long as it is in the Archivist's possession, it can provide the Lodestaff with sufficient power to locate the relics that have yet to be recovered.

How it is able to generate such continuous power remains a mystery to you.>
