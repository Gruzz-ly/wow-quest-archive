[[File:Flight of the Kyrian.jpg|thumb|The battle at Vault of Secrets]]
'''Flight of the Kyrian''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Assist covenant forces from the air at the [[Vault of Secrets]].
*Speak to [[Kleia]] to Begin Flight
*[[Soulfused Abomination]] shielded (6)
*[[Corrupted Colossus]] shocked (3)
*Allies healed (40)

==Description==
We've engaged in a heavy battle at the entrance to the Vault of Secrets! Our forces could use some reinforcement.

Please, guide my fellow Ascended to give support to our fighters there. 

The fighters on the ground can handle the clean-up, but they need shields and healing.

Good luck!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Have you helped our forces at the Vault of Secrets?

==Completion==
Sometimes you don't need to strike with force from the skies! Sometimes just a little extra help from healing is the best tactic.

Thank you, my friend.

==Notes==
Speak with Kleia to begin a bombing run:
:We cannot lose hope, even in the darkest moments. That's when we need it the most.

Controlling a Kyrian Ascendant, players have access to three abilities in the vehicle interface:
#{{Abilities|Healing Strike|Launch a healing spell for allies on the ground.|range=60|cd=3 sec|notes=Instant|icon=spell_animabastion_groundstate}}
#{{Abilities|Shield Shell|Fling a magical shield onto an abomination.|range=60|cd=6 sec|notes=Instant|icon=spell_animabastion_orb}}
#{{Abilities|Shock Spear|Shock a Corrupted Colossus with an empowered discharge.|range=60|cd=10 sec|notes=Instant|icon=inv_polearm_2h_bastion_d_02}}

'''Healing Strike''' and '''Shield Shell''' are ground-targeted, but players must specifically target the [[Corrupted Colossus|Corrupted Colossi]] before using '''Shock Spear'''. All three abilities respect line of sight, so make sure to not aim around buildings.
