'''Charge of the Wild Hunt''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Mount Aldermeigh and slay [[Mawsworn]] in [[Korthia]].
*[[Aldermeigh]] mounted {{co|61.0|21.2|Korthia}}
*Mawsworn slain (60)

==Description==
[[File:Charge of the Wild Hunt.jpg|thumb|Mawsworn in Korthia]]
Ever since I joined the [[Wild Hunt]] I've learned so much about how to fight and how to defend the realms. 

I admit I'm still learning. But I am so glad to be learning alongside you, and my [[runestag]] friend, Aldermeigh.

Aldermeigh is being trained to charge into battle with the bravery of a [[vorkai]], but he needs practice. Will you take him out for a ride, and mow down all the Mawsworn you can?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
We will fight to protect all the Shadowlands.

==Completion==
You and Aldermeigh make a great team! Thank you for taking him out and dispatching so many Mawsworn.

One day, I too will ride with the Wild Hunt, and we will right many wrongs.

==Notes==
Interact with Aldermeigh:
:The runestag observes with relaxed, intelligent gaze.
*{{gossip|<Ask Aldermeigh to do a trick.>}}
*:''Aldermeigh steps forward, turns around, does the /mountspecial emote, and returns to it's normal spot.''
*{{gossip|Let's ride.}}

Aldermeigh runs around the unnamed central crossroads of Korthia on a fixed path, and players have access to the following abilities:
#{{abilities|Polearm Smash|Slashes with a polearm, inflicting Physical damage.|cd=3 sec|range=30|notes=Instant|id=|image=}}
#{{abilities|Toss Trap|Toss out a poisoned trap, inflicting Nature damage.|range=30|cd=4 sec|notes=Instant|id=|image=}}
#{{abilities|Swift of Hoof|Increase run speed by 50% for 8 sec.|cd=20 sec|notes=Instant|id=|image=}}

While on the vehicle, lots of Mawsworn Assailers, Behemoths, and Guards have spawned, standing around waiting to get run over. Most killing will be accomplished with the ground-targeted Toss Trap ability, but occasionally the runestag will run over behemoths, which are conveniently in range of the polearm attack.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
