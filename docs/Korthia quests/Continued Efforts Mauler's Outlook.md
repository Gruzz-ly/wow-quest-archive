'''Continued Efforts: Mauler's Outlook''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Clear Mauler's Outlook of [[shardhide]]s.
*[[Mauler's Outlook]] cleared (0/100%)

==Description==
My Eyes tell me that the Mauler's Outlook is near the newly formed road from the [[Maw]] into [[Korthia]]. It would provide a strategic and tactical advantage.

Unfortunately, the area is overrun with shardhides.

If we can secure the area, it will provide us with a clear path to the west, as well as a point of observation to monitor [[the Jailer]]'s forces.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +125 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Has Mauler's Outlook been secured?

==Completion==
The tactical advantage we now hold is a huge win against the Jailer's Forces. Well done, <name>.

==Notes==
Fill the bar by killing:
*[[Shardhide Alpha]]s, [[Shardhide Den Mother]]s (8%)
*[[Shardhide Growler]]s (4%)
*[[Fierce Gromit]]s (2%)
*[[Shardhide Cub]]s (1%)
