'''Spill the Tea''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Find Tubbins and Gubbins.
*Find [[Tubbins]] and [[Gubbins]] {{co|36.6|37.4|Korthia}}
*[[Experimental Tea|Tea poured]]
*Tea tested (5)

==Description==
It seems Tubbins and Gubbins have gone off somewhere.

I do worry about the two of them. Be a dear and check on them. One never knows what shenanigans they might be up to.

I last saw them speaking with one of the [[faerie]]s from [[Ardenweald]]. They were discussing the fine art of tea making.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
It's a lovely day for a cup of tea in nature.

==Completion==
Ah, you've all returned safely. Wonderful!

==Notes==
Find [[Gubbins]], [[Tubbins]], [[Whisperdown]], and a tray of Experimental Korthian Tea on [[Hope's Ascent]], just past the tunnel in the middle of a conversation:
:{{text|say|Whisperdown|Just try a taste!}}
:{{text|say|Tubbins|I don't know. Seems like a bad idea.}}
:{{text|say|Gubbins|I try it!}}
:{{text|say|Tubbins|Gubbins no!}}
:{{text|say|Whisperdown|Well someone has to try it!}}
:{{text|say|Gubbins|Look! Maw Walker! They help!}}
:{{text|say|Whisperdown|Just the thing!}}

''Wait until they're done talking'', then interact with the Experimental Korthian Tea tray to pick up some [[Experimental Tea]]. Use the tea on the {{text|unfriendly|unfriendly}} Tea-ed off [[shardhide]]s running around:
