'''Enigmatic Decrypting Device''' starts from the [[Enigmatic Decrypting Device (item)|Enigmatic Decrypting Device]] at {{co|52.0|52.6|Korthia}} inside [[Rift (Shadowlands)|The Rift]] in [[Korthia]]. Gain access to the Rift by using a [[Repaired Riftkey]] at any nearby [[Rift Portal]], then head to the [[Seeker's Quorum]]. Unlike the other Rift-bound objects, the device is not visible in the normal phase of existence.

==Objectives==
[[File:Enigmatic Decrypting Device - in rift.jpg|thumb|[[Enigmatic Decrypting Device (item)|Enigmatic Decrypting Device]]]]
Bring the Enigmatic Decrypting Device to [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*[[Enigmatic Decrypting Device (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
<Your familiarity with [[The Archivists' Codex (item)|the Archivists' Codex]] makes it clear that this is one of the missing relics.

Archivist Roh-Suir has a spot for this device in the Reliquary of Remembrance.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*500x [[Cataloged Research]]
*+500 reputation with [[Archivists' Codex|The Archivists' Codex]]

==Completion==
Though I have only a passing understanding of its operation, this relic can strip the complexity of communication into a form that is free from subtlety, guile, or metaphor. Pure logic.

==Notes==
On complete:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Suir|Another for the collection. Whatever would I do without your aid?}}

The explosive reads:
{{book|Enigmatic Decrypting Device|content=
<The device seems to be of broker design, yet infinitely more complex. Roh-Suir has made mention of its intended use to "discern the true intent" of a given phrase.  

You are uncertain who made this device, but you suspect it may prove invaluable in the right hands.>
