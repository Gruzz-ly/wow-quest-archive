The Totem of Dark Tidings reads:

<While in proximity of the strange totem, you can hear a quiet voice murmuring sweet lies and maddening truths. Or are they sweet truths and maddening lies? Perhaps they are all true... or perhaps all of them are false. 

As darkness begins to cloud your vision, you quickly step back from the totem.>
