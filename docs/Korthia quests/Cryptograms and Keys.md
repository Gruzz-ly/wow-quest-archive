'''Cryptograms and Keys''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Retrieve 6 Stolen Cryptographs from outside [[Vault of Secrets|the Vault]] and [[Seeker's Quorum]].
*[[Stolen Cryptograph]] (6)

==Description==
The repositories of knowledge within [[Korthia]] have layers of security. For very good reasons.

Each vault requires cryptographs in order to decode and disable the barriers. They are, for lack of a better term, the keys to every secret.

Search outside the Vault for cryptographs stolen by the mawsworn and return them to me. So that I may keep them, and the secrets they protect, safe.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+125 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
We cannot allow the Jailer to raid the Vaults of Korthia.

==Completion==
I am deeply grateful for your service in keeping our secrets from the Jailer.

==Notes==
[[Cryptogram]] doodads are on the ground at the [[Vault of Secrets]]. To get there, take the [[Flayedwing Transporter]] at {{co|60.8|28.5|Korthia}} at the Necrolord camp at [[Keeper's Respite]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
