==Objectives==
Deposit anima at the [[Field Anima Diverter]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*Deposit [[anima]]

==Description==
Now, for the moment of truth.

Deposit any anima on your person at the Field Anima Diverter behind me.

With any luck, you will not experience any side effects - loss of anima, loss of consciousness, loss of memory. That sort of thing.

==Progress==
Were you able to deposit your anima at the Field Anima Diverter?

==Completion==
A resounding success!

I trust the diverter will prove useful, now and in the future.

==Progression==
