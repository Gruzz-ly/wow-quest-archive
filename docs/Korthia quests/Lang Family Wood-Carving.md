'''Lang Family Wood-Carving''' starts from the [[Lang Family Wood-Carving (item)]] on an altar floating out in the void after using the [[Phasing Korthian Shrine]] at {{co|42.3|56.6|Korthia}} at the westernmost edge of the Windswept Aerie. Get to the altar, pick up the quest, then get back to safety within sixty seconds or run the risk of getting dropped into the void.

The wood-carving on the shelf reads:
{{book|Lang Family Wood-Carving|content=
<Well-worn with faint etchings that were once deep and sharp, this carving depicts an unfamiliar event at some sort of ornate temple. The architecture seems pandaren in nature, but you know that no such temple exists. 

Is this a depiction of a building that has long crumbled away... or one that has yet to be constructed?>
}}

*This may be a reference to [[Liu Lang]]'s family. Additionally, the [[pandaren]] atop the [[Wandering Isle]] were considered Liu Lang's grandchildren.
