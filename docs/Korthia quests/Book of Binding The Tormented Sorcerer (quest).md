==Objectives==
Collect 10 azure pages, then bring them to [[Archivist Roh-Suir]] in the [[Reliquary of Remembrance]].
*[[Azure Pages]] (10)
*[[Book of Binding: The Tormented Sorcerer]] (provided)

==Description==
<You hear a muffled voice speaking from within this book, interspersed with crackling static. Though the utterances are mostly unintelligible, you can make out the repeated request to recover azure pages.

Flipping through the volume, you note that many of its pages are missing.

If the pages were retrieved, the book could be returned to the Archivist and reassembled.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[The Archivists' Codex]]
*500x [[Cataloged Research]]

==Progress==
I find these strange speaking tomes... discomfiting.

==Completion==
This appears to be a companion tome to the crimson book that was under the care of [[scholar]]s in the [[Seeker's Quorum]].

Knowing that this book binding was separated from its pages intentionally, I will stitch all but one azure page back into it before returning it to the archive.
