'''The Weight of Stone''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
[[File:Darkwing Legionnaire.jpg|thumb|[[Darkwing Legionnaire]]]]
Assist the [[Stone Legion]] in delivering supplies and anima.
*Talk to [[Darkwing Legionnaire]] {{co|48.2|44.1|Korthia}}
*Supplies delivered (10)
*Anima deployed (10)

==Description==
The campaign continues, <name>. The [[Stone Legion]] is here to turn the tide of battle.

First, we must deliver supplies to our allies. The broken land of [[Korthia]] means we are the only ones who can keep our troops supplied.

Second, we must deal with the [[mawsworn]] and the [[devourer]]s. I have a very simple strategy. We are going to drop anima onto the mawsworn. That will attract the devourers to attack. Either they kill the mawsworn, or the mawsworn kills them. Regardless, we win.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Have you completed your task?

==Completion==
You did it!

==Notes==
Find the [[Darkwing Legionnaire]] just south of the central crossroads of Korthia, north of [[Seeker's Quorum]]. Interact with the legionnaire to enter the vehicle interface:
#{{Abilities|Deploy Supplier|Deploys a Stone Fiend Supplier to land at a location below.|range=100|cd=3 sec|notes=Instant|icon=inv_crate_01}}
#{{Abilities|Deploy Anima|Deploys an anima canister to land at a location below. |range=100|cd=3 sec|notes=Instant|icon=inv_trinket_revendreth_02_red}}

This starts a bombing run, as the legionnaire flies south over the Vault of Secrets. While flying, some blue and red circles will appear on the ground. Launch dredgers over blue circles and anima over red circles. The dropped items do not carry momentum, so wait a little longer to drop them than would normally be required.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.1.0|note=Added.}}
