==Objectives==
Defeat 15 [[Mawsworn]] invaders.
*Mawsworn slain (15)

==Description==
While I abhor violence and prefer a reasoned response to conflict, there is no alternative here.

In order for [[Scholar Roh-Suir|Roh-Suir]] and [[Archivist Roh-Senara|I]] to escape safely, you must deliver a decisive strike to the Mawsworn who have invaded [[Seeker's Quorum]].

Carve out a path so that we may escape.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==

Attacking the Mawsworn is risky, but necessary. I pray they did not follow us.

==Completion==
You bought us the moment we needed to make our escape.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Sundered Staff]] before heading out.

On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Archivist Roh-Senara|Recover the Lodestaff. We will await you in a safer locale.}}

Before leaving, Roh-Senara has gossip:
:There is but a narrow chance of success. There is an even narrower chance of survival. Our future is in your hands.

As does Roh-Suir:
:We were utterly unprepared. Centuries of productivity and peace were shattered by these Mawsworn invaders.

Valid targets include: [[Empowered Ravager]]s, [[Mawsworn Harbinger]]s, [[Mawsworn Interrogator]]s, and [[Mawsworn Warden (Korthia)|Mawsworn Wardens]].

Kill a path to the three named targets for the other quest, which should satisfy the quota for this quest.

Turn in to the west, at the [[Estuary of Awakening]], where the attendants are again hidden under a rock illusion.
