'''Ring of Self-Reflection''' starts from the [[Ring of Self-Reflection (item)]] item inside a [[Korthian Relic Box]] on the southwestern side of [[Vault of Secrets]] behind a building.

The fetish reads:
{{book|Ring of Self-Reflection|content=
<Though unremarkable at first glance, a shimmering duplicate of the ring appears like a mirage in the desert when viewing its gemstone at an oblique angle.

You did not expect this relic's name to be quite so literal.>
