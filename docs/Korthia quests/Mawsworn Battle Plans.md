==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Lieutenant Voxiferus.jpg|Lieutenant Voxiferus|This imposing general ferries Mawsworn battle plans between the Maw and Korthia.}}
Retrieve the Mawsworn Battle plans.
*[[Mawsworn Battle Plans (item)]] {{co|40|32|Korthia}}

==Description==
Which is more damaging to the enemy, destroying a contingent of their forces or interrupting their communications?

Better yet, what if that communication allows you to best place your forces to ambush their reinforcements?

I see you understand. There will be a [[Mawsworn]] [[lieutenant]], [[Lieutenant Voxiferus|Voxiferus]], traveling from the [[Maw]] into [[Korthia]], by way of the northern road. Find them, kill them, and bring me the battle plans.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 [[reputation]] with [[Death's Advance]]
*+25 reputation with [[Court of Harvesters]]

==Progress==
Have you found and defeated the Lieutenant?

==Completion==
Again, you survive. You remind me of me. I will review these plans and inform our companions.

==Notes==
[[Lieutenant Voxiferus]] uses the western north-south road between the [[Hope's Ascent]] and the [[Mauler's Outlook]], not the eastern one just outside the [[Keeper's Respite]]. The lieutenant spawns around {{co|40|32|Korthia}} near the northwestern border of the zone.

==Patch changes==
