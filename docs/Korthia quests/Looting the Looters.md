==Objectives==
Retrieve 4 Korthian Artifacts from the [[Mawsworn]].
*Korthian Artifacts found (4)

==Description==
<The Mawsworn was carrying a [[Korthian Artifact|Korthian artifact]].

It's unclear what the enemy wants with such relics, but you suspect the [[attendant]]s in [[Keeper's Respite]] would want to see them returned.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Artifacts? Oh I doubt there would be anything useful to us.

==Completion==
Now this is special. This implement is used by the [[Fatescribe Roh-Kalo|Fatescribe]] in his work.

==Notes==
In [[Seeker's Quorum]] for [[The Last Place You Look]] and [[Rescued from Torment]], the first Mawsworn killed will drop the [[Korthian Artifact]], starting this quest.

The four items found on the corpses of [[Mawsworn Warden (Korthia)|Mawsworn Warden]]s, [[Mawsworn Interrogator|Interrogator]]s, and [[Empowered Ravager]]s are:
#[[Korthian Scrollcase]]
#:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|Hmph. That is clearly useless.}}
#[[Weight of Judgment]]
#:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|Little more than trash.}}
#[[Axe of Storms]]
#:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|That artifact is... actually, it does have some value. But it's not of use to us.}}
#[[Fatescribe's Implement]]
#:{{text|say|Caretaker Kah-Than|Ah, this is it! Precisely what we need.}}

==Progression==
{{They Could Be Anyone}}
