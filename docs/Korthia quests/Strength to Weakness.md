'''Strength to Weakness''' is a [[Chains of Domination campaign#Korthia dailies|potential daily quest]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]].

==Objectives==
Empower the lightning rod, then kill mawsworn.
*Lightning Rod energized (5) {{co|34.8|49.8|Korthia}}
*[[Borrhas the Cold|Borrhas]] mounted {{co|34.3|53.6|Korthia}}
*[[Mawsworn]] slain (50)

==Description==
[[File:Borrhas the Cold.jpg|thumb|[[Borrhas the Cold]]]]
<Name>, the scrap metal we've been recovering has some interesting properties. I have come to believe the mawsworn are imbuing their armor and increasing its durability.

Take this lightning rod. First, you will need to get struck by lightning. Don't make that face. You'll be fine. But, you need to also be grounded on mawsworn metal. The large chains embedded in [[Korthia]], near the [[Windswept Aerie]] should work.

Once you are... ah... energized, I will send a [[tauralus]], Borrhas to carry you into battle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*+75 reputation with [[Death's Advance]]

==Progress==
Did it work?

==Completion==
I told you it would be fine. How did the test go? I wish I could have seen the looks on their faces when their fancy armor was suddenly the reason they were being destroyed.

==Notes==
[[File:Strength to Weakness bombing run.jpg|thumb|The bombing run through [[Seeker's Quorum]]]]
On accept, players are buffed with:
:{{Abilities|Lightning Rod|Wearing a lightning rod, devised by Bonesmith Heimir. It should protect you from lightning strikes.|icon=inv_misc_enggizmos_02}}

Get to the [[Windswept Aerie]] and start running up the chain. Unlike every other time, stand in the swirlies to gain charges of Lightning Charge:
:{{Abilities|Lightning Charge|The lightning rod is empowered with energy.|icon=ability_vehicle_electrocharge}}

Stay mounted to move up and down the chain to get to the swirlies before the lightning strikes. After getting zapped five times, run back down the chain to find [[Borrhas the Cold]] near the base. Hop on to go on a bombing run. The [[tauralus]] has three abilities:
#{{Abilities|Tarualus Bayonet|Inflicts Shadow damage to all enemies in front of the caster.|range=40|notes=Instant|icon=inv_axe_1h_maldraxxus_b_02}}
#{{Abilities|Might of Maldraxxus|Knocks all enemies within 20 yards of the caster back.|range=15|cd=5 sec|notes=Instant|icon=ability_maldraxxus_warriorplantbanner}}
#{{Abilities|Thrill of Battle|Increase run speed by 50% for 8 sec.|cd=20 sec|notes=Instant|icon=ability_rogue_sprint_blue}}

The taurulus goes on patrol through a special phase of the [[Seeker's Quorum]]. The player does not have any directional control, so spam the bayonet, which serves as a forward cone attack. Once enough enemies have been aggroed, use the Might of Maldraxxus, a point-blank area of effect to knock the Mawsworn back and deal some more damage to them.
