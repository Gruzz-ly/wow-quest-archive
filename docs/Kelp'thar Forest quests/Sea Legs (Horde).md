== Objectives ==
Collect 3 Saltwater Starfish and a Conch Shell from the Sea Floor at [[Legion's Fate]].
*[[Saltwater Starfish]] x3
*[[Conch Shell]]

== Description ==
Greetings, <class>. I am Erunak, a fellow survivor of this savagery.

I'm afraid your travails have only just begun. The [[naga]] have been scouring these waters, attacking anyone that still lives.

You are not yet equipped to survive here, but I can remedy that.

Just outside this ship live a special breed of starfish. Bring me some of them along with a conch shell. I'll prepare an enchantment that should help you grow accustomed to your environment.

== Rewards ==
The following spell will be cast on you: [[Sea Legs]]

== Progress ==
Were you able to gather the items I requested, <race>?

== Completion ==
Here you are, <class>. With this you should find maneuvering in the sea to be nearly effortless.

Now we must get to work. There is much to be done in little time.

== Notes ==
The items are immediately outside the ship, fear not. Sea Legs "Grants water breathing and increases movement speed by 60% while in Vashj'ir."

==Progression==
