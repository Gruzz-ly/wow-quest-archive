==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Gnaws.jpg|Gnaws|These waters are far from safe!}}
[[Budd Nedreck|Budd]] wants you to use the Booby-Trapped Bait at the [[Rusty Harpoon Gun]] in the [[Skeletal Reef]].
*Explosive Grub fed to [[Gnaws]]
*[[Booby-Trapped Bait]] (provided)

==Description==
So, seein' as ya been so kind to me, I'm inclined to let you in on a special secret.

I've found the biggest shiney of all, no more than 50 steps from where we're standin'!

Only one thing stands between you, me, and great fortune - and his name is Gnaws.

Don't fret now - I've got a plan.

Gnaws loves his grubs, so I've loaded one up with that gunpowder so as to make like a trap of sorts, ya see?

Just set it floatin' up in the reef. Once the shark is dead, we're rich!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well?  Is Gnaws dead, <race>?

==Completion==
Amazing!

You watch the great white beast swim off into the depths and wonder to yourself if anything could ever take him down...

==Trivia==
The title of this quest is a reference to the theme song of the 1975 movie, ''[[wikipedia:Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''.
