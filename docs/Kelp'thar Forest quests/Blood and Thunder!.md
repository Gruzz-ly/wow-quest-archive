== Objectives ==
Assist {{NPC||Legionnaire Nazgrim}} in the defense of ''[[Immortal Coil|The Immortal Coil]]''.
*Defense of The Immortal Coil Complete

== Description ==
The time has come to make our stand, <race>.

We'll defend this ship to our last breath, and make these naga scum think twice before approaching it again!

For the [[Horde]]!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Hood of the Shuffled Coil|Bracers of Breached Integrity|Schooner-Savior's Grips}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Completion ==
The Earthen Ring has received my distress message and sent help - just in time it would seem.

Hopefully more can be sent soon. We are but few against a great many.

== Notes ==
Accept the quest, then swim outside. There's a few phases. Stick close to Erunak and watch what the legionnaire says. When he says to 'save yourself', swim away. Players will be caught by a Zin'jatar Abductor and taken away to be saved by Erunak and a few other members of the Earthen Ring.

On accept:

After fighting for a while, Nazgrim will call for help:

:{{text|yell|Hellscream's Vanguard|Grahhhh!}}
:{{text|yell|Legionnaire Nazgrim|[[Thrall's balls]]! They're everywhere...}}
:{{text|yell|Legionnaire Nazgrim|We are... beaten. Escape if you can...}}
:''Erunak swims off. The last stragglers, including the player, are stunned and captured.''
:{{text|say|Zin'jatar Abductor|What a fine ssspecimen you are.}}
:{{text|say|Zin'jatar Abductor|My Lady will be most grateful for my effortsss.}}
