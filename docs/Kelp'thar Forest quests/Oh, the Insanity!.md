== Description ==
So, I've been thinking'...

If someone's out-of-their-mind-guano-crazy, do they know it?

Case in point, I coulda swore that I'd collected a barrel of gunpowder from the cannonballs around here, but it's nowhere ta be found.

Maybe they're right... maybe I really have lost it.

== Progress ==
You want nuthin' to do with me, <race>.

I'm a touch... screwy.

My gunpowder!

You found it! I'm not crazy after all!
