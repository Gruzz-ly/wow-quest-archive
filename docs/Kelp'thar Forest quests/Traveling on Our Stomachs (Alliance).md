== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Succulent Crab Meat from {{NPC||Splitclaw Skitterer}}s.
*[[Succulent Crab Meat]] x6

== Description ==
I'll need your help if I am to get these men ready for battle.

Any decent leader knows that his men travel and fight on their stomachs. No food, no victory.

These soldiers are weak from their recent ordeal. They'll need sustenance if they're to put up any kind of fight when the need arises.

Speaking of traveling on stomachs, I've seen several crabs out there on the sea floor....

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to find anything for my men and me to eat, <class>?

== Completion ==
This should help relieve our exhaustion.

Again, we thank you.

==Progression==
