== Objectives ==
[[Nazgrim]] wants you to see what lies in the broken Alliance crate north of [[The Immortal Coil]].

==Description==
Listen, <race>. It's not that I don't appreciate the rescue and all, but this is a dire situation.

You have to pay better attention out there!

I was watching, and you passed right over a busted alliance crate.

There's bound to be something in there that could help me and my boys.

How about you get out there and take a look-see, hrm?
==Completion==
Sure enough...

This looks to be something that Nazgrim will take quite an interest in.
== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||78|}}
*2,700 [[XP]]
==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
