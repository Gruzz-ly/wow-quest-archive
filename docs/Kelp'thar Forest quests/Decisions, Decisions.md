== Objectives ==
You must use The Pewter Pounder to destroy The Pewter Prophet.
* The Pewter Prophet Destroyed
* [[The Pewter Pounder (2)]] (provided)

== Description ==
This is no magic solution to my curse! It's just a hammer!

I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid.

There's NO WAY I'm gunna use this to break my shiney - not after all I've gone through to get it.

<Budd pauses in thought for a moment.>

But that means I'm stuck down here for eternity...

I had just learned to sail, you know.

Ohhh... I can't decide.

Here, you take the hammer and I'll just set the shiney down and look the other way.
