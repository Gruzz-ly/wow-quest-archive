== Objectives ==
Find 6 Stormwind Seal Equipment.
*[[Stormwind S.E.A.L. Equipment]] x6

== Description ==
You've done us a great service, <class>, so I'm going to let you in on a little secret. The men you've saved today aren't your everyday Stormwind troops.

We belong to a special detachment of elite soldiers sent here not only to contend with the Horde, but to investigate the massive geological disturbances originating from the nearby sea floor.

I tell you this because our top secret equipment lies in the bottom of some of our wrecked ships here.

That gear must be retrieved!

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to secure that equipment, <class>?

== Completion ==
Everything here seems to be in working order.

== Notes ==
The lockers are often ''inside'' the capsized ships, but not all of them are.

==Progression==
{{Honor's Tomb}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
