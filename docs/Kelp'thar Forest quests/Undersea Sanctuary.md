*[[Erunak's Scrying Orb]] Used

==Description==
I believe I've located the author of your note, friend.

It would seem that he is in desperate need of attention if he is to survive.

I shall attune you to one of my scrying orbs, that you might see him for yourself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you familiarized yourself with the cavern's location, <name>?

==Completion==
We must make haste!

As you can see, his time is not long.

==Notes==
From the southern end of the Kelp'thar Forest, the vision circles players to the northeast through the [[Clutch]], then up in to the [[Deepmist Grotto]]. There, players see an orc or a human lying supine, based on their faction.
