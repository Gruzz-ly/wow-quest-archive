== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Legionnaire Nazgrim}}.

== Description ==
You have done well, <race>, but there is much more to do and I grow weary.

I have expended a great deal of energy sending a distress message to [[Earthen Ring]] leadership, pleading for their help.

I must rest if I am to be of further use to us here.

Speak to the leader of the men you've saved and do what you can to help them prepare for battle.

The naga are scouting the waters for us. It is but a matter of time before they return - and they will surely come in even greater force.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||78}}

== Completion ==
I hear you, <race>.

I understand the urgency, but these men are in no condition to fight.

==Progression==
{{Honor's Tomb}}

==Patch changes==
