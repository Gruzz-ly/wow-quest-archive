# Kelp'thar Forest quests

[[File:WorldMap-VashjirKelpForest.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]
'''[[Kelp'thar Forest]]''' is the first zone of [[Vashj'ir]], which is one of the two 80-82 level-up zones in ''[[Cataclysm]]''. Breadcrumbs to Vashj'ir come from Stormwind and Orgrimmar in an auto-quest which starts as soon as players step in to their respective faction's city. After a few introductory quests, players can choose to head to Vashj'ir or Hyjal. On the Call of Duty, players will find themselves shipwrecked in [[Seafarer's Tomb]] or [[Legion's Fate]] in the northern portion of Kelp'thar Forest.

Kelp'thar Forest is very heavily phased and is a directed-questing experience. Following the breadcrumbs throughout the three zones of Vashj'ir is straightforward, leading to a natural storyline progression.

The other 80-82 level-up zone is [[Mount Hyjal]]. The [[Mount Hyjal quests|quest chain of Mount Hyjal]] also starts from the Cataclysm auto-quests in Stormwind and Orgrimmar and drops players off underneath [[Nordrassil]], the world tree.

After completing the [[Shimmering Expanse quests|Shimmering Expanse]] and [[Abyssal Depths|Abyssal Depths]] portions of Vashj'ir, the next zone is [[Deepholm quests|Deepholm]], which is started yet again at the [[Earthen Ring]] earthshrines outside of [[Stormwind City]] and [[Orgrimmar]].

These quests contain subtle references to Rick Astley's song "Never Gonna Give You Up". Specifically, in A Girl's Best friend, the quest giver mentions that she is no stranger to love, and Mack remarks in Nerve Tonic that you would not get this (his alcohol) from any other guy.

After stealing the keg of explosives on "Can't Start a Fire Without a Spark", an optional side-chain opens up with {{NPC||Budd Nedreck||Budd}} at [[Budd's Dig]].
