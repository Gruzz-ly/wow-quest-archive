Oh fer the love of...

I know our survivor friend means well, but the lad's been severely traumatized.

There only be one way ta deal with these accursed beasts, an' that be a fine dwarven axe buried hilt-deep in the noggin.

Pile up enough o' their corpses an' they'll think twice before fiddlin' with yer tasty bits.

Mark me words <laddie/lassie>, them buggers don't like the sight o' their own blood any more than you or I.

Now git out there an' give 'em what fer!
