==Objectives==
Lure and subdue an [[Abyssal Seahorse]].
*Tie off the Seahorse lure
*Subdue an Abyssal Seahorse

==Description==
If you are going to be making it anywhere in this [[Kelp'thar Forest|kelp forest]], you will need a reliable mount. I think that I have spotted something that might work, friend.

Tie off a lure at the rope just west of us, and then mount the [[seahorse]] that it will attract.

Be warned, you may need to work hard to break the beast.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|60}}
*15,400 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Earthen Ring]]
*[[Vashj'ir Seahorse]]

==Progress==
The grace of these creatures is astounding. They will make the perfect mounts.

==Completion==
Amazing! You look exhausted. She must have really made you work for it.

Life should be a lot more easier down here going forward with a mount that swift at your beckoning. Congratulations, <name>!

==Notes==
After accepting the quest, head about 10 yards to the northwest to the ledge at {{co|45.4|46.7|Kelp'thar Forest}} near the rift and use the Braided Rope. The lure will swim off into the lightless reaches, attracting a seahorse. Swim up to it and hop on.

Hold on to the seahorse as it takes a tour around the [[Kelp'thar Forest]] by either swinging left, right, and holding on tight as prompted. Players start out at 100 grip and lose 20 grip each time they miss a prompted action.

Should you have problems completing this quest (for latency issues, for example) note that the directional pattern the seahorse follows is the same no matter how many times you have to redo the quest. You can thus write down the pattern as far as you get with each attempt and thus can anticipate what the next direction will be. You should be able to make it further with each attempt until you finally complete it. It is not clear if this pattern is the same for everyone, or if a new one is generated for each character attempting the quest.

;Success
: {{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|Well done, <name>!  I imagine your journeys beneath the waves will be much smoother from here out.}}

Rendel offers the next quest, [[Good Deed Left Undone]].
