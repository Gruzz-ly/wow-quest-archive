== Objectives ==
Gather 5 pieces of Stormwind SEAL Equipment
*[[Stormwind S.E.A.L. Equipment]] x5

== Description ==
I recognize this helm, <race>. You were wise to bring it to me.

The [[Alliance]] have a special unit, trained and equipped to explore and fight beneath the sea.

It would seem that they are in this region to do more than just defend against our attack.

There must be more of these down here, and if you can find them it could turn things around for the Vanguard.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to locate more of the Alliance gear, <name>?

== Completion ==
Well done!

Now, more than ever, we are prepared to face the naga!

== Notes ==
Head northeast to [[Honor's Tomb]]. The lockers are often ''inside'' the capsized ships, but not all of them are.

==Progression==
{{Honor's Tomb}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
