== Objectives ==
You must slay the orca, [[Blackfin]], to retrieve Gilblingle's Map.
*[[Gilblingle's Map]]

== Description ==
<A torn page precedes the latest entry, which reads:>

Our self-proclaimed king will stop at nothing to acquire my family fortune. He has threatened and harassed me to no end.

I can't take it anymore!

I've buried the treasure and fed the map to Blackfin.

That should keep my cousin's grubby little mitts off our precious heirlooms!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Calanoid Shoulders|Polychaete Leggings|Girdle of Calcified Blackfin}}

== Progress ==
You've discovered Gilblingle's family treasure!

== Completion ==
This item was highly prized by the local gilblin population - even coveted by {{NPC||King Gurboggle}}, himself!

== Notes ==
Look up. Blackfin circles the reef near the surface. Once slain, the map points players to a giant anchor, which is conveniently located just to the east of the ledge at {{coords|55|55|Kelp'thar Forest}}. Next to the anchor is a Sandy Mound.

==Progression==
{{Budd's Dig}}
