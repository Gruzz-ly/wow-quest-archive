==Objectives==
You must defeat [[Akasha]] to obtain the Horde Chest Key which you must then use to open the [[Sunken Horde Chest]].
*[[Horde Chest Key]]

==Description==
It is unclear what manner of creature scrawled the seemingly random markings on this piece of parchment, but upon close inspection, some of the obscure shapes begin to look like landmarks.

Scanning the sea floor, you think you recognize a few points of reference, one being a nearby sunken ship. If your guess is correct, there appears to be treasure of some kind near the wreck.

You cannot help but wonder what the scaly, serpentine figure on the map might represent....

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|80}}
*12,300 [[XP]]
*[[Bioluminescent Buckler]]

==Progress==
This slightly encrusted lock might still be functional.

==Completion==
You've discovered lost treasure!

Your mind reels at the thought of what else might be hidden in the depths of the sea.

==Notes==
''[[Gorrok's Lament]]'' is just to the northeast of [[Smuggler's Hole]]. [[Akasha]] is a gigantic sea serpent circling the shipwreck. the shipwreck is also used for [[Nerve Tonic]] and [[Ophidophobia]], which are followups to the Smuggler's Hole quest [[Can't Start a Fire Without a Spark]]. The [[Sunken Horde Chest]] is just to the northeast of the ship and is not inside it at {{co|57.8|35.1|Kelp'thar Forest}}
