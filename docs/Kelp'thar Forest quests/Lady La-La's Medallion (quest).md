== Objectives ==
Collect the 5 [[Medallion Fragment]]s from [[Gilblin Collector]]s and combine them to create Lady La-La's Medallion.
*[[Lady La-La's Medallion]]

== Description ==
Dozens of crude gold links make up this heavy chain.

Dangling from the center link is an opalescent fragment of what must have once been a large shell-shaped medallion.

You wonder if the other fragments might be nearby, and if the medallion can be reassembled into its original state.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Dreamfrond Skirt|Damselfish Shoulderguards|Prismatic Periwinkle Band}}

== Progress ==
You examine the chain, hoping it can be restored.

== Completion ==
The treasure was obviously crafted by the local [[gilgoblin|water-goblins]] for a female they regarded highly.

== Notes ==
Kill collectors, collect 5 fragments, then use the five fragments to create Lady La-La's Medallion, which automatically completes the quest.
