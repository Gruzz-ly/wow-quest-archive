==Objectives==
Investigate [[Smuggler's Hole]] in the [[Kelp'thar Forest]], then signal to [[Adarrah]] that it's safe to enter.
*Smuggler's Hole Scouted
*Adarrah Signaled

==Description==
Please, <race>! You must help me!

I've barely managed to survive, what with naga, sharks, and that horrible monster that attacked our ship.

I can see a cave that might be safe, but I don't dare try to make it unless I know there's air inside.

Can you make sure it's ok?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|80}}
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I cannot thank you enough, <race>.

I just hope this whole nightmare has a happy ending.

==Notes==
[[Adarrah]] can be found to the west-northwest of the [[Shallow's End]] at {{co|53.4|43.2|Kelp'thar Forest}} near an air pocket, just south of the [[Smuggler's Scar]].

Accept the quest, then head northeast to reach the Smuggler's Scar, surface inside the cave, then swim back out to signal Adarrah.
