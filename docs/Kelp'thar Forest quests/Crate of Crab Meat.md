==Objectives==
Take the Crate of Crab Meat to [[Adarrah]] in [[Smuggler's Scar]].
*[[Crate of Crab Meat (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
This crate, labeled 'Crab Meat', seems to have fallen from a recently sunken cargo ship.

Adarrah would surely welcome such a find, considering the ordeal she's had to endure. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|80}}
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you got there, <name>?

==Completion==
Why, <name>! What a surprise!

If anyone ever calls your character into question you be sure to send them my way.

I'll tell anyone who'll listen that in my moment of need you gave me a case of crabs...

==Notes==
While rescuing Samir and Mack for [[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]], or back out and about for makura on [[A Taste For Tail]], keep an eye out for a [[Sunken Crate]] on the seafloor just to the southwest of Samir and Mack's former location.

Also, the [[Clacksnap Pincer]]s drop [[Tattered Treasure Map]]s, which start [[The Horde's Hoard]].

==Trivia==
Prior to patch 9.1.5, this quest was a joke about infestations of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_louse Crab Lice].
