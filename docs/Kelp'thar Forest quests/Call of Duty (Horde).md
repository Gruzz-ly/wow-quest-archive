== Objectives ==
Ride the mercenary ship to battle.
*Ride the mercenary ship to [[Vashj'ir]].

== Description ==
Listen up, <race>!

A [[Vashj'ir|new landmass]] has emerged off the coast of [[Eastern Kingdoms]] and we are engaged in a critical battle for control of the island!

Victory there will leave [[Stormwind]] completely defenseless!

Now is the time to strike!

Report to the docks at once for transport to the battle.

Every [[warship]] is engaged, so you'll be boarding a mercenary vessel commissioned by the [[Warchief]] himself.

== Completion ==
Not exactly the battle you had anticipated, I'll wager. But a battle nonetheless, as you shall soon see....

==Notes==
*NOTE: ''Sometimes, the dialogues may bug out, especially on higher levels when different phases of the area are also available (Broken Shore intro, Stormheim intro, and BfA intro). Also, when only a portion of the dialogue shows, you can abandon the quest, wait a few seconds (since there seems to be some kind of a timer), accept the quest and repeat until the NPCs spawn correctly.''

Head east to the dock at [[Bladefist Bay]]. A number of {{NPC||Hellscream's Vanguard}} are waiting.

:{{text|say|Vanguard 5|Why must we ride to battle in some pathetic [[mercenary]] vessel?}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 3|The rest of the fleet has been sent to the region.}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 3|...their return is long overdue.}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 5|Hah! They should've known to send us in the first place.}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 3|Agreed, brother, but the Horde fights many fires these days and the Vanguard are few in number...}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 3|Fortunately for our enemies, we can be in only one place at a time.}}

:{{text|say|Vanguard 1|Strange... Just yesterday I was dispatched to [[Ashenvale]].}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 1|Halfway there I got orders to meet you all here. This must be important.}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 2|Have you not heard?}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 2|An island has emerged from the depths... just off the coast of Stormwind.}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 2|We're gunna take it.}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 2|And once we do, Stormwind's days are numbered.}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 1|An island rose up from the sea... within striking distance of Stormwind? }}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 1|This is no coincidence! [[Azeroth]] herself has cast her lot with the Horde!}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 2|Indeed, brother. It would seem so...}}

:{{text|say|Vanguard 3|Here, warrior. Eat this.}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 3|Your reflexes will quicken, and your stamina will increase.}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 4|Hah! I don't need your crutches, friend.}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 4|I've faced the best that Stormwind has to offer, and still I stand.}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 3|My axe has split as many Alliance skulls as yours, brother. Maybe more.}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 3|Hellscream will settle for nothing short of total victory.}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 3|Should we fail, he'll chase us into the afterlife to take his retribution.}}
:''Nazgrim appears, walking toward the members of the vanguard.''
:{{text|say|Vanguard 4|There is wisdom in your words, brother. I'll take that food of yours...}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 5|Aye, as will I.}}

:{{text|say|Legionnaire Nazgrim|Enough jawing! There's our ride.}}
:''The vanguard turns and salutes.''
:{{text|say|Legionnaire Nazgrim|That ship's been commissioned by Hellscream himself.}}
:{{text|say|Legionnaire Nazgrim|You're all under strict orders - No harassing her crew!}}
:''The pirate ship pulls in to dock''
:{{text|yell|Tugore|Step aboard, friends! Carefully now...}}
:{{text|yell|Tugore|There ya go, all aboard. That's right...}}
:{{text|yell|Tugore|And please. Pay no heed to the... uhh... diversity of our crew.}}
:{{text|yell|Tugore|Rest assured, they'll deliver ya safely to yer destination.}}
:{{text|yell|Tugore|That bein' the fresh piece o' land just off the coast of the Eastern Kingdoms.}}
:{{text|yell|Tugore|Alright then. Make ready everyone... here we go!}}
:''The ship sets sail.''
:{{text|say|Vanguard 5|Gah. This ship reeks of human.}}
:{{text|yell|{{NPC||Budd Nedreck||Budd}}|Ahoy!}}
:{{text|yell|Budd|I'm saaaailing!}}
:{{text|say|Mark Fearsen|Don't pay Budd no nevermind... poor fella's got a few screws missin'.}}
:{{text|say|Budd|Oooh... shiny!}}
:''Budd jumps overboard!''
:{{text|yell|{{NPC||Adarrah}}|Budd! Noooo!}}

:''The ship makes the jump to the Eastern Kingdoms, throwing a loading screen.''
:{{text|yell|Legionnaire Nazgrim|Hear my words, brothers!}}
:{{text|yell|Legionnaire Nazgrim|We sail to a virgin island, a gift from Azeroth to the Horde!}}
:{{text|yell|Legionnaire Nazgrim|Securing this land will win us our war!}}
:{{text|yell|Legionnaire Nazgrim|The enemy has fought well, for Alliance...but they grow weary.}}
:{{text|yell|Legionnaire Nazgrim|We shall crush what remains of them and lay claim to this land.}}
:{{text|yell|Legionnaire Nazgrim|From its shores, we shall conquer Stormwind, and with it any hope the enemy clings to.}}
:{{text|yell|Legionnaire Nazgrim|Azeroth will be reforged under a single banner!}}
:''Nazgrim walks over to the main mast and drops a Horde banner.''
:{{text|yell|Legionnaire Nazgrim|This banner!!}}
:''The troops start cheering. Later, as the ship closes on Seafarer's Tomb...''
:{{text|yell|Adarrah|Captain! Shipwreck off the starboard bow! There appear to be survivors!}}
:{{text|say|Legionnaire Nazgrim|What is the meaning of this?}}
:{{text|say|Legionnaire Nazgrim|We have a battle to win!}}
:{{text|say|Mark Fearsen|What the... ?}}
:''Giant tentacles attack the shipwreck, throwing the survivors into the water!''
:{{text|yell|Legionnaire Nazgrim|Stand your guard, brothers! Make it bleed!}}

''Subsequently, as the ship closes on Seafarer's Tomb, a shipwreck with [[Gerok]], [[Bootstrap Blingbuckle]], [[Kurzel]], and [[Tanzar]] appears. A scene plays with giant tentacles attacking the shipwreck, throwing the survivors into the water! The tentacles then turn on the mercenary ship, grabbing the adventurer. After a while, the screen fades to black, and the player emerges in the [[Immortal Coil]] next to [[Erunak Stonespeaker]].''

;Around the loading screen
:{{text|say|Mark Fearsen|Aww Bud, now what'd ya go an' do that for?}}
:{{text|say|Vanguard 5|Hah! Humans...}}

;Tentacles
:''The tentacles turn on the mercenary ship, grabbing everyone, flinging them around then tossing them into the water, stunning them, including the player. Sinking, other drowning warriors are getting taken off by Zin'jatar raiders. One attempts to attack the player, but {{NPC||Erunak Stonespeaker}} appears and kills it.''
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|To the depths with you, beast!}}
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|Hold on, <race>!}}
:''Erunak casts a bubble spell that lets the player breathe, then the screen fades to black. The player then awakes in an overturned ship, the ''[[Immortal Coil]]''...''
