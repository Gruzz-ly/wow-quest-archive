==Objectives==
Collect 7 Wiggleweed Sprouts from the [[Holding Pens]].
*[[Wiggleweed Sprout]] (7)

==Description==
Wha... what IS this?

There's great pain growing... from deep in my bowels.

I think... ugh... they must have poisoned me!

They fed us strangely glowing seaweed that they grow around their stronghold...

I think these cramps will worsen if I don't get more soon...

Please, <race>. Try to find me some!

==Progress==
Were you able to find me any of their seaweed, <race>?

==Completion==
Yes, yes. This is the stuff.

Maybe I can gradually eat less of it and avoid that side-effect.

Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Decompression]] and [[Come Hell or High Water]] before heading out. Take note of the [[Naga Tridents]]  at {{co|60.4|69.8|Kelp'thar Forest}} between the grotto and the clutch proper. They start [[How Disarming]].

[[Shimmerspine Harvester]]s and any Zin'jatar naga could have the Wiggleweed on them.

Before heading back to the grotto to turn in, complete [[Come Hell or High Water]] automatically by killing the 12 naga and pick up Erunak's quest [[The Warden's Time]]. Kill [[Warden Azjakir]], then head back to the grotto.
