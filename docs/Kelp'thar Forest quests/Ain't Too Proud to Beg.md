==Objectives==
Find [[Samir]] and [[Mack Fearsen|Mack]].
*Mack and Samir rescued

==Description==
Now that you've brought me to safety, I'm afraid I must impose upon your kindness just a bit further.

The captain of our ship, Samir, is still out there. Mack too. I'm sure they made it to the sea floor but beyond that I didn't see what became of them.

I simply couldn't get by in a place like this without their help.

I lost sight of them in a clump of kelp west of where you found me.

Please hurry! They couldn't have gotten far...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|80}}
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well, <name>?  Did you find them?

==Completion==
Where would we be without you, <race>!

I don't want to even imagine!

==Notes==
After swimming out of the cave, keep heading southwest out of the cave. Samir and Mack are at {{co|48.2|39.7|Kelp'thar Forest}}
:I need to find a safe place soon.
:Ol' Mack's not doin' so well.
{{gossip|''Make for that cave to the east. It's safe and dry.''}}
:{{text|say|Captain Samir|Thanks, friend. We owe ya one.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Samir|Hang in there, Mack...}}
: ''Samir ties a rope between the two and tows Mack to the cave.''

While out at Samir and Mack's air vent... notice the [[Sunken Crate]] at {{co|47.7|40.9|Kelp'thar Forest}} about 50 yards to the southwest... it starts [[Crate of Crab Meat]]. The crate is most likely guarded by a [[Clacksnap Pincer]]. Kill one to collect the [[Tattered Treasure Map]] it has, which starts [[The Horde's Hoard]].
