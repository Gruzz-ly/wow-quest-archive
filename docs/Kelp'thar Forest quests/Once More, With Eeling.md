== Objectives ==
Kill 8 of any [[Eel]] in the [[Kelp'thar Forest]].
* Disgusting Eels Justifiably Slain (8)

== Description ==
Eels are among the creepiest of [[Azeroth]]'s creatures.

Sure, there are those who pretend that they don't mind them - and others who actually claim to favor them.

They are lying.

Truth to be told, no one likes eels. Eels don't even like eels.

Azeroth would be a better place if no one ever had to envision an eel slithering out from the murky depths and biting them.

In the face.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Completion ==
You can add this to the list of things you can tell your grandchildren that you've done for them.

== Notes ==
This quest is automatically offered upon the death of any eel in Kelp'thar Forest.

==Progression==
