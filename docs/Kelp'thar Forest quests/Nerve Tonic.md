== Objectives ==
{{NPC||Mack Fearsen||Mack}} wants you to collect 5 Sunken Cargo in the [[Kelp'thar Forest]].
*[[Sunken Cargo]] x5

== Description ==
How am I feelin', you ask?

Well, after bein' yanked from the deck of our ship by a giant sea monster and then left to drown in the sea... not so good!

My nerves are gettin' the best of me, to be honest.

If you could round up some of the supplies that are sure to be floatin' around the nearby wrecks, I could likely whip up somethin' that'll take the edge off...

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will receive {{cost|7|80}}
|q=10|Mack's Deep Sea Grog}}

== Progress ==
Were ya able to grab some supplies, <race>?

== Completion ==
I trust we both know what's been going on inside these crates...

That's right... ferrrmenntation! Here y'are. My personal secret recipe.

You wouldn't get this from any other guy!

== Gains ==
* 12,300 [[XP]]

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Ophidophobia]] from {{NPC||Adarrah}} before heading out and make sure to start [[The Horde's Hoard]] from the [[Tattered Treasure Map]] as well.

The supplies are floating all around ''[[Gorrok's Lament]]'', just northeast of [[Smuggler's Hole]].

==Progression==
{{:Smuggler's Hole quest chain}}
