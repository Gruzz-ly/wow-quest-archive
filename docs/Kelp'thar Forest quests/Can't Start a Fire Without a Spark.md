==Objectives==
Get the Keg of Gunpowder from [[Budd's Dig]].
*[[Keg of Gunpowder]]

==Description==
[[Mack Fearsen|Mack]]'s still out of it, and I fear we may lose him if I can't get this fire started. With the wood being soaked, we'll need something special to get it going.

There's an abandoned camp nearby with a barrel of explosives in it. There's no way I can recover it on my own.

Would you mind hauling it back for us? For Mack?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|80}}
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you get the explosives from the camp, <class>?

==Completion==
Outstanding!

Let's see if this does the trick....

Stand back, <name>!

==Notes==
Exit the cave and turn left. Budd's Dig is 30 yards away. At the dig, the Keg of Gunpowder is situated next to the tent at {{co|55.5|38.8|Kelp'thar Forest}}

On complete:

:''Samir throws the keg on the pile of wood, lighting it!''

Mack and Adarrah offer quests, [[Ophidophobia]] and [[Nerve Tonic]], respectively, upon completion of this quest. Additionally [[Budd Nedreck|Budd]] shows up outside the cave at his camp with [[Oh, the Insanity!]]

==Trivia==
The name of the quest is taken from the chorus of {{wplink|Bruce Springsteen}}'s hit song ''{{wplink|Dancing in the Dark}}''.
