== Description ==
As we struggled to not drown, my men and I were forced to abandon our weapons and much of our armor.

{{NPC||Erunak Stonespeaker||Erunak}} says to expect a major attack from the naga soon and I'm inclined to believe him.

If we're going to stand a chance, we'll need your help to recover our lost armaments. They should be lying on the sea floor near our shipwrecks.

Hurry, <race>, we're defenseless here.

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Leftover Leggings|Scavenged Stormwind Spaulders|Captain Taylor's Chopper}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Have you recovered our gear, <race>?

== Completion ==
Well done, <class>!

Thanks to you, my men will be ready to confront the enemy when they attack.

== Notes ==
Loot objects, or kill gilgoblins.

;Stormwind Soldier
* At least now we have a fighting chance, thanks to you.
* I may fall, but I'll take a dozen of those beasts with me!
* Bring on the naga!  I'm hungry for battle!
* The naga must pay for what they've done here!
* Time for revenge!
