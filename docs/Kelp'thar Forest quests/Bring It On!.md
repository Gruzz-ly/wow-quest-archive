Speak with [[Legionnaire Nazgrim]] aboard the [[The Immortal Coil|Immortal Coil]]. 

== Description ==
No sense waiting around for the naga to discover us here. We're bringing the fight to them!

I dropped my flare gun as I was sinking. I should have landed north of here.

I need you to recover it while we discover how to make this Alliance equipment work.

You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

Good work, <race>.

I'll ready the Vanguard.

The gun is ''west'' of the ship at {{coords|36.1|26.8|Kelp'thar Forest}}
