==Objectives==
Collect 5 Orgrimmar Axes, 5 Orgrimmar Breastplates and 5 Orgrimmar Helms from the sea floor and from [[Gilblin Plunderer]]s in [[Legion's Fate]].
*[[Orgrimmar Axe (quest item)]] (5)
*[[Orgrimmar Breastplate]] (5)
*[[Orgrimmar Helm]] (5)

== Description ==
As we struggled to not drown, my orcs and I were forced to abandon our weapons and much of our armor.

{{NPC||Erunak Stonespeaker||Erunak}} says to expect a major attack from the naga soon and I'm inclined to believe him.

If we're going to stand a chance, we'll need your help to recover our lost equipment.

You should find it scattered around the sea floor near our shipwrecks here and to the north.

Make haste, <race>. The enemy could arrive at any moment.

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Shipwrecked Leggings|Whelk Shell Shoulderguards|Legionnaire Nazgrim's Hacker}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to gather up our gear, <race>?

== Completion ==
You have done well, <race>.

Our chances of survival are increasing.

== Notes ==
Loot objects, or kill gilgoblins. While out exploring, head just northwest of the ''[[Immortal Coil]]'' to find the [[Alliance S.E.A.L. Equipment]] at {{coords|38.9|26.8|Kelp'thar Forest}} inside a broken crate. It starts [[Helm's Deep]], which is mandatory to continue the chain.

==Progression==
{{Honor's Tomb}}
