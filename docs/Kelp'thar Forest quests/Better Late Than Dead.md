==Objectives==
Use Moanah's Baitstick on a [[Speckled Sea Turtle]] and ride it back to her.
*Sea Turtle Mounted
*[[Moanah's Baitstick]] (provided)

==Description==
Greetings, friend.

It is good to see that you survived your battle in one piece.

While Erunak tries to scry a place of safety for us all, I shall assist you in securing a less strenuous means of transport.

I have prepared this baitstick to use near a sea turtle. It is crude, but it should serve to bring one under your control.

Once you've become comfortable with the animal, simply guide it back here to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12,300 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Earthen Ring]]

==Progress==
Were you able to tame a sea turtle, <name>?

==Completion==
How unfortunate...

Well, all things considered, it is good to see that you made it back unharmed.

==Notes==
Swim east to the nearest turtle and use the item within five yards of it. Once mounted, start swimming, slowly, back to camp. The vehicle UI provides a "Giddyup!" command that increases swim speed by 100% for 3 seconds with a 10-second cooldown. Suddenly, a Frenzied Sea Shark attacks and kills the mount!
