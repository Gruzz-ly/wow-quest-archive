== Objectives ==
{{NPC||Erunak Stonespeaker||Erunak}} in [[The Briny Cutter]] wants you to bring him 3 Saltwater Starfish and a Conch Shell from [[Seafarer's Tomb]].
*[[Saltwater Starfish]] x3
*[[Conch Shell]]

== Description ==
Welcome to The Briny Cutter, <class>.

I am Erunak, the last surviving passenger of this once-proud vessel.

I'm afraid your travails have only just begun. The naga have been attacking here relentlessly.

You're not equipped to be of much help down here yet, but I can remedy that.

Just outside this ship live a special breed of starfish. Bring me some of them along with a conch shell. I'll prepare an enchantment that should help to increase your chances of survival.

== Rewards ==
The following spell will be cast on you: [[Sea Legs]]

You will also receive: 12,300 experience

== Progress ==
It is good to see that you're still alive, <race>.

Have you found the items I require?

== Completion ==
Here you are, <class>. With this you should find maneuvering in the sea to be nearly effortless.

Now we must get to work. There is much to be done in little time.

== Notes ==
The items are immediately outside the ship, fear not. Sea Legs "Grants water breathing and increases sea floor movement speed by 60% while in Vashj'ir."

==Progression==
{{Honor's Tomb}}
