== Objectives ==
Assist {{NPC||Taylor||Captain Taylor}} in the defense of [[Briny Cutter|The Briny Cutter]].
*Defense of the Briny Cutter Complete

== Description ==
This is it.

This is where we make our stand.

We must defend this ship to our last breath, and make these cretin think twice before attacking it again!

May our blades strike fear in their hearts!

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Cowl of the Lost Cutter|Bracers of the Sunken Dream|Wheelman's Shattered Grasp}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Completion ==
The Earthen Ring has received my distress message and sent help - just in time it would seem.

Hopefully more can be sent soon. We are but few against a great many.

== Notes ==
Accept the quest, then swim outside. There's a few phases. Stick close to Erunak and watch what the captain says. When he says to 'save yourself', swim away. Players will be caught by a Zin'jatar Abductor and taken away to be saved by Erunak and a few other members of the Earthen Ring.

On accept:
:{{text|yell|Captain Taylor|To battle, men!}}
:{{text|yell|Stormwind Soldier|For Stormwind!}}

After fighting for a while, Taylor will call for help:
:{{text|yell|Captain Taylor|There are too many! Shaman, do something!}}
:''Erunak floats up and kills all of the naga with lightning.''
:{{text|yell|Captain Taylor|Rest while you can, men. That wasn't the last of them....}}
:''The next wave attacks!''
:{{text|yell|Captain Taylor|Brace yourselves, men!}}
:{{text|yell|Captain Taylor|Make them pay!}}
:''After some time, a SEAL or two gets captured.''
:{{text|yell|Captain Taylor|Stay alert! Don't let them drag you away!}}
:{{text|yell|Stormwind Seal|No! Ahhhhh.....}}
:{{text|yell|Captain Taylor|Don't give up! Fight! Fight for the Alliance!}}
:{{text|yell|Stormwind Seal|Gah... heeelp!}}
:{{text|yell|Captain Taylor|Their numbers are... endless...}}
:{{text|yell|Captain Taylor|My men - they're all taken... Go! Save yourselves!}}
:''Erunak swims off. The last stragglers, including the player, are stunned and captured.''
:{{text|say|Zin'jatar Abductor|What a fine ssspecimen you are.}}
:{{text|say|Zin'jatar Abductor|My Lady will be most grateful for my effortsss.}}
:''After swimming for a bit, Erunak and two other members of the Earthen Ring appear to save the player by killing the abductor!''
:{{text|say|Erunak Stonespeaker|We were most fortunate to escape, <name>. Follow me.}}
:''The party swims to [[Shallow's End]].''
