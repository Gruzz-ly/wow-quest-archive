==Objectives==
Take the Soggy Note to [[Erunak Stonespeaker|Erunak]] at [[Shallow's End]].
*[[Soggy Note]] (provided)

==Description==
The note in this bottle is soaked through, but still legible.

In it, the author claims to have escaped from some sort of undersea naga prison.

He is clearly in fear for his life, and you can't help but wonder if it might be one of your recently abducted shipmates.

At a loss as to how to locate the escapee, you determine to share the find with Erunak.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|90}}
*9,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
If he still lives, I may be able to locate this poor soul.

==Notes==
This quest is offered by the broken bottle near the waterline after completing [[Ophidophobia]] from [[Adarrah]] in the [[Smuggler's Scar]].

==Progression==
{{Holding Pens}}
