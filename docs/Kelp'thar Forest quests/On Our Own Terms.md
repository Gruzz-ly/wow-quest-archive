== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Taylor||Captain Taylor}} in the ''[[Briny Cutter]]''.

== Description ==
We're as ready as we'll ever be. No sense waiting around for the naga to find us.

I'll address the men, then we'll meet the enemy on our own terms and let fate decide the outcome.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Completion ==
No time to address the troops now.

Just as well. They know what must be done.
