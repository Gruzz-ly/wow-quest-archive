== Objectives ==
You must destroy 6 sets of Naga Tridents.
*Naga Weapons Destroyed x6

== Description ==
Naga weapons...

As you cast your vision on the naga [[Holding Pens]], you see dozens of similar stacks of tridents positioned strategically.

Destroying their weapons could only hamper whatever wicked designs they are carrying out in this region...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Have you destroyed the naga arsenal?

== Completion ==
You're confident that your assault on the naga armaments has made an impact on their effectiveness.

== Notes ==
After leaving the [[Deepmist Grotto]] on the post-[[Wake of Destruction]] quests, players will run across a set of Naga Tridents at {{co|60.4|69.8|Kelp'thar Forest}} near the entrance to the [[Holding Pens]]. Like everything else in the hub, if tridents are hard to come by, look up.

==Progression==
{{Holding Pens}}
