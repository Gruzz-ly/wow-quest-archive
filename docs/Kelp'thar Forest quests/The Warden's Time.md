{{questportrait|Erunak Stonespeaker.jpg|Erunak Stonespeaker|Erunak's image penetrates your mind.}}
{{NPC||Erunak Stonespeaker}} wants you to slay {{NPC||Warden Azjakir}} at the [[Holding Pens]].
* [[Warden Azjakir|Zin'jatar Warden]] Slain

== Description ==
<Erunak's image penetrates your mind.>

You have done well, <name>, but more remains to be done.

Before moving on from this place, let us be sure that we leave it in disarray.

Find the one who leads these naga and repay him for his misdeeds.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Progress ==
Is it done, <name>?

== Completion ==
It is good that this operation has been undone.

Soon, I must move on...

== Notes ==
After remotely completing Rendel's quest, [[Come Hell or High Water]] in the Holding Pens, Erunak speaks telepathically, offering this quest. 

Azjakir can be found at {{co|60|81|Kelp'thar Forest}} at the southeastern end of the Holding Pens up on a high bluff close to the water's surface.

This concludes the Kelp'thar Forest portion of Vashj'ir. Players are sent across the [[Lightless Reaches]] in [[Across the Great Divide]] to [[Shimmering Expanse]] next.
