== Objectives ==
Take the Alliance S.E.A.L. Equipment to {{NPC||Legionnaire Nazgrim}} at ''[[The Immortal Coil]]''.
*[[Alliance S.E.A.L. Equipment]] (provided)

== Description ==
This helm and its associated components are marked with the seal of [[Stormwind]]. It was no doubt cast off from an [[Alliance]] ship that suffered a similar fate to yours.

Looking closer, this seems far too intricate and sturdy to be everyday diving equipment. Perhaps Nazgrim can make some sense of this...

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

== Completion ==
Blood and Thunder!

This changes everything, <class>!

== Notes ==
The helm is northwest of the ''[[Immortal Coil]]'' inside a shattered crate near other Horde crates for players on the quest [[Girding Our Loins]].

The quest-name is supposedly a reference to the similarly named location in the Lord of the Rings-universe.

==Progression==
{{Honor's Tomb}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
