==Objectives==
Kill 4 Brinescale Serpents at [[Gorrok's Lament]].
*[[Brinescale Serpent]] slain x4

==Description==
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's snakes. Any kind of snakes - doesn't matter.

While I was out searching for salvage, I saw a nest of [[sea serpent]]s surrounding the nearby wreckage.

I simply can't relax knowing that those awful creatures could slither up in here at any moment.

Please, <class>! Do something about them!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|80}}
* 12,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You take care of those snakes for me, <class>?

==Completion==
Well that's a load off my mind.

Thank you again, <class>.

==Notes and trivia==
*After stealing the [[Keg of Gunpowder]] during [[Can't Start a Fire Without a Spark]], Adarrah will offer this quest.
*Pick up [[Nerve Tonic]] from {{NPC||Mack Fearsen}} before heading out and make sure to start [[The Horde's Hoard]] from the [[Tattered Treasure Map]] as well. Then head to ''Gorrok's Lament'', just to the east.
*[[wikipedia:Ophidiophobia|Ophidiophobia]] is an abnormal fear of snakes - appropriate for this particular quest giver.
