==Objectives==
[[Adarrah]] wants you to recover 6 Adarrah's Keepsakes.
*[[Adarrah's Keepsake]] (6)

==Description==
Let's just get it out in the open. I'm no stranger to love, <name>.

Over the years, if there's one thing I've learned, it's that love's tangible treasures last longer than the flames of passion.

I've managed to collect my fair share of these gifts - gemstones, rings, necklaces, and the like, and I carry them with me wherever I go.

At least I used to...

When I was swept from the ship, my valuables were scattered across the sea. Help me recover them and I promise to make it worth your while.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Hippolyte's Glittering Necklace|Signet of Galathea|Petrified Spider Crab}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|7|80}}
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Well, <race>?

Were you able to recover my valuables?

==Completion==
Oh, you've found them! I was sure they were lost forever...

Here you are, <name>. I hope this is ample payment.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Taste For Tail]] from Adarrah and [[Can't Start a Fire Without a Spark]] from Samir before heading back out. The jewel boxes are all over the sea floor of the general area.
