==Objectives==
Collect 5 of Gnaws' teeth from the [[Skeletal Reef]].
*[[Gnaws' Tooth]] (5)

==Description==
That's one tough shark!

You determine that it's in everyone's best interest to try and distract [[Budd Nedreck|Budd]] and hope his attention never returns to [[Gnaws]] and this Skeletal Reef.

Perhaps the teeth of the beast will prove captivating enough...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Whatcha got there, pal?

==Completion==
What?!

Gnaws ain't dead?!

This kinda takes the quick outta my get rich quick scheme...

Them giant shark teeth are nice and all, but we can't stop 'til that shiney is ours!
