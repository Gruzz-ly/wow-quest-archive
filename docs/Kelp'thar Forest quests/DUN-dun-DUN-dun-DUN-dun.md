==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Gnaws.jpg|Gnaws|It's a little bit safer to go back in these waters, but not much...}}
Use Budd's Chain on the [[Rusty Harpoon Gun]] in [[The Skeletal Reef]]. Fire the Harpoon when Gnaws is in position over the gun.
*Gnaws Slain
*[[Budd's Chain]] (provided)

==Description==
If ol' Gnaws had heels he'd be on 'em right now.

Fortunately for you, I think like a shark.

Gnaws is mad as all get out and we're gunna use that to our advantage.

Here, I found this chain while out treasure-huntin'. Use it to tie off to that harpoon gun.

When Gnaws sees ya he'll be consumed with rage - that's when we strike!

You try to finish him off and I'll sneak in there and grab the shiney.

Hurry, <class>, before he grows them teeth back!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
This really ain't as bad as it looks...

==Notes==
Swim back to the Rusty Harpoon Gun in the middle of the reef at {{coords|58.3|48.8|Kelp'thar Forest}} and use the chain. Gnaws will snag the fresh bait and circle the area once. Once Gnaws is over the harpoon gun, pull the trigger to kill him! Gnaws will swim to [[Gnaws' Boneyard]] and die, completing the quest. Swim back to a... rather changed Budd at the harpoon gun.

His gossip text:
:It ain't all bad...
:I still got my breathin' hat!

==Trivia==
This quest is another reference to the theme song from ''Jaws''.
