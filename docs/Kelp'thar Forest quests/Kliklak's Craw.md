==Objectives==
Obtain the Corroded Key from [[Kliklak]] to unlock the [[Half-buried Footlocker]] in the [[Kelp'thar Forest]].
*[[Corroded Key]]

==Description==
You are pleasantly surprised to find that after being mangled and masticated by a [[Sabreclaw Skitterer|sea crab]], this map is still quite legible.

It clearly indicates that a footlocker was buried in the Kelp'thar Forest behind a [[Shallow's End|gigantic mollusk]].

A well-drawn sketch on the back of the map that the owner, along with his key, was eaten by an overgrown crustacean named Kliklak.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|15|60}}
*12,300 [[XP]]
*[[Barnacle-Coated Greataxe]]

==Progress==
The footlocker's keyhole is encrusted with barnacles, but may still be operable.

==Completion==
The satisfying sound of a chest unlocking is followed by the sight of once-hidden treasure.

==Notes==
The treasure map drops from [[Sabreclaw Skitterer]]s in the central part of [[Kelp'thar Forest]], probably during [[Ophidophobia]].

[[Kliklak]] is a giant red [[lobstrok]] swimming in the kelp forest proper of [[Kelp'thar Forest]] between [[Shallow's End]] and [[Smuggler's Hole]]. The Half-buried Lockbox is at Shallow's End behind the small shell between Erunak and Rendel.
