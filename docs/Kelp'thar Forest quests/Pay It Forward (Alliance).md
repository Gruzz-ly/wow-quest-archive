==Objectives==
Use the Enchanted Conch Shell to rescue 6 Drowning Soldiers.
*[[Drowning Soldier|Soldiers]] Rescued x6
*[[Enchanted Conch]] (provided)

==Description==
You are now able to move about this realm more freely and without fear of drowning.

This is where our work begins.

First, you have many allies nearby who are drowning as we speak. As I saved you, you must save them.

I have enchanted the shell you brought me. Use it to rescue your friends.

Hurry now!

==Progress==
Were you able to rescue the soldiers, <race>?

We will perish without their help...

==Completion==
While you were away, I was able to revive some of the fallen soldiers.

We'll need every hand if we are to survive here.

==Notes==
The conch has a surprisingly long range. Once bubbled, they will float their way back to the ship. [[Taylor|Captain Taylor]] is one of the sailors players have saved.
