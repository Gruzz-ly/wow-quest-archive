==Objectives==
Use the Orb of Suggestion to subdue a [[Famished Great Shark]], then use it to destroy 25 Zin'jatar at the [[Holding Pens]].
*[[Zin'jatar Guardian]]s Eaten Alive (10)
*[[Orb of Suggestion]] (provided)

==Description==
Our time here draws to a close. I must somehow follow the trail of these [[naga]] captives if we are to discover their purposes in this region.

But before I move on, I would see the destruction of this operation!

Nevermind their numbers, I have a plan that has the potential to even the odds.

Outside this cave, famished great sharks, displaced by these naga, seek food.

In their weakened state, they will be susceptible to suggestion. Use this orb to subdue them, then direct them against our enemy.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
With the naga numbers dramatically lessened, we shall be able to finish our destruction of this stronghold.

==Completion==
It is as it should be.

Now the way is clear to deal these naga a crippling blow.

==Notes==
Swim outside of the cave and use the item on a sea shark. No need to fight one to half health or less.
:{{text|bossemote|Ride into the Holding Pens and DEVOUR naga!}}

Once on the shark, players have access to two abilities:
#{{abilities|Eat Naga|range=15|Causes the Dominated Great Shark to ravenously devour a nearby Zin'jatar Guardian in the Holding Pens|notes=Instant}}
#
#{{abilities|Return to Safety|Directs the Dominated Great Shark to bring you to the entrance to the Deepmist Grotto.}}

The eat command will attack the closest naga in range, irrespective of target. Like sharks in the real world, the shark cannot stop moving, but base speed is fairly slow. After tearing apart 25 naga, use the Return ability to quickly get back to the entrance of the grotto and dismount the shark.

After completing the quest, each of the other NPCs in the grotto offers a quest. So do some of the naga tridents players will run in to back in the Pens... Rendel's quest, [[Come Hell or High Water]] is the only required quest before Erunak will chime in with [[The Warden's Time]] remotely.
