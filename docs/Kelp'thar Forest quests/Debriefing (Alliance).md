==Objectives==
Speak to Private Pollard and learn about his ordeal.
*[[Private Pollard]] Debriefed

==Description==
This soldier was near death, but I fear we do not have the time to await his full recovery. He has information we desperately need to know.

Be patient with him, but keep him talking until we've learned all that we can.

With luck we might discover just what we're up against...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*9,250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
That's it <race>.

That's all I know...

==Completion==
Well, it's not encouraging, but it's something...

==Notes==
* I don't know why, but those monsters are going out of their way to keep our men alive...
* Our soldiers... they're all captives now.
* Many of us tried to escape the naga.
: I am the only one who succeeded...

{{gossip|''Who are you, friend?''}}

:Private Reginald Pollard, 13th brigade, Storwmwind infantry... <sir/ma'am>.

{{gossip|''How did you get down here?''}}

:We had them in our sights... the Horde ships... then out of nowhere, tentacles reached up and seized our ship... broke it right in two!

:The survivors... we were captured by naga as soon as we hit the water.

:That was nearly a week ago.

{{gossip|''What can you tell me about your captors?''}}

:Strange... never thought the naga would go out of their way to keep us alive.

:They create these pearly bubbles... one per man... made it so we could breathe.

:Every day they send a bunch of prisoners off... somewhere.

:Never see them again....

{{gossip|''How did you escape, Pollard?''}}

:Another soldier somehow got free and broke a bunch of our pearls... freed us.

:Some swam up toward the surface... some saw this cave and swam for it.

:I'm the only one that made it....

{{gossip|''Did you see [[Taylor|Captain Taylor]] and his men?''}}

:No telling...

:They brought new soldiers in every day. Horde and Alliance, both.

:Some would get hauled away the same day... others, like me, kept there for a week... maybe more.

{{gossip|''Are there any weaknesses we can exploit? Any holes in the naga defenses?''}}

:Don't even try, <race>.

:Get out of here while you can...

:There are too many... certain death...
