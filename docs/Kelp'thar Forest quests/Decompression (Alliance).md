==Objectives==
Use Moanah's Breathstone on 10 Imprisoned Soldiers in the [[Holding Pens]].
*[[Imprisoned Soldier]]s Released x10
*[[Breathstone]] (provided)

==Description==
I simply cannot bear the thought of so many others like this soldier imprisoned, surrounded by naga.

Something must be done to rescue them!

Try this, <name>. Use it on the prison cells to make them buoyant.

If we can get them to the surface, at least they stand a chance at being rescued.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Cone-Snail Cinch|Pteropod Robes|Breathstone-Infused Longbow}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}

==Progress==
Were you able to rescue some of the imprisoned soldiers, <name>?

==Completion==
Let us hope for the safety of those released prisoners.

In return for your noble efforts, please accept this gift.

==Notes==
Pick up [[What? What? In My Gut...?]] and [[Come Hell or High Water]] before heading out. Take note of the [[Naga Tridents]] at {{co|60.4|69.8|Kelp'thar Forest}} between the grotto and the clutch proper. They start [[How Disarming]].

The stone has a large range. Don't forget to look up if having issues finding prisoners.

Before heading back to the grotto to turn in, complete [[Come Hell or High Water]] automatically by killing the 12 naga and pick up Erunak's quest [[The Warden's Time]]. Kill [[Warden Azjakir]], then head back to the grotto.
