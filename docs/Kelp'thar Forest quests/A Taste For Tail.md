==Objectives==
[[Adarrah]] wants you to bring her 4 Clacksnap Tails.
*[[Clacksnap Tail]] (4)

==Description==
It could be days before we're ready to make our way to the surface, and to be honest, I'm already beginning to get hungry.

I hate to be picky, but when it comes to seafood, I'm afraid there are very few things I can stomach.

If you come across any lobster types, I would happily pay you what coin I have with me for their tails.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|80}}
*12,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Oh, please tell me you were able to find me some food, <class>.

==Completion==
Oh, my!

That's some of the biggest, juiciest tail I've ever seen!

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Girl's Best Friend]] from Adarrah and [[Can't Start a Fire Without a Spark]] from Samir before heading out. [[Clacksnap Pincer]]s are found on the seafloor. While out and about, keep an eye out for a [[Sunken Crate]] on the seafloor just to the southwest of Samir and Mack's former location. It offers yet another quest, [[Crate of Crab Meat]].
