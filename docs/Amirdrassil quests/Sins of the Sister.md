'''Sins of the Sister''' concludes the storyline of the same name during the [[Dark Heart campaign]].

==Objectives==
Speak with Malfurion Stormrage about [[Koroleth]]'s remains.
*Speak with [[Malfurion Stormrage|Malfurion]]
*Listen to Malfurion's decision

==Description==
[[Rashan Stillbrook|This druid]] is trying to convince Malfurion not to let me bury my sister here with the rest of my family. He won't even let me get a word in.

<[[Kelestra]] tightly clutches the straps of her backpack holding her sister's remains.>

I know I have asked a lot of you already. Could you talk to them? Perhaps they might listen to you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|56|18}}
*[[Satchel of Stormborn Seeds]]
*15x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
<Malfurion is deep in thought.>

==Completion==
That was no easy decision to make. But I believe it was the correct one.

Thank you for assisting Kelestra in this matter. Despite the circumstances, let us hope that finding her sister may give her some measure of closure.

==Notes==
Speak with Malfurion Stormrage:

{{Dialogue|This is a difficult situation.

I did not realize that Kelestra's sister was Koroleth, a known [[Primalists|Primalist]] and traitor.

Koroleth was an enemy, and yet there is evidence to suggest she might have switched sides later in the war, as many others did.

But does that possibility exonerate her sins?

<Malfurion furrows his brow in thought.>

{{Gossip|quest=|<Try to persuade Malfurion that Koroleth should be allowed to rest within the barrow den.>}}<br>
{{Gossip|quest=|<Try to persuade Malfurion that Koroleth was a traitor and does not deserve to rest here.>}}<br>
{{Gossip|quest=|<Don't try to persuade Malfurion either way and let him make his own decision.>}}
}}

Choosing an option pops up a choice popup:
:This will determine where Koroleth's remains are laid to rest. Are you sure you wish to select this option?
:Accept/Cancel

If players choose the first or third option:
:{{Text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Kelestra, your sister Koroleth fought for the Primalists, and her actions caused pain and sorrow for us and our allies.}}
:{{Text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|However, she did not escape the consequences of those actions. She paid for them with her life.}}
:{{Text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Koroleth could not find peace in life. But perhaps under the boughs of a new world tree, she may find some in eternal rest.}}
:{{Text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Kelestra, you may bury your sister with the rest of your family.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|Thank you. Both of you. You have given me the peace I thought would never come.}}
:{{Text|say|Rashan Stillbrook|Hmph. My brother died fighting Koroleth. Where is his peace? Where is his justice?!}}
:''Rashan walks away. Kelestra heads inside the den.''
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|<Name>, when you have a moment, please come see me at my family's resting place.}}

If players choose the second option:
:{{Text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Kelestra, your sister Koroleth fought for the Primalists, and her actions caused pain and sorrow for us and our allies.}}
:{{Text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|I cannot in good conscience allow her to be buried here, on ground that we have shed so much blood to protect.}}
:{{Text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|It would be a disservice to all those who fought and died against the Primalists to stop their machinations.}}
:{{Text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Kelestra, I am sorry, but you must lay your sister to rest elsewhere.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|My heart aches that my family will never be united again.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|<Name>, when you are done with these people, come find me on the beach where you found my sister.}}
:''Kelestra turns and leaves crying.''
:{{Text|say|Rashan Stillbrook|You have done the right thing, Archdruid. It was not pleasant, it was not easy, but it was right.}}
:''Rashan heads back to the barrow den.''

After completing the quest, if Koroleth was allowed to be buried in the barrow den, head inside to {{co|73.0|79.5|Amirdrassil}} and speak with Kelestra for new gossip:
{{Dialogue|Thank you <name>, for all that you have done for me.

I do not dispute what Koroleth did or the harm that she caused. But I never knew Koroleth the primalist.

I knew Koroleth the druid, who dedicated her life to the balance and harmony of nature.

I knew Koroleth the [[Night elf|kaldorei]], who would have given her life to protect [[Teldrassil]] and its people.

I knew Koroleth, my sister, who would take me to the docks of [[Rut'theran Village]] as a child to watch the ships sail by, and on the way home, buy a basket of Tundra Berries for me to munch on.

That is the Koroleth I will remember.}}

If Koroleth was ''not'' allowed to be buried in the barrow den, head back to the northern tip of the Ancient Coast at {{Co|89.9|21.0|Amirdrassil}} and approach Kelestra:
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|Over here, <name>. If I couldn't bury my sister beneath [[Amirdrassil]], I could at least lay her to rest beneath this tree.}}

Speak with Kelestra for new gossip:
{{Dialogue|I don't know what you said to Malfurion, but thank you for trying <name>.

<Kelestra wipes away tears.>

Since my sister is unwanted at Amirdrassil, I decided to lay her to rest here, where you found her.

I know that my sister has wronged our people... but she's gone. Must they punish her for eternity? Can they not let go of their anger? Their hatred?

<Kelestra clenches her fists so tightly, they begin to tremble.>}}
