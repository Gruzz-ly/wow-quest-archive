==Objectives==
Meet [[Kelestra]] outside the [[Barrows of Reverie|barrow den]] at the [[Fields of Reverie]].

==Description==
All that is left to do is to gather [[Koroleth|my sister]]'s remains and bring them to the barrow den.

Please meet me there, <name>. I could use a friend.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*5x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
<Kelestra is on the verge of tears.>

They refuse to let me in. After all we have done. They deny my sister peace!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|Sister... you will be reunited with our family soon.}}

Head back to the entrance of the barrow den. [[Rashan Stillbrook]] and [[Malfurion Stormrage]] stand there.
:{{Text|say|Rashan Stillbrook|You will not desecrate this den with that traitor's filth!}}
:{{Text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Let's keep calm now.}}

Both have gossip:
{{dialogue|title=Rashan|
Koroleth was a Primalist and a traitor! To bury her here at Amirdrassil would spit in the face of all those who lost their lives defending against her madness.

We all felt the pain of Teldrassil and still bear the scars today on our hearts. That does not excuse Koroleth's actions or her betrayal.

She made her choices and she must accept the consequences.}}

{{dialogue|title=Malfurion|
This is a difficult situation.

I did not realize that Kelestra's sister was Koroleth, a known Primalist and traitor.

Koroleth was an enemy, and yet there is evidence to suggest she might have switched sides later in the war, as many others did.

But does that possibility exonerate her sins?

<Malfurion furrows his brow in thought.>}}
