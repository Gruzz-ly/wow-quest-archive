==Description==
After speaking with [[Malathra Nighthelm|the warden]], I learned the [[Battle of the Barrier]] where my sister fell took place east of here, on the shores of the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]].

I understand her body was washed out to sea and never recovered.

It's possible the tide brought her remains back to shore at some point. Will you help me look for her?

Each member of my family has a necklace with this distinct design. It will identify Koroleth's body.

I would like to lay her to rest with the family she loved.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|28|9}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Is this the necklace you found?

==Completion==
Oh Koroleth...

<Kelestra looks at the remains and weeps softly.>

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|We can cover more ground if we split up. If you find her, signal me.}}
:''Kelestra mounts up her hippogryph and flies eastward.''

Head to the [[Ancient Bough]] coast and find the first set of [[Unidentified Remains]]:
{{dialogue|<These bones have been bleached by the sun for some time.>

{{Gossip|quest=|<Investigate the remains.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|
<These bones clearly belong to a troll, not a night elf.>}}}}

Three [[Stormbound Vestige]] air elementals appear and attack. Fend them off, then head northward to find the second set of Unidentified Remains:
{{dialogue|<These remains bear the tattered clothing of a Primalist.>

{{Gossip|quest=|<Investigate the remains.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|
<The deceased was much shorter in stature than a night elf, likely a vulpera, goblin, or gnome.>}}}}

A [[Stormbound Revenant]] appears and attacks. Fight it off as well, then locate the third set further northeast:
{{dialogue|<There are few identifying marks left on these bones, but something glinting catches your eye.>

{{Gossip|quest=|<Investigate the remains.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|
<You find a necklace half-buried in the sand. It has the same distinct markings as Kelestra's necklace.>}}}}

The adventurer picks up [[Koroleth's Necklace]]. This pops up the Signal Kelestra extra action button, so use it to have Kelestra come:
:{{Text|yell|Kelestra|Did you find her?}}
:''Kelestra lands and kneels by the skeleton remains.''

==Progression==
{{Kelestra}}
