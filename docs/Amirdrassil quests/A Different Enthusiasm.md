==Objectives==
Reveal 6 [[Spriggan Prankster]]s in [[Bel'ameth]].
* Spriggans revealed (6)

==Description==
I noticed the festivities have drawn the attention of a few [[spriggan]]s from [[Ardenweald]]. They are curious creatures with... interesting tastes.

Their pranks have been more than disruptive. Please root them out so the celebration may continue in peace.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Have you discovered all of them? I have already heard a middling rumor that I suspect they spun up.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I appreciate their liveliness, but they are not on our guest list tonight.

==Notes==
Look for lit-up units all over the area, including [[Dizzying Reveler]]s, [[Suspicious Tree]]s, [[Noxious Decoration]]s or [[Talking Fish]], interact with them, then deplete their health and they will run away.

[[Disoriented Reveler]]s and [[Irritated Reveler]] react when the spriggans are revealed.

When revealing a spriggan near Revelers

*{{Text|say|Disoriented Reveler|I will never understand fashion.}}
*{{Text|say|Disoriented Reveler|So that's why they dressed like that. You haven't fooled me, spriggan!}}
*{{Text|say|Disoriented Reveler|Those shoes with that outfit... criminal!}}
