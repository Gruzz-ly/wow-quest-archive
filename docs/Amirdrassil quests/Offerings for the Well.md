==Description==
[[Amirdrassil]] has been ushered into [[Azeroth|this world]] by the denizens of [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]]. Now we must ensure its roots are bathed in the waters of [[Elune]] by creating a new [[moonwell]].

So many of my people have brought us to this moment. Each should have a part in this dedication. 

Go, speak to the kaldorei gathered here, and see if they have offerings for the ceremony.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 10x [[Emerald Dewdrop]]

==Progress==
Have you collected all the offerings for the ceremony?

==Completion==
Every kaldorei understands the grief and elation of a moment such as this. The pain we have endured and the hope we have for the future.

These offerings are profound and appreciated.

==Notes==
Speak with the listed characters:

{{Dialogue|title=Rensar Greathoof|
Our people have suffered much, yet they have shown courage in the face of adversity, time and again. Please, take this soil from the [[Dreamgrove]]. It is a reminder of the courage displayed when we fought back the [[Emerald Dream|Nightmare]] from the Dream, not so long ago. We have never faltered, and never will.

May Amirdrassil taste of that courage, and grow stronger still.

{{gossip|quest=|Thank you for your offering.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Rensar Greathoof|If we can have courage to face the Nightmare, we can have courage to face our future.}}
:The ''[[Soil of the Dreamgrove]] is obtained.''

{{Dialogue|title=Cerellean Whiteclaw|
My offering is the pendant of my beloved, [[Anaya Dawnrunner]]. I have lost many close to me over my lifetime, but none so painful as my greatest love.

I cannot be reunited with her here, but perhaps her spirit can live on. A beacon of love, for the kaldorei.

{{gossip|quest=|Thank you for your offering.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Cerellean Whiteclaw|A love to encompass all kaldorei.}}
:''[[Anaya's Pendant#Offerings for the Well]] is obtained.''

{{Dialogue|title=Delaryn Summermoon|
I have an offering, if it will be accepted.

This [[druid]] talisman once belonged to my beloved [[Ferryn]]. Some part of me knew that he was gone, of course. But as long as I carried his talisman, I carried the hope that we would be reunited.

Hope gives us strength even in our darkest hours. May Amirdrassil continue to inspire us all.

{{gossip|quest=|Thank you for your offering.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Delaryn Summermoon|May our hope strengthen us.}}
:''The [[Talisman of Hope]] is obtained.''

{{Dialogue|title=Moon Priestess Lasara|
My offering is a tabard from [[Darnassus]]. A symbol of our people's devotion and our strength. It is one of the few things I was able to save from our home.

I have many fond memories of passing tabards like this to kaldorei [[Adventurer|young and old]] alike, and of seeing its colors draped proudly over our devoted allies as well.

These memories should live on here, with this moonwell.

{{gossip|quest=|Thank you for your offering.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Moon Priestess Lasara|Our memories and our devotion shall stand firm.}}
:''[[Singed Darnassian Tabard]] is obtained.''
