'''An Uncommon Request''' starts the Sins of the Sister chapter of the [[Dark Heart campaign]] added in [[patch 10.2.7]]. [[Malfurion Stormrage]] starts it at the [[Terrace of the Moon]] of [[Bel'ameth]] on the open-world version of [[Amirdrassil]]. The final quest reward is the [[Satchel of Stormborn Seeds]] toy.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Kelestra]] in the [[Barrows of Reverie]].

==Description==
<Name>, welcome to Bel'ameth. I wonder -- do you have time for a small favor?

Earlier today, a young [[kaldorei]] named Kelestra came to see me. She sought permission to bury her family in a [[barrow den]]. An uncommon request, but I gave her my blessing and directed her to the Barrows of Reverie.

She looked... melancholy. After she left, it struck me that she might be the last of her family still alive. If you have the time, could you check on her?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*5x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
<Kelestra is so preoccupied with her own thoughts, it takes her a few moments to notice you.>

Oh hello, I didn't see you there. Would you... do you have a moment?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Malfurion Stormrage|Thank you <name>. No one should be left alone during times of grief.}}

Head to the entrance of the Barrows of Reverie to catch [[Kelestra]] sitting on the steps:
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|I don't know if I can do this by myself.}}

==Progression==
{{Kelestra}}

==PTR version==
;Completion
:<Kelestra seems almost paralyzed with emotion until she notices you.>
:Oh hello, I didn't notice you there. Would you... do you have a moment?
