'''Andu-falah-dor''' ([[Darnassian]] for "Let balance be restored") concludes the "New Beginnings" chapter of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]].

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Merithra]] in [[Bel'ameth]].
*Speak with Merithra to leave the party
*Speak with Merithra at the [[moonwell]]
*Return to [[Alexstrasza]] in [[Bel'ameth]].

==Description==
[[Ysera|My mother]] asked for us all to meet her by the moonwell.

It has been long enough. We should not keep her waiting.

Speak with me there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* [[Gift of Amirdrassil]]
* [[Plump Dreamseed]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
As [[Amirdrassil]] blooms into [[Azeroth]] beyond the [[Emerald Dream|Dream]], my sister takes on the mantle of a new [[Dragon Aspects|Aspect]].

<Alexstrasza glances at where the portal was and smiles.>

And you, <name>, have drawn all these events to a happy conclusion.

==Notes==
Speak with Merithra again:
{{Dialogue|Are you ready to leave the celebration? Our gathered friends will be departing soon, so be sure to say farewell now before we go.

{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready to leave the party.}}
}}
:''The scene fades to black for a moment and the player leaves the party phase.''

On the way down the slope to the moonwell are [[Nozdormu]] and [[Ebyssian]], who have nothing to say, then [[Kalecgos]] and [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Jaina Proudmoore]], who do:

{{Dialogue|title=Lady Jaina Proudmoore|
You know, we never had a celebration [[Battle for Mount Hyjal|after Hyjal]]. Back then, we had as much to lament as we did to celebrate. Our victory came at such a great cost...

We were all just... weary. What little energy we had left was spent tending to our wounded, and moving to our respective homes.

I am glad that this time, we could afford to celebrate.

{{gossip|Stay a while and listen.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Jaina!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Kalec! I'm sorry I haven't reached out sooner.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Not to worry. You've been more than a little busy.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Reuniting [[Proudmoore|your family]] and serving [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]] as [[Lord Admiral]].}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|What about you? You have your Aspectral powers again!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|And you brought [[Blue dragonflight|the blues]] home, Kalec. I know how much that meant to you.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I think... we both needed to make a journey.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Just not together.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|And that's all right.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|It is.  Do you have some time? I'd like you to meet [[Iskaara Tuskarr|some friends]] of mine.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|But I must warn you, they'll probably insist that you try their soup. And they like to use... [[eel]] guts.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I'm Kul Tiran, remember? I grew up on eel liver soup. It sounds wonderful!}}

Further downhill are [[Merithra|Merithra of the Dream]] and [[Tyrande Whisperwind]]. Speak with Merithra:

{{Dialogue|
<Merithra takes a deep breath and sets her shoulders.>

Are you ready, Champion?

{{gossip|quest=|I am ready.}}
}}

An [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|j2aeKxd1Vg0}}
:''Ysera and Alexstrasza hug each other.''
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|I am so grateful we had this time together.}}
:''They turn to look at the adventurer, Merithra, and Tyrande walking up.''
:{{text|say|Ysera|My beloved friends. With the aid of those gathered here, Amirdrassil blossoms all around us.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|Do you remember when you first held its [[The Sisters' Tear|seed]] in your arms, Tyrande?}}
:{{text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Of course. I cradled it as I would a child and promised the souls within to honor their sacrifice.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|And I swore to you I would do everything in my power to protect it. We have both kept our vows.}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|It is time I return to [[Ardenweald]], to restore the balance and repay a debt to an [[Malfurion Stormrage|old friend]].}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|Mother... I thought you came back to ensure that I would--}}
:{{text|say|Ysera|My precious child... You are strong, compassionate, and wise. And you have become the leader I knew you would. You did not need me to guide you.}}
:{{text|say|Merithra|Mother, I will always need you.}}
:''They hug.''
:{{text|say|Ysera|I shall not be far.}}
:''They let go. Ysera holds Merithra's face in her hand for a moment.''
:{{text|say|Ysera|I am so, so proud of you, my heart.}}
:''Ysera steps away.''
:{{text|say|Ysera|Remember--all time is borrowed. And in this, there is beauty.}}
:''As Ysera looks at Alexstrasza, Tyrande, and Merithra in turn, a Night Fae-tinged portal opens up behind her.''
:{{text|say|Ysera|All is well.}}
:''Ysera turns and walks through the portal. As it closes behind her, Tyrande puts a hand on Merithra's shoulder.''

On complete:
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza|Amirdrassil is here and balance takes wing once more. Much of this is due to your tenacity and courage. Thank you for your aid, my friend.}}

This concludes the "New Beginnings" chapter of the [[Guardians of the Dream campaign]], and thus awards the [[Defenders of the Dream (achievement)]] achievement.

Up the hill, [[Watcher Koranos]] and [[Tyr]] are observing:

{{Dialogue|title=Watcher Koranos|Tyr created myself and [[Titan watcher|my brethren]] to watch over [[Dragon Isles|these Isles]]. It was my duty to reactivate the [[Beacon of Tyrhold]].

When the opportunity to reawaken Tyr arose, I thought it my duty as well.

Yet... I do not like to see him this way. Uncertain. Searching.

Perhaps I am a watcher no longer. Perhaps now, I may serve as guide.

{{gossip|Stay a while and listen.}}
}}
:{{text|say|Tyr|The world I have returned to bears little resemblance to the one I left, Koranos.}}
:{{text|say|Tyr|[[Empire]]s have risen and fallen. The [[Old God]]s are no more. The Dragon Isles have slumbered and awakened.}}
:{{text|say|Tyr|Old friends have died, some of them ignobly. And the ones who remain do not seem to have need of me.}}
:{{text|say|Tyr|Even the Aspects regained their powers without my aid... or the [[titan]]s' intervention.}}
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|Our circumstances are similar, Keeper Tyr. We were made to serve. I too have fulfilled my purpose.}}
:{{text|say|Watcher Koranos|But this new world is vast and wondrous. Perhaps it will be enough for us to just observe and help safeguard it?}}
:{{text|say|Tyr|Hmm. I have much to ponder.}}

The cutscene is bugged and Merithra's model is replaced by a placeholder cube.
