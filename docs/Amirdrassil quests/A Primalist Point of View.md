==Objectives==
Speak to the reformed [[Primalists]] about [[Koroleth]].
*Speak to [[Ereria Galesinger]]
*Speak to [[Idoral Starstrike]]
*Speak to [[Kotori Lightningstride]]
*Speak to [[Shalrinar Shimmersong]]

==Description==
[[Malathra Nighthelm|Warden Malathra]] has granted us permission to speak with the Primalists. They might have switched sides, but the [[warden]]s are keeping a close eye on them.

<[[Kelestra]] begins to look distressed.>

I'm going to talk to the Warden more. Could you handle the Primalists? All of this about Koroleth is just happening so suddenly. I feel we should gather as much information as we can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|14|4|50}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
I want to talk to them, but I don't even know where to begin.

==Completion==
What were you able to find out?

<Kelestra listens as you explain what you learned.>

I can understand why my sister would want nothing more than the [[Horde]] destroyed. I and many others felt the same way for a time. And Koroleth always had a single-minded focus in getting what she wanted.

But I also believe that had she known about [[Amirdrassil]], she would have defected immediately.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Malathra Nighthelm|The Primalists can be found scattered about, tending to the flora with their storm powers.}}

The four individuals are nearby:

{{dialogue|title=Ereria Galesinger|How can I help you?

{{Gossip|quest=|<Tell me what you know about Koroleth.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Koroleth was one of the most powerful storm [[shaman]] amongst the Primalists. She leveraged her training as a [[Druids of the Talon|Druid of the Talon]] to master the elements more quickly and more fully than others.

It was also why she was chosen to lead the initial assault on the [[Emerald Dream]]. As a former [[druid]], she knew more about the Dream and its weaknesses than anyone else.}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Idoral Starstrike|Yes <race>, what is it?

{{Gossip|quest=|<Tell me what you know about Koroleth.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|
Koroleth was terrifying. The [[Burning of Teldrassil]] scarred her face and scorched her hair off. I heard she lost her entire family there.

She was singularly consumed with anything that would bring an end to the Horde. She let nothing get in her way.}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Kotori Lightningstride|I'm just trying to repair the damage my actions have caused. What do you want?

{{Gossip|quest=|<Tell me what you know about Koroleth.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I don't know much about her. I steered clear of Koroleth as much as possible. She hated the Horde and was exceptionally hard on any Horde races within the Primalist ranks.

I heard she joined the Primalists after the [[Alliance]] signed the armistice. She had sworn vengeance on the Horde for [[Teldrassil]], and if the Alliance would not destroy the Horde, then she would find someone else who would.

No matter the cost.}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Shalrinar Shimmersong|If I had only known earlier what Fyrakk was planning...

{{Gossip|quest=|<Tell me what you know about Koroleth.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|
I switched sides after I learned our true target in the Dream was a new [[world tree]]. I don't know for sure if Koroleth knew the truth, but I believe it was kept from her.

I cannot imagine she would willingly be part of an assault on Amirdrassil. If she had survived, she might even be standing with us here today.}}}}
