==Description==
I have carried this weight long enough. It has finally come time to put my family to rest. Even if I never found my sister...

<Kelestra wipes away tears and takes a deep breath.>

I must gather barrowstones to place at their final resting place. But I simply cannot carry that many stones.

Maybe I ask too much of a stranger, but would you assist me? I know having someone beside me will make this more endurable.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|14|4|50}}
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
<Kelestra looks distraught, and her hands are shaking.>

I can not parse my feelings. My sister is alive, but a traitor.

And what did he mean she deserved her fate?

Please [[Koroleth]], let this finally be our time to reunite.

==Completion==
<Kelestra takes a deep breath and tries to calm herself.>

Koroleth... what have you done? Why? I must find out why!

==Notes==
Speak with Kelestra:
{{Dialogue|
I have never been inside a [[barrow den]] before. My sister told me that [[druid]]s do not just sleep and congregate in dens. They also can be laid to rest here. This honor is also extended to the druid's immediate family. 

My sister loved the idea. I hope I can give her, and my family, the rest that they deserve.

I am ready when you are.

:''Kelestra starts walking inside.''

As Kelestra walks, she stops by Barrostones. Loot them, then continue following her, as she explains her backstory.
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|My family had gathered that day to celebrate my elder sister. She had just completed her training as a [[Druids of the Talon|Druid of the Talon]].}}
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|We lived in the village of [[Dolanaar]], high in the branches of [[Teldrassil]]. We had heard [[War of the Thorns|war]] might be coming but we never thought...}}
:''Kelestra stops by a [[Barrowstone]].''

;To the second Barrowstone
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|We were told we had to evacuate. But there was so much chaos. So much fire. Even now, what I remember most was the smell.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|The path to [[Darnassus]] was cut off by the blaze. My sister instead led us east, to the edge of the crown of Teldrassil. She had a plan.}}
:''Kelestra stops by the second Barrowstone.''

;To the third Barrowstone
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|She wanted us to jump from the tree. She would use her powers over wind to keep us aloft and glide down to the shore below.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|But something went wrong. As we drifted along, she was struck by a burning branch. It ignited her clothing and engulfed her in flames.}}

;To the fourth Barrowstone
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|She lost control of her magic. We all plummeted into the sea below. I was badly hurt in the fall, but I managed to survive.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|The rest of my family... was not so lucky.}}

With all Barrostones collected, Kelestra heads to the silhouette of [[Burial Stones]].
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|Over time, I eventually recovered the remains of my parents and brother. I never found my sister.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|Her grave is likely at the bottom of the [[Veiled Sea]].}}

Place the Burial Stones:
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|But sometimes I wonder if my sister might have survived the jump off Teldrassil.}}
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|If anyone could survive that fall, it would be Koroleth.}}
:''[[Rashan Stillbrook]] stands up and turns to Kelestra.''
:{{Text|say|Rashan Stillbrook|Koroleth was your sister?! She was a [[Primalists|Primalist]] and a traitor! She deserved her fate!}}
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|That... that can't be true...}}
:''Rashan approaches Kelestra.''
:{{Text|say|Rashan Stillbrook|If you don't believe me, go speak with the other Primalist traitors at the [[Twilight Watchtower]]. They will tell you the truth.}}
:''Rashan walks away.''

Speak with Kelestra:
{{Dialogue|
<Kelestra looks distraught, and her hands are shaking.>

Is what he said true? Do you know anything about Koroleth?

{{Gossip|quest=|<Say that Koroleth was a Primalist.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|
{{Text|say|Kelestra|My sister...  a traitor...}}
}}
{{Gossip|quest=|<Say that Koroleth was a Primalist and she fell in battle.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|
{{Text|say|Kelestra|Then not only was she a traitor, but she can never redeem herself...}}
}}
{{Gossip|quest=|<Say that Koroleth was a Primalist and [[Stormbreaker (quest)|you killed her in battle]].>}}
{{Dialogue-child|
{{Text|say|Kelestra|What? It was you? You... you killed her?}}
}}
{{Gossip|quest=|<Say you don't know anything.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|
{{Text|say|Kelestra|I need to find out what happened to my sister!}}
