==Objectives==
Meet [[Kelestra]] at the [[Twilight Watchtower]].

==Description==
I must speak with the [[Primalists]]. I don't understand why she would turn her back on us.

Koroleth saved my life at [[Teldrassil]]. I owe it to her to find out the truth.

<Name>, I realize this might be awkward, but will you help me? I can no longer bear this alone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|80|90}}
*5x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Thank you for coming <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Kelestra|[[Rashan Stillbrook|That druid]] said the other Primalists are at the Twilight Watchtower. I will meet you there <name>.}}
:''Kelestra runs out of the barrow den.''

Follow suit and head across the island to the tower. On the edge of [[Viridescent Thicket]], Kelestra is talking with [[Malathra Nighthelm]]:
:{{Text|say|Malathra Nighthelm|Very well, you have my permission to speak with them.}}

Malathra has gossip:
{{Dialogue|
I have been charged with watching over these former Primalists as they repent for their crimes.

{{gossip|<Ask what has become of the Primalists after the war.>}}
{{Dialogue-child|
The Primalists suffered heavy losses during [[Raszageth]]'s [[Vault of the Incarnates|initial campaign]] and even more casualties during [[Fyrakk]]'s [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope|assault on Amirdrassil]].

[[Vyranoth]]'s defection was another major blow to their numbers, causing many Primalists to switch sides.

Those who remained were either captured as prisoners of war or scattered to the winds after Fyrakk's defeat.

<Malathra Nighthelm pauses in contemplation.>

The Primalists are defeated but not destroyed. They will go into hiding once again and bide their time until called upon.

And do not forget--there is still [[Iridikron|one Incarnate]] out there to call upon them.
