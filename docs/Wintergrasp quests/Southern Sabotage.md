==Objectives==
Destroy [[Shadowsight Tower]], [[Flamewatch Tower]] or [[Winter's Edge Tower]] and return to [[Tactical Officer Ahbramis]] in [[Wintergrasp]].
*Destroy one of the three southern towers

==Description==
The three towers south of the Wintergrasp river are draining power from the Fortress!

Destroy Shadowsight Tower, Flamewatch Tower or Winter's Edge Tower, then return to me.  Remember, only siege vehicles can damage a tower, so make sure to protect them from the [[Horde]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}} (+{{cost|13|23}} at max level)
*10 [[Stone Keeper's Shard]]

==Progress==
Do you bring word from the south?

==Completion==
I heard the explosion from here!  Excellent job - we've already begun rerouting the power into the Titan relic to super-charge our own forces.
