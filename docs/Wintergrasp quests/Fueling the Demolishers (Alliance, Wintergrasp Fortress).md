==Objectives==
[[Siege Master Stouthandle]] at [[Wintergrasp Fortress]] wants you to retrieve 10 Eternal Embers from [[Horde]] players at the [[Cauldron of Flames]].
*[[Eternal Ember (Wintergrasp)]] (10)

==Description==
<Name>! About time you showed up. While the battle may be over, we still need to prepare for the next battle. Travel to the Cauldron of Flames in south eastern [[Wintergrasp]] and retrieve several eternal embers.

The embers are mixed in with [[:coal]] to fuel the Demolisher and Siege Engines.

Oh, and if you happen to see some of the Horde in the Cauldron, don't hesitate to slay them and take their embers. We can't let them have the advantage in the next battle.

==Rewards==
{{cost|7|40|a-hp=16}}

==Progress==
Well? Did you manage to find the embers or did the Horde beat you to it and leave you crying?

==Completion==
Excellent! This will help fuel the flames of war for days to come.
