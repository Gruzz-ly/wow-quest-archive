==Description==
[[Primalist Mulfort]] in [[Wintergrasp]] wants you to retrieve 10 Alliance Herb Pouches from Alliance players at the [[Steppe of Life]].
*[[Alliance Herb Pouch]] (10)

==Description==
So many of our braves were lost during the battle, but even more shall die if left untreated.

Travel to the Steppe of Life in southwestern Wintergrasp. I have need of the roses that grow there for salve to treat the wounded.

Sadly, the rose has become scarce due to the Alliance harvesting it too rapidly. Slay them on the Steppe of Life and retrieve their herb pouches from the bodies.

If that fails, perhaps a lasher or two might be in bloom.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40|}}
*12,190 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to recover the herbs? The sick and wounded increase by the hour.

==Completion==
Thank you, this will go far to treat our soldier's wounds.

==Notes==
*As of patch 3.2.0, Mature Lashers now also drop [[Alliance Herb Pouch]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2009-02-25|bluenote=We have increased the drop rate for the quest items required to complete the quest.}}
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
