== Objectives ==
[[Bowyer Randolph]] at [[Wintergrasp Fortress]] wants you to retrieve 10 Quivers of Dragonbone Arrows from Horde players at the Forest of Shadows. 
* [[Quiver of Dragonbone Arrows]] (10)

== Description ==
Dragons are incredible! Well, their bones at least! I've been equipping our archers with arrowheads made of Dragonbone. Unfortunately, since the massacre at [[Angrathar]], it has become almost impossible to get bone from [[Dragonblight]].

However, the [[Forest of Shadows]] on the western edge of [[Wintergrasp]] has enough bones to tide us over.

Head to the Forest of Shadows and bring back any bone splinters you can find!

The Horde have been seen collecting bone splinters in the area. Slay them!

== Rewards ==
{{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
How was the hunting? I've heard rumors the place is haunted, though I never venture out there myself.

==Completion==
Excellent! This will help fuel the flames of war for days to come.
