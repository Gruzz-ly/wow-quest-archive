==Description==
Anchorite Tessa in Wintergrasp Fortress wants you to retrieve 10 Horde Herb Pouches from Horde players in the Steppe of Life.
* [[Horde Herb Pouch]] (10)

== Description ==
My, it its quite chilly up here! Reminds me of the stormy peaks of [[Kaarinos]] on [[Argus]]. However, with all of this snow and ice, our soldiers can easily catch cold.

Head to the Steppe of Life in southwestern Wintergrasp, and bring me back 10 of the flowing red plants you find. I will grind them into a medicine to help protect against the cold.

The Horde have been seen collecting them from the plant life in the area. Do not hesitate to slay them and retrieve the herbs!

== Progress==
I hope you didn't pull up any of the lashers by mistake! They gave Private Doane quite a whipping last week.

== Completion ==
Excellent! This will help protect our troops against the cold.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40|}}

== Notes ==
* Drop rates from non-player [[Living Lasher]] mobs are reportedly too low (&lt;20%) to make this quest worthwhile, since players almost only go to the [[Steppe of Life]] for this type of quest.

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2009-02-25|bluenote=We have increased the drop rate for the quest items required to complete the quest.}}
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
