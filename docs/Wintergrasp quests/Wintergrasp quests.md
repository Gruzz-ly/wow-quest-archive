# Wintergrasp quests

[[File:WorldMap-LakeWintergrasp.jpg|thumb|Map of Wintergrasp]]

There are two sets of [[weekly quest]]s in [[Wintergrasp]]. They are obtained from quest NPCs in Wintergrasp Keep for the defending faction; the attacking faction's quest NPCs are at the site of the incoming portal from [[Dalaran]]. When a battle for control of Wintergrasp Keep begins, the quest NPCs despawn.

The quests can be completed over multiple battles for control of Wintergrasp Keep. They can be completed while part of a raid group.
As of [[patch 3.1.2]] all Wintergrasp daily quests have been changed to a weekly format.

== Weekly PvP quests ==
;Alliance
* [[Defend the Siege (Alliance)]]  or [[Stop the Siege (Alliance)]] ''(see below)''
* [[No Mercy for the Merciless]]
* [[Southern Sabotage]]
* [[Victory in Wintergrasp (Alliance)]]
* {{Alliance|}} [25-30] ''Rotating weekly PvP quest (see below)''

;Horde
* [[Defend the Siege (Horde)]] or [[Stop the Siege (Horde)]] ''(see below)''
* [[Slay them all!]]
* [[Toppling the Towers]]
* [[Victory in Wintergrasp (Horde)]]
* {{Horde|}} [25-30] ''Rotating weekly PvP quest (see below)''

If you are attacking Wintergrasp Keep, the quest [[Defend the Siege|Defend the Siege]] is available to you; if you are defending the keep, [[Stop the Siege|Stop the Siege]] is available to you. The quest objectives are the same, and can be fulfilled if you are attacking or defending.

== Rotating weekly PvP quests ==
Only one of these quests is available per week; even though they come from different quest NPCs, you cannot have more than one of these quests at a time. The quests can be completed while a member of a raid group, and all members of the raid can loot the quest item off of a single body.

Killing and looting dead enemy players in the specified regions will yield five of the quest item; the different elementals will always drop one of the item. If you control Wintergrasp Keep, the elemental Revenants will drop two of the quest item instead.

Kill enemy players or [[Living Lasher]]s in The Steppes of Life for [[Horde Herb Pouch]] or [[Alliance Herb Pouch]]:
* [[A Rare Herb]] / [[Healing with Roses]]

Kill enemy players, [[Wandering Shadow]]s or [[Shadow Revenant]]s in the Forest of Shadows for [[Quiver of Dragonbone Arrows]]:
* [[Bones and Arrows]]

Kill enemy players, [[Raging Flame]]s or [[Flame Revenant]]s in the Cauldron of Flames for [[Eternal Ember (Wintergrasp)]]:
* Fortress captured by player's side: [[Fueling the Demolishers (Alliance, Wintergrasp Fortress)]] / [[Fueling the Demolishers (Horde, Wintergrasp Fortress)]]
* Fortress captured by the other side: [[Fueling the Demolishers (Alliance, Wintergrasp)]] / [[Fueling the Demolishers (Horde, Wintergrasp)]]

Kill enemy players, [[Glacial Spirit]]s or [[Water Revenant]]s at the Glacial Falls for [[Enchanted Alliance Breastplate]] or [[Imbued Horde Armor]]. The quests are different based on if the faction controls the fortress or not, but the quest objectives are the same:
* Fortress captured by player's side: [[Warding the Warriors (Wintergrasp Fortress)]] / [[Warding the Walls]]
* Fortress captured by the other side: [[Warding the Warriors]] / [[Jinxing the Walls]]
