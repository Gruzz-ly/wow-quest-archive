== Objectives ==
Siegesmith Stouthandle in [[Wintergrasp]] wants you to retrieve 10 Eternal Embers from [[Horde]] players at the [[Cauldron of Flames]]. 
* [[Eternal Ember (Wintergrasp)]] (10)

== Description ==
<Name>! About time you showed up. While we may have lost the last battle, we should prepare for the next! Travel to the Cauldron of Flames in south eastern Wintergrasp and retrieve several eternal embers.

The embers are mixed in with [[coal]] to fuel the Demolisher and Siege Engines.

Oh, and if you happen to see some of the Horde in the Cauldron, don't hesitate to slay them and take their embers. We must prevent them from holding the [[Wintergrasp Fortress|keep]]! 

{{text|say|Siege Master Stouthandle|Stop the Horde from retrieving the embers, <name>. We cannot risk them having the advantage when the battle resumes!}}

== Rewards ==
{{cost|7|40|a-hp=16}}

== Progress ==
Well? Did you manage to find the embers or did the Horde beat you to it and leave you crying?

== Completion ==
Excellent! This will help fuel the flames of war for days to come. 

== Notes ==
* The Cauldron of Flames can be found at {{coords|84.2|71.7|Wintergrasp}}.
* There are actually 2 quests depending on whether your faction controls the [[Wintergrasp Fortress]] or not.
