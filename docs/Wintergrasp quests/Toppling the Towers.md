==Objectives==
Destroy [[Shadowsight Tower]], [[Flamewatch Tower]], or [[Winter's Edge Tower]] and return to [[Tactical Officer Kilrath]] in [[Wintergrasp]].
* Destroy a southern tower in Wintergrasp

==Description==
While the Alliance may be pounding on our doors, a true tactician looks beyond the obvious.

"Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected."

<Name>, I need you to travel across the Wintergrasp River and destroy one of the three towers to the south. Our Warlocks report that the towers are draining power we could use to bolster our own troops.

Return to me once you've destroyed a tower.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|40}} (+{{cost|13|23}} at level 80)
* 10 [[Stone Keeper's Shard]]

==Progress==
My disgust for Warlocks is only exceeded by my hate for the undead. However, they can both prove useful at times.

==Completion==
Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards. I hope that these are sufficient for your service to the Horde.

==Patch changes==
