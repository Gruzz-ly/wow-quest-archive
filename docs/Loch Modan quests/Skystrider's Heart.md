==Objectives==
Return the Supermechanical Robo-Widget to [[Bingles Blastenheimer]] at the [[Farstrider Lodge]].

==Description==
Opening the hatch, you find an imposing looking mechanical device hooked to several wires, gears, and who knows what else.

It's easily detached. Time to bring it back to Bingles.

You will receive:
*{{coppercost|2000}} (or {{coppercost|1260}} at max level)
*2050 [[XP] (or {{coppercost|1260}} at max level)
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Completion==
Perfect! Now that I've perfected the wing balance and have all the parts I need, all we need is a pilot.
