==Objectives==
Collect 6 Glassy Hornet Wings.
*[[Glassy Hornet Wing]] (6)

==Description==
We're always looking for new game around here. [[Daryl the Youngling|Daryl]] may like his [[boar]]s, but the rest of us prefer something more exotic.

Now, I'd never say the [[Loch Modan|Loch]] draining was a good thing, but it did have a silver lining. The swampy ground's brought in new prey:  Hornets!

Giant hornets, mind you.  Not many [[hunter]]s have tussled with massive bugs before. It's rather novel.

If you'd like to give it a try, I'll wager with you. Bring me back some of those nice glossy wings of theirs and I'll pay up.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||8}}
*1450 [[XP]] (or {{cost||9}} at level 85)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
How go those wasps?

==Completion==
Lovely specimens you've got there! Here's my wager, <lad/lass>.
