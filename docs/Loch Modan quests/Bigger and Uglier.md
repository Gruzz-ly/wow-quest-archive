== Objectives ==
Kill 8 Stonesplinter Shaman and 8 Stonesplinter Bonesnappers.
* [[Stonesplinter Shaman]] slain (8)
* [[Stonesplinter Bonesnapper]] slain (8)

== Description ==
The Mountaineers tell me you are quite brave and capable, <name>. We need a <race> like you around here. The [[Trogg]] problem isn't getting any better. The reserves have been called to the front and we're all alone out here. But now that we have a seasoned <class> here, let's see what you can do.

Go out and kill 8 Stonesplinter Shaman and 8 Stonesplinter Bonesnappers. You should find them in and around the caves in the southern mountains.

Let's see if you live up to your reputation, Trogg-Slayer.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Trogg-Slayer Boots
|Mountaineer's Belt
|Bonesnapper Bracers
|Bonesnapper Cuffs
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 930 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

{{itembox||q1=3|Coarse Sharpening Stone
}}

== Progress ==
Back so soon? In case I didn't make myself clear we need you to kill 8 Stonesplinter Shaman and 8 Stonesplinter Bonesnappers, <name>. Now go get 'em, Trogg-Slayer!

== Completion ==
I knew the second I laid eyes on you, <name>, that you would make Ironforge proud.  You have served our people well. I salute you, <name>.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Decisive Strike]] before heading out. Back to the northeast, take the first right, then bear left and enter the cave. Clear a path to the bottom to find Grawmug at {{co|34.3|61.2|Loch Modan}} on top of the platform in the center of the last room. Circle around counterclockwise to get to him. There's a hole leading back toward the entrance near Grawmug, so take it to keep the excess killing to a minimum.
