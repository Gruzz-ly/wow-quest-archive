== Objectives ==
Find Pilot Hildelve north of [[Helm's Bed Lake]].

== Description ==
My friend and fellow Siege Engine pilot, [[Mori Hildelve]], is lost in the hills. We were looking for a rare ore that's needed for a high-grade blastpowder, and during our search he drove his engine up a steep hill and busted it!

Still convinced that ore was in these mountains, Hildelve charged me to guard our engines while he continued on foot.

It's been days, and I've heard some beastly growls north of Helm's Bed Lake, west of the tunnel. Mori's tough as nails, but I'm worried.

Please, <name>. Find him.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mori's Gear Stick
|Mori's Compass
|Mori's Cloak
|Mori's Pocketknife
}}

You will also receive:
* 740 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
* +75 reputation with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

== Completion ==
Here is the corpse of a dwarf -- mauled, frozen, and picked clean by mountain scavengers.  Clutched in its hand is a book containing the roughly scribbled notes of Mori Hildelve.  And around its frame, still in superior condition, is a Brigadier's Vest.

This grisly scene must have been where the Siege Engine pilot met his end.

== Notes ==
Head west back through the [[South Gate Pass]] in to [[Dun Morogh]]. Follow the road and look off to the north to find a grisly scene.
