==Objectives==
Kill 7 Mo'grosh ogres in the [[Mo'grosh Stronghold]].
* Mo'grosh Ogre slain (7)

==Description==
The [[Twilight's Hammer]] started as a clan of the savage Horde.  Their leader, [[Cho'gall]], slowly turned his band of ogres into a death cult, welcoming anyone insane enough to wish for the end of all existence.  As you can see, there's still plenty of ogres among their ranks:  deranged, fanatical, and just as strong as before.

These crude monsters have the gall to come here and spread their filth across our land.  The more you kill, the better off [[Loch Modan]] will be, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||20}}
*1700 [[XP]]
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
Don't falter now, <name>.

==Completion==
It may look grim, but we'll win with your help, <name>.  They won't keep the dwarves down.

==Notes==
Any ogre in Mo'grosh Stronghold counts for this quest.
