==Objectives==
Collect 3 Pristine Flight Feathers from [[Golden Eagle]]s.
*[[Pristine Flight Feather]] (3)

==Description==
I'm through with [[gyrocopter]]s. Sure, they work, but when has that ever been good enough for a real [[gnome]]? I want real flight, with WINGS!

I've been studying birds for years now, trying to unlock the final secret to building a machine that flies just like them. That elegant soaring and swooping, the rush of wind over the wings, ahh.

You! You can help me. I need the finest flight feathers you can find. The golden eagles circling near the lodge would be a fine choice...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|900}} (or {{coppercost|960}} at max level)
*1600 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|960}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
Only the finest feathers will do! 

==Completion==
Beautiful. you've{{Sic}} got an eye for quality!

Great minds think alike! It's clear you've got an enthusiasm for flight and fowl, so maybe you can help me further...
