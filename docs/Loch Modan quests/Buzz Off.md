==Objectives==
Kill 8 Loch Buzzards.
*[[Loch Buzzard]] slain (8)

==Description==
When the [[Stonewrought Dam]] burst, it drained near the entire [[The Loch|loch]]. Horrible ecological devastation.

And don't you go thinking it didn't really affect us dwarves! Not only are we plumb out of fish, but there's acres of dead [[threshadon]]s out there left to rot in the sun. The buzzards are after them, and they're spreading all manner of filth and disease right on the outskirts of town.

I can't ask you to clean it all up, but could you deal with the buzzards? Killin' even just a few will help.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||7}} (or {{cost||8|40}} at max level)

==Progress==
Plenty of 'em flappin' around yet, <lad/lass>.

==Completion==
That should help prevent disease and illness from spreading into our remaining water. Many thanks, <name>.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Smells Like A Plan]] and [[A Load of Croc]] before heading out. Since players are near the Loch, remember that [[Gorick's Stash List]] mentions the fishing dock near Thelsamar. The stolen document can be found just to the northeast of Kadrell at {{co|41.4|39.0|Loch Modan}} by the old waterline. Collect it and pick up [[Explorers' League Document (2 of 6)]] before heading back to Thelsamar.

Head east, down into the loch and start killing. Murlocs are along the loch's west coast, while the crocolisks and buzzards are down to the south.

While at the southern end of what's left of the loch, note the [[Mosshide Representative]] at {{co|50.6|56.1|Loch Modan}} speaking to a few [[Bluegill Representative]]s with a [[Tunnel Rat Lackey]] in attendance. Maybe there is some truth to the rumors.
