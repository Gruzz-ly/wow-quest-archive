== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Commander Nazrim.jpg|"Commander" Nazrim|Look for the kobold with the longest candle.}}
Slay Commander Nazrim.
* [["Commander" Nazrim]] slain

== Description ==
We've dealt with [[kobold]]s in these lands for years. Not much other than a nuisance. But they've been getting craftier at their stealing.

I think one of them's ended up smarter than usual. Won't be that way for long, though!

I want you to go to the camp south of here and make sure there's not a "big shot" kobold stirrin' up the other ones. Make sure to check the cave; it's a likely spot.

And don't be shy about clearing out the other kobolds along the way.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}} (or {{cost||7|20}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Don't forget to find that "commander" down in the cave.

== Completion ==
So I was right! Now the question is what the little freaks were plotting...

== Notes ==
Head southwest to the unnamed kobold camp. A noticeable cave can be found, where at "Commander" Nazrim awaits inside.

==Progression==
{{Loch Modan storyline}}

==Trivia==
*The character "Commander" Nazrim is a reference to a character named Nazrin from the Touhou Project. Her theme song is named "A Tiny, Tiny, Clever Commander", which the quest takes its name from.
