==Objectives==
Find the [[Rusted Skystrider]] inside [[Ironwing Cavern]].

==Description==
I've actually nearly perfected my dream machine: The Skystrider! The world's first flying [[Mechanostrider]]! But, well?

When I was putting the finishing touches on it in my secret cavern lab, my other creations became, er, jealous. Giving mechanical birds a personality to begin with was probably a bad idea, but that's already done.

I need the Supermechanical Robo-Widget from the original Skystrider if I want to rebuild it! Please, journey into the cave and retrieve it for me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*680 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|420}} at max level)

==Completion==
<The Skystrider sits silent, its chance to fly gone. An obvious hatch on the front is marked "SRW".> 

==Trivia==
*The name is likely a reference to {{wp|Surfin' Bird}} by {{wp|The Trashmen}}.

==Progression==
{{:Wing Nut}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
