==Objectives==
Kill 12 {{NPC||Stonesplinter Trogg}}s or {{NPC||Stonesplinter Scout}}s.
*Stonesplinter Trogg slain (12)

==Description==
We need to protect the Loch, <name>! With so many of the King's soldiers fighting valiantly on remote battlefields, we've become overwhelmed on the home front. [[Trogg]]s are tunneling up from every crevice! The trogg infestation poses the largest threat to [[Ironforge]].

We need you, brave [[adventurer]], to venture forth and lay waste to the trogg threat. Slay twelve stonesplinter troggs and venture back.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Stone Stompers
|Leggings of Uncanny Courage

|Greaves of Uncanny Courage
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||5|65}}
*930 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

{{itembox||q1=5|Dalaran Sharp
}}

==Progress==
Loch Modan is under siege, <name>! We need every able-bodied member of the Alliance to aid our cause. Have you killed those troggs yet?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>! You demonstrated uncanny courage on the battlefield. Our war against the Troggs will be won with efforts such as yours.  You have served {{NPC||Magni Bronzebeard||King Magni}} well.

==Notes==
Pick up [[The Trogg Threat]] before heading out. Head northwest between the two statues and take the first right to enter [[Stonesplinter Valley]], trogg country. Then go on a genocidal rampage.
