==Objectives==
Ride the Skystrider to [[Algaz Station]] and then speak with [[Mountaineer Stormpike]].

==Description==
Father finished the Skystrider. It's amazing! Once we get the bugs worked out, I'm going to use it to fight for justice, just like you.

I know you've got to move on, and help other people, being a hero and all, but how about a ride? I'm about to take the Skystrider on its first flight, and I'll be honored if you join me. I'll drop you off at Algaz Station.

What do you say?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1000}} (or {{coppercost|840}} at max level)
*1350 XP (or {{coppercost|840}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Completion==
What in blazes WAS that? A flying [[mechanostrider]]?

You know what, I don't want to know. I'm just going to pretend that didn't happen, and we'll be all nice and businesslike. 

==Notes==
The skystrider you mount is a swift mechanostrider that is jet propelled.  It comes with the miniature wings, but somehow the gnomes make those work for flight.

==Patch changes==
