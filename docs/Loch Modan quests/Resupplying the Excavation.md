==Objectives==
Locate {{NPC||Huldar}}, {{NPC||Miran}}, and {{NPC||Saean}}.
*Find Huldar, Miran and Saean

==Description==
Ironband has an [[Ironband's Excavation Site|excavation]] to the southeast and he's been needing a hefty amount of explosives sent from [[Explorers' League|the league]] for all the carving. Huldar, Miran, and Saean just departed with the most recent load and could probably use a hand.

They can't have made it very far, strong as they are. They can only move so fast laden down with those barrels.

They're taking the normal route to the site, leaving south out of town and following the curve of the Loch. Go catch up with them and help'm out, will ya?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

==Completion==
Hmph, it'll take more than a Dark Iron ambush to stop the deliveries!

But Saean... I would never have suspected him to be one of their sympathizers. We've been working with him for almost a year now... maybe I missed the signs.

Well, I'll consider that later.

==Notes==
Head southeast along the old loch waterline. Just past the southernmost point of the loch at {{co|56.4|66.0|Loch Modan}} are Huldar and Miran, beset by Saean and three Dark Iron Ambushers!

Southeast of Huldar and Miran is one of the locations mentioned in [[Gorick's Stash List]]: {{NPC||Shanda the Spinner}}'s den. At {{co|61.7|73.2|Loch Modan}} immediately outside of the den is the third Explorers' League Document. Collect it to start [[Explorers' League Document (3 of 6)]].
