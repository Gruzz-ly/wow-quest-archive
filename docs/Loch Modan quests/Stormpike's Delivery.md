==Objectives==
Deliver the [[Package for Stormpike]] to [[Mountaineer Stormpike]] in [[Loch Modan]].

[[Package for Stormpike]] (Provided)

==Description==
The Stormpikes are a respected dwarven clan, and are well known for their fine and discerning tastes. So it's no wonder that Gringer Stormpike, a Mountaineer of [[Ironforge]], commissioned me to craft him a weapon.

The weapon is finished, but... Mountaineer Stormpike is far away, in distant Loch Modan. If you plan on traveling to the north, can you deliver this package to him?

My last message from Mountaineer Stormpike said he's stationed at the northern [[guard tower]] in Loch Modan.

==Progress==
You come all the way from Stormwind?  I hear it's getting dicey down there in the human lands, with brigands and orcs running about.  A perfect place for a <class> to prove his worth!

==Completion==
Aha!  So Grimand finally finished my axe!  I can't wait to try it against some troggs and kobolds!

Many thanks, <name>.  It was a long distance to travel for this delivery.   Here are some coins for your efforts.

==Reward==

* {{cost||7}}
* 110-1050 XP
