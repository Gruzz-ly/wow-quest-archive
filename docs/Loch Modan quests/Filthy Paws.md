==Objectives==
Collect 6 loads of Miners' Gear from the [[Silver Stream Mine]].
*[[Miners' Gear]] (6)

==Description==
The Silver Stream Mine to the east ran dry long ago. It was converted by the Miners' League into a storage depot, but now [[kobold]]s have moved in, putting their filthy paws on good, dwarven tools!

We'll root out those vermin soon enough, but the League wants someone to get their gear out of the mine before we warriors tromp in there and break things. It'll be a tough delve - you might want cohorts at your side.

The gear is stored in [[Miners' League]] Crates throughout the mine. Good luck.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Ironheart Chain Cloak|Silver Stream Shield|Filthy Paw}}
You will also receive: {{cost||6}} (or {{cost||7|20}} at max level)

==Progress==
Do you have that Miners' Gear, <name>?

==Completion==
Did you see a lot of kobolds in there? The thought of their grimy hands clawing around our mine makes my stomach rumble!

==Notes==
Pick up [[Who's In Charge Here?]] and [[A Nasty Exploit]] before heading out.

Back to the mine, but this time, heading into the mine itself! Go killing geomancers, looting gear and getting to Foreman Sharpsneer, found at {{co|34.7|26.8|Loch Modan}} all the way at the southern end of the mine.
