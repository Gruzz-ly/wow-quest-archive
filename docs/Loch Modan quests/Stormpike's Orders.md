== Objectives ==
Deliver Stormpike's Orders to {{NPC||Mountaineer Stormpike}} at [[Algaz Station]].

== Description ==
I need to get some orders up to Mountaineer Stormpike at his post in Algaz Station. If you wouldn't mind taking them, just follow the road all the way up to the northwest and you'll be sure to see the main bunker.

If you'd like to lend a hand in accomplishing his tasks, we'd be glad to reward you for that as well.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||4}} (or {{cost||4|20}} at max level)

== Completion ==
Orders! Let's see what we have here... hah! He wants me to deal with the infestation of rat men. We're already in the middle of that, so no real deviation there.

Care to lend a hand?

== Notes ==
Head north out of Thelsamar to reach Algaz. Stormpike is outside of the bunker.
