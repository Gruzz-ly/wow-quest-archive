== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Grawmug.jpg|Grawmug|Kill him!}}
Kill Grawmug.
*[[Grawmug]] slain

== Description ==
It appears that these beasts in [[Loch Modan]] are following the lead of a chieftain named Grawmug. He's the biggest of all the [[trogg]]s here, lurking deep within the darkness of the caves to the north.

If you feel yourself worthy, <name>, I want you to lead the assassination mission on Grawmug.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Rugelfuss Bracers
|Belt of the Valley of Kings
|Unbound Leggings
|Waistguard of the Valley of Kings
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||11|30}}
* 1,100 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

== Progress ==
Your mission is not complete until Grawmug and his two guards have been brought to death. [[Khaz Modan]] is counting on you, <name>.

== Completion ==
Most excellent, <name>! You have brought hope to Loch Modan. With Grawmug dead, we stand a better chance of seeing the Troggs eliminated from the land.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Bigger and Uglier]] before heading out. Back to the northeast, take the first right, then bear left and enter the cave. Clear a path to the bottom to find Grawmug at {{co|34.3|61.2|Loch Modan}} on top of the platform in the center of the last room. Circle around counterclockwise to get to him. There's a hole leading back toward the entrance near Grawmug, so take it to keep the excess killing to a minimum.

==Progression==
{{Loch Modan storyline}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 7.0.3|note=[[Waistguard of the Valley of Kings]] added as a reward.}}
