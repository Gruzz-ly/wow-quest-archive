== Objectives ==
Return the [[Explorers' League]] Document to {{NPC||Torren Squarejaw}} in [[Thelsamar]].

== Description ==
The document bears the Explorer's League crest and contains a detailed list of the artifacts exacavated by Ironband's workers in southeastern Loch Modan. Sooty smudges lead you to believe it was likely stolen by the Dark Iron spies in the area.

You recall mention of missing documents at the Explorer's League building in Thelsamar.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||16}}

== Completion ==
Our artifact records! I was pretty well worried what the Dark Irons might try to steal with this information at their disposal.

Thank you for bringing this back to us. We'll gladly part with some coin to express our gratitude.

== Notes ==
This document can be found slightly to the south of the [[Twilight Camp]].

See [[Gorick's Stash List]] for the locations of the other five.

==Progression==

== Patch changes ==
