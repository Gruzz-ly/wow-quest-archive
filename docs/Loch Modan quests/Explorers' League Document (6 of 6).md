== Objectives ==
Return the [[Explorers' League]] Document to {{NPC||Torren Squarejaw}} in [[Thelsamar]].

== Description ==
The document bears the Explorers' League crest and contains detailed assessments of the various threats present within Loch Modan. Sooty smudges lead you to believe it was likely stolen by the Dark Iron spies in the area.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||18}}

== Completion ==
Hah! Think they got a kick out of seeing how low they were on our list of threat assessments? This document was admittedly a bit of out of date, but none the less amusing.

Of course, we'll offer you some money as a reward for returning this anyway - your efforts are appreciated!

== Notes ==
This document can be found right next to a skull-carved rock a little to the south of the Ogre-populated [[Mo'grosh Stronghold]].

See [[Gorick's Stash List]] for the locations of the other five.

==Progression==
{{Loch Modan storyline}}

== Patch changes ==
