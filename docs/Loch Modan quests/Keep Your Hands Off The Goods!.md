== Objectives ==
Inspect the Upturned Giant Artifact, the Overdressed Woman Artifact, and the Broken Tablet Artifact.
* Artifact of the Upturned Giant Inspected
* Artifact of the Overdressed Woman Inspected
* Artifact of the Broken Tablet Inspected

== Description ==
We've uncovered some incredible artifacts at [[Ironband's Excavation Site|this site]]. It's hard to be convinced that it's all authentic, but there could be serious historical potential.

Unfortunately, when the [[trogg]]s overan the site, we lost access to three of our most notable finds to date. I'm concerned that the troggs might have stolen them or defiled them in our absence.

If you go into the excavation, find the Upturned Giant, the Overdressed Woman, and the Broken Tablet, and make sure they're still intact.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||8}}

== Progress ==
Are all of our artifacts still there? Are they damaged?

== Completion ==
Woo! I'm relieved... I was worried they'd all be destroyed by now. Thank you for checking in on them.

== Notes ==
Head in to the dig. [[Gorick's Stash List]] indicates that another stolen explorers' league document is in the excavation. It can be found at {{co|68.1|66.1|Loch Modan}} in a somewhat hidden area. Collect it to start [[Explorers' League Document (4 of 6)]].

The overdressed woman is a reference to the {{wp|Statue of Liberty}} in [[wikipedia:Planet of the Apes|Planet of the Apes]]. In the earlier pre-vanilla stages of WoW, the same model was on Stranglethorn Vale's beach as a more obvious reference.
