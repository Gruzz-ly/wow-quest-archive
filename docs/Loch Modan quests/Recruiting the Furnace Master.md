==Objectives==
Recruit [[Ignis the Furnace Master]] to help smelt the metal.
* Travel to [[Ulduar]]
* [[Titan Flame]] slain (6)
* [[Magmarion of the Furnace]] slain
*Return to Brann Bronzebeard in [[Loch Modan]].

==Description==
[[Grumnus Steelshaper‎|Grumnus]] says we're going to need some help smelting this metal. I just happen to know someone who's perfect for the job.

We're heading to Ulduar!

Years ago, we fought against a construct named Ignis the Furnace Master. I've heard tell that the [[titan keeper]]s brought him back, and Ulduar's furnace is alive once more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's been a long time since I've been in Ulduar.

==Completion==
With Ignis's help, we're one step closer to reforging this armor!

==Notes==
Head to [[Ulduar]] in the [[Storm Peaks]]. The time is set to night. Inside is [[Brann Bronzebeard]].

;On approach
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Ulduar. I haven't been here in years. It seems the titan keepers have been busy restoring it.}}
:''Brann runs further in.''

True to Brann's words, the area is filled with [[Mechanolift 305-C]], [[Steelforged Assistant]]s, [[Runeforged Sentry (NPC)|Runeforged Sentries]], [[Clockwork Mechanic (NPC)|Clockwork Mechanics]], [[Storm Leviathan MK. II]], and [[XT-003 Deconstuctor]].

Follow Brann.
:{{text|yell|Brann Bronzebeard|Quickly, <name>! Ignis needs help!}}

Head to the Colossal Forge where Ignis is fighting [[Magmarion of the Furnace]].

Slay 6 Titan Flames while you head to Ignis.
:{{text|yell|Ignis the Furnace Master|Back into the forge with you!}}

Use the action button on Magmarion of the Furnace and defeat it.
:{{text|yell|Ignis the Furnace Master|Thank you, small one. The forge is once again under my control.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Ignis! We're in need of yer aid. My friend and I are tryin' tae reforge a suit of ancient dwarven armor.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|The Great Forge can no longer produce the heat required to smelt the metal... not without your help.}}
:{{text|yell|Ignis the Furnace Master|A bold undertaking. In gratitude for your assistance, I offer you my own. When the time comes, I will light the flame.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Thank ye, furnace master.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Fine work, friend! If ye need a lift home, we can take my flying machine. Follow me!}}

Brann starts running out and you must follow him. There, [[Brann's Flying Machine]] awaits. It has a gossip:
{{Dialogue|<Brann's Flying Machine is ready for take off.>

{{Gossip|I am ready to go back to Loch Modan.}}
}}

The player character is sent back to [[Thelsamar]]. Meet with Brann at the [[Stoutlager Inn]] to turn in.
