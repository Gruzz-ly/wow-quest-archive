== Objectives ==
Slay 5 Tunnel Rat Surveyors and 5 Tunnel Rat Foragers.
* [[Tunnel Rat Surveyor]] slain x5
*[[Tunnel Rat Forager]] slain x5

== Description ==
Now that those little blighters are dealt with, we've got more to take care of.

The tunnel rats are swarming all over the [[Silver Stream Mine]], setting up camps and sniffing around further and further every day. Greedy little things are looking for loot, I gather.

Surveying and foraging is all fine and dandy when it's not on dwarven land! Take care of those tunnel rats and report back to me.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}} (or {{cost||7|20}} at max level)

== Progress ==
We'll deal with the mine proper once you've cleaned up the outer perimeter.

== Completion ==
Good, good. Now we can see what's going on down in that mine.

== Notes ==
Head east along the path and start killing. Stay on the surface, as the kobolds in the mine are not part of this quest.

==Progression==

== Patch changes ==
