== Objectives ==
Speak to {{NPC||Gryth Thurden}} at the [[Great Forge]] for a flight to [[Loch Modan]]. Speak with {{NPC||Pilot Hammerfoot}} when you arrive.

== Description ==
I've been waiting for [[Council of Three Hammers|the council]] to hear my plea for hours, and it's not looking good. [[Moira Thaurissan|Moira's]] greatest desire seems to be to paralyze the council.

Meanwhile, Loch Modan suffers. Our enemies are many and our resources are few. Please, <name>, perhaps you will hear me if the council will not. Speak to Gryth Thurden, [[Ironforge]]'s gryphon master. He's in the eastern part of the Great Forge. He'll provide a free flight to the [[South Gate Pass]]. Introduce yourself to Pilot Hammerfoot once you arrive.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||35}} (or {{cost|||60}} at max level)

== Completion ==
You don't know how glad I am to see fresh faces from Ironforge. Perhaps sending {{NPC||Mountaineer Barleybrew}} wasn't a waste after all.

== Notes ==
Thus begins the [[Loch Modan storyline]]. Speak to Gryh Thurden on the east side of the ring of the Great Forge:
:The [[Wildhammer clan|Wildhammer dwarves]] might have fast steeds, but can those [[Aerie Peak]] gryphons stand the heat of The Great Forge? I think not!
{{gossip|''Mountaineer Barleybrew said you could help me get to Loch Modan.''}}

The gryphon takes players on a one-way trip to the South Gate Pass at Loch Modan's border with [[Dun Morogh]] and lands immediately in front of Pilot Hammerfoot.
