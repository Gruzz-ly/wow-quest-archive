== Objectives ==
Return the [[Explorers' League]] Document to {{NPC||Torren Squarejaw}} in [[Thelsamar]].

== Description ==
The document bears the Explorer's League crest and contains historical records for all the notable locations in [[Loch Modan]]. Sooty smudges lead you to believe it was likely stolen by the the dark iron spies in the area.

You recall mention of missing documents at the Explorer's League building in [[Thelsamar]].

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||16}}

== Completion ==
Our historical records! The thought of dark iron vermin delving into our past just made me sick to my stomach.

We appreciate you bringing this back to us. We'd like to offer you some coin as a reward.

== Notes ==
This stolen document can be found southeast of Huldar and Miran, who players ran in to during a dark iron ambush during [[Resupplying the Excavation]]. Head up the hill to {{NPC||Shanda the Spinner}}'s cave. The document can thankfully be found just outside. Before heading back to Thelsamar to turn in, keep questing along the [[Ironband's Excavation Site]] storyline, as the fourth document is in the dig.

See [[Gorick's Stash List]] for the locations of the other five.

==Progression==
{{Loch Modan storyline}}
