== Objectives ==
Collect the head of {{NPC||Foreman Sharpsneer}}.
*[[Foreman Sharpsneer's Head]]

== Description ==
{{NPC||Scout Dorli||Dorli's}} filled me in on this crazy [[trogg]]-slave operation the [[kobold]]s have going, and if you haven't talked to her about it yet, I suggest you do.

I'd like to get to the bottom of this. Literally! Whoever's running this show is bound to be at the bottom of the [[Silver Stream Mine|mine]], calling the shots, and I want them dealt with.

Find whatever crafty bugger is directing the geomancers and diggers and bring me back their head.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}} (or {{cost||7|20}} at max level)

== Progress ==
I don't suppose it was {{NPC||Moira Thaurissan||Moira}} down there? Miracles do happen.

== Completion ==
That's a [[gnoll]] head. Are you trying to pull some funny business, <name>?

If you're not, I've not the faintest idea what's going on here.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Filthy Paws]] and [[A Nasty Exploit]] before heading out.

Back to the mine, but this time, heading into the mine itself! Go killing geomancers, looting gear and getting to Foreman Sharpsneer, found at {{co|34.7|26.8|Loch Modan}} all the way at the southern end of the mine.
