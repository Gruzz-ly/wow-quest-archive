==Objectives==
Protect [[Huldar]] and the Ironband Caravan, and then inform [[Prospector Ironband]].
* Protect the Ironband Caravan

==Description==
We need to get this powder to Ironband, but this cart isn't going anywhere now. It'll be a lot for us to carry, and these parts can get dangerous -- and who knows what else the Dark Irons might have in store for us now that [[Saean]] is with them.

I'll feel a lot better if you helped me watch over things. [[Miran]] can offload the powder kegs at camp while you and I protect the cart.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ironband Legguards
|Foreman Gloves
|Dastardly Bracers
|Foreman Handguards
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost||5|65}}
* 930 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
I'm glad to finally have my powder!  We're on top of some amazing discoveries.

==Completion==
It is troubling news that you bring. To think that the Dark Irons have sympathizers able to procure this sort of material for their dastardly plans.

That's a matter for someone else to consider, some other time. Thank you for protecting Huldar and the cart!

==Notes==
An escort quest! Protect the shipment. Kill the Dark Irons.

On acceptance:
:{{text|say|Miran|I'm off.  Stay safe - I'll be back as quickly as I'm able.}}
:{{text|say|Huldar|I appreciate your help in this.  We never would have suspected Saean as a sympathizer - we just weren't prepared for this.}}
:''Two [[Dark Iron Ambusher]]s approach.''
:{{text|yell|Dark Iron Ambusher|We have need of your explosives.  I'll take pleasure in killing you for them.}}
:''The PC and Huldar kill the ambushers.  Another ambusher appears, accompanied by Saean.''
:{{text|say|Saean|Sorry, Huldar... But it seems I've misled you.}}
:''The PC and Huldar kill the other ambusher and Saean.''
:{{text|say|Huldar|Good work!  I'm glad to see some revenge taken on that traitor.  Go ahead and take the path Miran did to the east and let Prospector Ironband know we're all set.  I'm sure he'll have some work for you as well.}}
