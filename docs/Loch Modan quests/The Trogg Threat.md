==Objectives==
Collect 8 Trogg Stone Teeth.
*[[Trogg Stone Tooth]] x8

==Description==
<class>, you may or may not be aware of the [[trogg]] threat looming over [[Khaz Modan|dwarven lands]]. With the [[Ironforge Reserve]] called up to the Alliance Front, we're left with a fraction of the defense forces needed to keep these lands safe. My regiment is assigned to watch over the town here and we cannot leave our post for fear of invasion.

But we need some pressure put on those damned troggs lurking in the hills. If you're up to the task, wage an assault on the troggs. Bring me back eight trogg stone teeth as proof.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||5}} (or {{cost||7|20}} at max level)

==Progress==
Do you have eight trogg stone teeth to show me? If not, there is still work to be done, <name>.

==Completion==
I am quite impressed, <name>. You have done the Dwarven race a great favor by defending our lands. {{NPC||Magni Bronzebeard||King Magni Bronzebeard}} himself would be proud!

==Notes==
Pick up [[In Defense of the King's Lands]] before heading out. Head northwest between the two statues and take the first right to enter [[Stonesplinter Valley]], trogg country. Then go on a genocidal rampage.
