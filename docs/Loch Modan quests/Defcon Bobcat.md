==Objectives==
Kill 8 Bobcats.
*[[Bobcat]] slain (8)

==Description==
Stop everything!  It's come to my attention that there's been bobcat sightings near the lodge.  Bobcats!

Now mind you, I've never seen a bobcat, but they're surely dangerous.  They're like mountain lions or something.  I don't want anyone leaving until the area is secure!

Anyone but you, that is.  I'll pay you to help secure the area, <class>.  But don't get your face ripped off.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1450 [[XP]] (or {{cost||9}} at level 85)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
I'm not ready to downgrade the situation just yet.  you make sure those enormous, feral beasts are dealt with.

==Completion==
Okay, yes.  I have already been informed that bobcats are much smaller than I was assuming.  But that's still pretty dangerous for gnomes!

You've done a good thing for the safety of the lodge, <name>!

==Trivia==
*{{wplink|Bobcat}}s are more closely related to the lynx family than mountain lions (cougars).
*This quest was based on a bobcat invading the Blizzard parking lot, according to [[Jeremy Feasel]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/464923833724444672 Jeremy Feasel on Twitter]: "Fun fact: The quest Defcon  Bobcat in Loch M. was based on a bobcat invading the Blizz lot, major alarm 'till we found out bobcats are cute"</ref>
