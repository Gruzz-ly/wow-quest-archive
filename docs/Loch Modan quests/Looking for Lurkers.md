== Objectives ==
Kill 8 Forest Lurkers.
*[[Forest Lurker]] slain x8

== Description ==
I don't know about you, but I'm not much a fan of [[spider]]s, much less the kind that come bigger than me. [[Loch Modan]]'s a gorgeous place, but I'd say it could do without those horrid things waltzing around.

Tell you what, I've got some spare coin, and you look like a tough one. If you head out and off some of those things for me, I'll pay you for your time.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

== Progress ==
And don't bother bringing any of the parts back. I'll trust you. I don't need to see any disgusting spider-bits.

== Completion ==
I'll rest easier knowing one of those lumbering things won't be wandering into my bedroom at night... again.  Thanks much.

== Notes ==
Pick this quest up before heading out for [[Out of Gnoll-where]] and [[WANTED: The Dark Iron Spy]]. Spiders are everywhere. Go kill a few.

==Progression==
{{Loch Modan storyline}}

== Patch changes ==
