==Objectives==
Destroy the [[Twilight Landshaper]] at the center of the Twilight's Hammer Camp.

==Description==
Look at them. The Twilight's Hammer ruined this land!

That cult caused this Cataclysm, and broke the [[Stonewrought Dam]], and drained the entire Loch. And now they wander around the ruins like it's their home!

If there was any justice in this world, someone would march into their camp and break that artifact of theirs in half. But I'm too weak to even try it.

And nobody else is brave enough either! Not even you! You see? It's all so stupid...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{coppercost|1000}} (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*1700 [[XP]] (or {{coppercost|1020}} at max level)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
See what I mean? You don't even care either.

==Completion==
You did it? You did! You fought them and won!

There's hope after all... 

==Notes==
The landshaper is a complex mechanical thing in the center of the camp.  Rotating wheel, balls of fire, mystic power source, you can't miss it.  Bust it up and call it a day.
