Collect 8 Bear Rumps from [[Black Bear (Loch Modan)|Black Bears]] in [[Loch Modan]].
* [[Bear Rump]] (8)

==Description==
There's never a shortage of empty bellies here in [[Thelsamar]], kids running in and out, workers from the excavation coming in after a hard day's work. We're famous for our blood sausages, I don't suppose you've ever tried them?

No? Well, around here you've got to work for your meals, and don't think just because you're a fancy <class>, you'll be any exception.

You get me some fresh bear rumps and leave the cooking to me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||5|}}
* 2,690 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
I'm all ready to start cooking, do you have the bear meat for me?

==Completion==
Much obliged! The rump's part of my own secret twist on the recipe... but here's instructions on how to make it with any kind of bear meat.

And here's a fresh batch of me own. Mind you eat them fresh!
