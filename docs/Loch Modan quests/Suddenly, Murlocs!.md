== Objectives ==
Speak with {{NPC||Cannary Caskshot}}.

== Description ==
So we've got [[trogg]]s working for [[kobold]]s, and kobolds working for [[gnoll]]s. The gnolls must've moved in from the Wetlands.

How do I know? Well, they brought friends, because what's left of [[the Loch]] is swarming with [[Bluegill tribe|Bluegill murlocs]] that were never there before.

Pests are pests, but this coordination is worrying. I need you to talk to Cannary Caskshot. She's one of the best hunters in these parts, and she'll know how to handle murlocs, if you can pull her away from her mug long enough.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}}

== Completion ==
Murlocs? Sure, I've hunted murlocs.

And every single stinkin' one of them deserved what they got! You hear me?

== Notes ==
Into the [[Stoutlager Inn]].
