== Objectives ==
Slay 5 Tunnel Rat Geomancers.
* [[Tunnel Rat Geomancer]] slain x5

== Description ==
I've found out what those [[kobold|rats]] are up to. There's so many of them outside because they've got [[trogg]]s digging for them in the [[Silver Stream Mine|mine]]!

The tunnel rat geomancers figured out some kind of parlor trick to control the troggs, as creatures of the earth or somesuch.

Fascinating, but not something we want to let them practice. Take out those geomancers right away.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||6}} (or {{cost||7|20}} at max level)

== Progress ==
I'm flattered you want to stay here and sweet-talk me, but we've got business.

== Completion ==
I'm sure that only worked because the troggs aren't bright to begin with. But then again, us [[dwarf|dwarves]] were once [[earthen|creatures of the earth]] as well.

Being bossed around by a kobold doesn't sound quite dignified, and I'm glad we didn't get to find out if they could pull that off.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Who's In Charge Here?]] and [[Filthy Paws]] before heading out.

Back to the mine, but this time, heading into the mine itself! Go killing geomancers, looting gear and getting to Foreman Sharpsneer, found at {{co|34.7|26.8|Loch Modan}} all the way at the southern end of the mine.

Geomancers are yelling at their slaves as players progress through the mine:
*{{text|say|Tunnel Rat Geomancer|Rock-mans dig or kobold hit more!}}
*{{text|say|Tunnel Rat Geomancer|Rock-mans lazy! Why rock-mans so lazy?!}}
*{{text|say|Tunnel Rat Geomancer|Nasty rock-mans! Do as we say!}}
*{{text|say|Tunnel Rat Geomancer|Dig ore! Rock-mans dig ore now!}}
*{{text|say|Tunnel Rat Geomancer|Dig faster!  Faster!  No stop!}}
*{{text|say|Tunnel Rat Geomancer|Dig!  Rock-mans!  For everlasting peace!}}
