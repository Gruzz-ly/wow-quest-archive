== Objectives ==
{{questportrait|Gorick Guzzledraught.jpg|Gorick Guzzledraught|Find and slay this cretin!}}
Slay Gorick Guzzledraught.
* [[Gorick Guzzledraught]] slain

== Description ==
A [[Dark Iron clan|dark iron]] spy has infiltrated [[Thelsamar|the town]], stolen documents from the Explorer's League establishment, and is now in hiding somewhere nearby. He was last sighted near the top of the hill to the south of town.

A sizable reward awaits anyone who can bring this spy to justice. Dead or alive - dead preferred.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||10}}

== Progress ==
<Magistrate Bluntnose looks at you expectantly.>

== Completion ==
You brought that damned spy to justice! This is good news. We can all rest a little bit easier, not worrying about that one.

== Notes ==
There is a path on the east side of the hill that leads to a cave up top. Just inside the cave at {{co|36.7|61.1|Loch Modan}} is both Gorick Guzzledraught and the [[Stolen Explorers' League Document]]. Gorick is a level 12 dark iron dwarf with 494 health, a Drunken Haze ability, and Fan of Knives.

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Gorick Guzzledraught|Managed to find me, eh? No matter, you won't live to tell anyone of it!}}

Kill him, loot [[Gorick's Stash List]], and interact with the scroll before heading back to town. The stash list defines the six locations that Dark Iron couriers check around Loch Modan for stolen documents, including the one where Gorick was hiding out.
