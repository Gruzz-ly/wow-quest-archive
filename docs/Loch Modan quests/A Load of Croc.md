== Objectives ==
Collect 6 Crocolisk Jaws.
*[[Intact Crocolisk Jaw]] x6

== Description ==
Now while you're runnin' around doin' whatever the heck it is that you do, would you mind helpin' me out a bit?

See, I usually go out huntin' [[crocolisk]]s down in [[The Loch|the loch]], but given certain circumstances, I'd rather sit here right now. Mighty polite of you not to give me grief over it, thanks!

So seein' as how you're such a <gentleman/lady>, why don't you bring me back some crocolisk jaws and I'll give you some mostly-clean money in return.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||7}} (or {{cost||8|40}} at max level)

== Progress ==
So did you get those crocolisk things or did I make that up?

== Completion ==
Mighty kind of you to help out an ol' fool like me. Here's your reward as promised an' all.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Smells Like A Plan]] and [[Buzz Off]] before heading out. Since players are near the Loch, remember that [[Gorick's Stash List]] mentions the fishing dock near Thelsamar. The stolen document can be found just to the northeast of Cannary at {{co|41.4|39.0|Loch Modan}} by the old waterline. Collect it and pick up [[Explorers' League Document (2 of 6)]] before heading back to Stoutlager.

Head east, down into the loch and start killing. Murlocs are along the loch's west coast, while the crocolisks and buzzards are down to the south.

While at the southern end of what's left of the loch, note the {{NPC||Mosshide Representative}} at {{co|50.6|56.1|Loch Modan}} speaking to a few {{NPC||Bluegill Representative}}s with a {{NPC||Tunnel Rat Lackey}} in attendance. Maybe there is some truth to the rumors.
