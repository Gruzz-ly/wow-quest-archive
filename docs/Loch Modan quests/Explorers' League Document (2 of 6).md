== Objectives ==
Return the [[Explorers' League]] Document to {{NPC||Torren Squarejaw}} in [[Thelsamar]].

== Description ==
The document bears the Explorer's League crest and seems to detail potential dig sites in [[Loch Modan]]. Sooty smudges lead you to believe it was likely stolen by the the dark iron spies in the area.

You recall mention of missing documents at the Explorer's League building in Thelsamar.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||16}}

== Completion ==
Well look at that. You found one of our stolen documents!

We're much obliged for it's return. Hopefully a bit of gold will suit your fancy for the finders fee?

== Notes ==
This document can be found at the fishing dock near the old waterline of [[the Loch]] just outside of Thelsamar. See [[Gorick's Stash List]] for the locations of the other five.
