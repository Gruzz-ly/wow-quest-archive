==Objectives==
Kill {{NPC||Mangeclaw}}.

Bring his Mangy Claw and Hildelve's Journal to {{NPC||Pilot Hammerfoot}} at the [[South Gate Outpost]].
*[[Mangy Claw]]
*[[Hildelve's Journal]] (provided)

== Description ==
Hildelve wrote in his journal that he was attacked by Mangeclaw, a "huge [[Ice Claw Bear]]." He drove off the beast, but not before it mauled him savagely.

Judging from the state of Hildelve's body, Mangeclaw must have later returned and killed him.

However, Hildelve wrote in his journal his one, final wish:

Revenge against Mangeclaw.

("Mangeclaw: Look around Hildelve's body. The bear will certainly be nearby.")

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Mangy Claw Mitts

== Progress ==
Hello, <name>.  Do you have word of my friend Hildelve?

== Completion ==
This is grim news, for Hildelve was a good friend. And I wish I could have been there with you when you found the beast, Mangeclaw!

Thank you, <name>. Your deed will be remembered by the pilots of the [[Ironforge Siege Brigade]].

== Notes ==
On accept, Mangeclaw comes down from the hill north of the dwarven corpse.
:{{text|emote|Mangeclaw roars a challenge!}}
Mangeclaw is a level 11 bear with 289 health. Kill him, then return through the [[South Gate Pass]] back to the outpost, and Hammerfoot.
