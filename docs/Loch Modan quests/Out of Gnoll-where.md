== Objectives ==
Collect 12 Gnoll Ears from {{NPC||Mosshide Scout}}s or {{NPC||Mosshide Basher}}s.
*[[Mosshide Ear]] x12

== Description ==
Well met, <class>. We've got a problem, and I'd ask you to lend a hand.

It's [[gnoll]]s. There's a mess of the things west of [[Thelsamar|town]], roaming the hills. Not usually any cause for alarm, but we've not usually had gnolls here in [[Loch Modan]].

I'm curious where they came from, but not curious enough to bother asking the mangy things. Clear 'em out, I say. Bring back proof of your kills and I'll pay a solid bounty.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||5}} (or {{cost||7|20}} at max level)

== Progress ==
Got some ears for me, then?

== Completion ==
Nicely done, <lad/lass>. I could use a <class> like you around here.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Looking for Lurkers]] from {{NPC||Dakk Blunderblast}}, in the northern part of town before heading out. Also available is a wanted quest, [[WANTED: The Dark Iron Spy]] available from a billboard near Kadrell.

The gnolls are swarming an unnamed camp west of Thelsamar. Go kill them and loot their ears. Make sure to kill spiders along the way there, and also south to [[Grizzlepaw Ridge]], which is where {{NPC||Gorick Guzzledraught}} can be found for the wanted quest. An Explorers' League Document can be found at his feet, and he drops a book containing the locations of the other five. Return to Thelsamar after killing Gorick and picking up [[Explorers' League Document (1 of 6)]].
