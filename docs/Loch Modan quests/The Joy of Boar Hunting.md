== Objectives ==
Kill 10 Mudbelly Boars
* [[Mudbelly Boar]] slain (10)

==  Description ==
Try to contain your excitement, <name>, for you are in the presence of the greatest boar hunter in [[Azeroth]]!

Their cunning intellect, rapid speed, ferocious strength, and resilient hide... yes, boards are the quarry of only the most masterful of hunters.  Amateurs need not apply!

Why, I bet you've never even hunted such an exotic beast.  I'll bet silver any day that you can't match my record of ten boars killed.  Try the ones on the eastern shore of the lock... but don't hurt yourself now, rookie.

== Progress ==
It's okay, <name>.  It happens to a lot of <class>s.  Being unable to live up to my greatness is nothing to be ashamed of.

==  Completion ==
You've killed ten already?  H...hah!  While you were out, I've broken my previous record!  To ten... hundred!  yes, ten hundred boars!

A bet is a bet, I suppose... here's your consolation prize, <name>!
