==Objectives==
Find [[Grumnus Steelshaper]] in [[Loch Modan]].

==Description==
The armor may be shattered, but there's still hope. With the [[Fragments of Shattered Armor|fragments]] you found, we might be able to forge it anew.

This is far outside my area of expertise, but there may be someone who can help. We should speak with [[Grumnus Steelshaper]]. He retired to [[Thelsamar]] in [[Loch Modan]].

Go on ahead, I'll meet you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Brann]] filled me in on what happened. This tablet will certainly help guide us.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Legend has it that when a mountain king's armor is forged, it binds tae the dwarf fer whom it was made.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|These shards are all that remain.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Reforging an historic piece of armor like this will be no easy task. But with Grumnus's guidance, it might just be possible.}}

Take the Griffon to [[Thelsamar]] and head to [[Stoutlager Inn]] where [[Brann Bronzebeard]] and [[Grumnus Steelshaper]] are talking.
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|As ye can see, the armor's completely shattered... Ah! Here's our friend now!}}
:{{text|say|Grumnus Steelshaper|I'm not sure we can reforge the armor, Brann. The Great Forge would need tae be much hotter than any of us have ever seen.}}
:{{text|say|Grumnus Steelshaper|Even if we could smelt the metal, no dwarf can endure that kind o' heat. Not even a Dark Iron!}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Don't worry, Grumnus. Some friends o' mine may be able tae help us solve both of those problems.}}

==Progression==
