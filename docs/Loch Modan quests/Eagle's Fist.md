==Objectives==
Water spray dampens the air, the view is incredible.

==Description==
You find a carefully folded letter inside of the toolbox. Imagining a voice speaking, you read: "From here, with the right tools, you call the shots. Great place to launch a parachute glider.

My loyalty to the [[Stromgarde (kingdom)|Eagle and Fist]] requires distance in order to serve them best. This [[Thoradin's Wall|barricade]] has had better days, like the Old Kingdoms it once defended, but I'll never abandon it."

*3150 [[XP]]
*{{cost||50}}

==Completion==
A campfire is newly fed with wood, but signs of a quick departure are evident.
