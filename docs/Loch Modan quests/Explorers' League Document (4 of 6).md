== Objectives ==
Return the [[Explorers' League]] Document to {{NPC||Torren Squarejaw}} in [[Thelsamar]].

== Description ==
The document bears the Explorer's League crest and seems to detail transport routes utilized by the league into and out of Loch Modan. Sooty smudges lead you to believe it was likely stolen by the the dark iron spies in the area.

You recall mention of missing documents at the Explorer's League building in Thelsamar.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||16}}

== Completion ==
Ug, I can't believe they got their hands on our transport routes - that was just asking for trouble!!

Thank you for getting this back to us before they were able to do much with it! You probably saved us a lot of heartache. Please accept some coin as a reward for your efforts.

== Notes ==
This document can be found inside [[Ironband's Excavation Site]], while players are there for [[Keep Your Hands Off The Goods!]].

See [[Gorick's Stash List]] for the locations of the other five.
