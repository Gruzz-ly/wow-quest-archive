== Objectives ==
Collect 7 Murloc Scent Glands from any [[Bluegill tribe|Bluegill Murloc]] in [[The Loch]].
*[[Murloc Scent Gland]] x7

== Description ==
[[Murloc]]s workin' with [[gnoll]]s? That's a laugh! Now, just killin' them won't get you anywhere. Too many of the buggers.

But I've got a plan, usin' the old noggin, see. Those murlocs, they have this smell, they get that smell on stuff, and when another murloc smells it, they go all crazy! Makes great bait for 'em.

Anyway, they've got little glands that have that smell in 'em. You go and get me a bunch of those.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||14}}

== Progress ==
Now don't you stink all to high hell! I'm assumin' that's because of the murlocs, but it's hard to tell.

== Completion ==
Phew! Ain't that a stench.

Now you prepare yourself, because I'm about to wow you with what's left of my mental faculties.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[A Load of Croc]] and [[Buzz Off]] before heading out. Since players are near the Loch, remember that [[Gorick's Stash List]] mentions the fishing dock near Thelsamar. The stolen document can be found just to the northeast of Cannary at {{co|41.4|39.0|Loch Modan}} by the old waterline. Collect it and pick up [[Explorers' League Document (2 of 6)]] before heading back to Stoutlager.

Head east, down into the loch and start killing. Murlocs are along the loch's west coast, while the crocolisks and buzzards are down to the south.

While at the southern end of what's left of the loch, note the {{NPC||Mosshide Representative}} at {{co|50.6|56.1|Loch Modan}} speaking to a few {{NPC||Bluegill Representative}}s with a {{NPC||Tunnel Rat Lackey}} in attendance. Maybe there is some truth to the rumors.
