== Objectives ==
Deliver {{NPC||Pilot Hammerfoot}}'s Status Report to {{NPC||Captain Rugelfuss}} in the [[Valley of Kings]].
*[[South Gate Status Report]] (provided)

== Description ==
We're due for sending a status report over to the mountaineers in the Valley of Kings.

I expect you're on your way there next anyhow - would you mind dropping it off for me? Just take the tunnel to the east, and check in at the guard station. Hand it directly to Captain Rugelfuss.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3}} (or {{cost||5|40}} at max level)

== Progress ==
What brings you all the way out here?

== Completion ==
The South Gate status report? Excellent. I've been awaiting news from them for a while.

With the increasing number of troggs in the hills on all sides, I fear the outposts will be the first to feel any aggressive action.

== Notes ==
Southeast through the other South Gate Pass into [[Loch Modan]] proper, then across the road and into the [[guard tower]]. Rugelfuss is on the lower floor, just inside.

==Progression==
{{Loch Modan storyline}}

== Patch changes ==
*{{Patch 4.0.3a|note=Added.}}
