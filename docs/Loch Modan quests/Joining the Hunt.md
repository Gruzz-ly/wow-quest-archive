== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Marek Ironheart]] at the [[Farstrider Lodge]].

==  Description ==
Well, you definitely have some fight in you.

You know, there are some hunter types at the lodge east of here, up in the hills - they might be right up your alley.  Why don't you go pay them a visit and see if they have any work that you might be interested in?

==  Completion ==
Hello there, <laddy/lass>!  The mountaineers sent you over, eh?  I do suspect we might have just the sort of work you're looking for.  Welcome to the Farstrider Lodge!

==  Rewards ==
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|20}} at level 85)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]
