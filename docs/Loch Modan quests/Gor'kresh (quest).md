==Objectives==

*Defeat [[Gor'kresh]].

==Description==
The ogre left to watch over these crude fools goes by the name of Gor'kresh. He's big enough to boss even these brutes around, and cunning to boot. Never assume an ogre's stupid, that's when they'll get you.

If you take him out, we'll show the Twilight's Hammer that Loch Modan isn't a stepping stone for them. Stand strong against Gor'kresh and drive these fools back into the highlands!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost||30}}
*2,200 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Ironforge (faction)|Ironforge]]

==Progress==
You can do it, <name>.

==Completion==
You've done it! We may not have stopped the cult dead, but we've shown them we're not easy pickings and given them a welt to prove it.

Take this with my gratitude, and try not to blush if anyone in Thelsamar calls you "hero"!

==Patch changes==
