==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Pilot Hammerfoot}} at [[South Gate Outpost]] in [[Loch Modan]].

==Description==
By order of his royal highness, {{NPC||Varian Wrynn||King Varian Wrynn}}, all able-bodied citizens of the [[Alliance]] are to report to Pilot Hammerfoot at South Gate Outpost.

The destruction of the [[Stonewrought Dam]] and the resurgence of the [[kobold]]s and [[trogg]]s has the [[mountaineer]]s stretched thin. Reinforcements are desperately needed! Travel east through [[South Gate Pass]] from eastern [[Dun Morogh]] to reach South Gate Outpost.

For the glory and honor of the Alliance! 

==Completion==
Have our leaders finally heard my pleas?  We're down to just a handful of pilots and mountaineers to defend Loch Modan.
