== Objectives ==
Deliver {{NPC||Captain Rugelfuss}}'s Status Report to {{NPC||Mountaineer Kadrell}} in [[Thelsamar]].

== Description ==
You've helped us quite a bit here. If you're leaving, I'd ask you to take this status report up to Thelsamar.

Follow the road just north, and you can't miss it. Mountaineer Kadrell will want the report.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||5}} (or {{cost||5|40}} at max level)

== Progress ==
What can I do for you?

== Completion ==
Glad to hear you've been clearing out the [[trogg]]s. Let's have a look at this report, and...

...Is that a beer stain?

== Notes ==
Why yes, yes it is.

Just as the captain said, follow the road north to reach Thelsamar. Make sure to pick up the flight path on the way in!
