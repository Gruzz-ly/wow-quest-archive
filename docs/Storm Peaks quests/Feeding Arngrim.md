==Objectives==
You are to feed Arngrim 5 [[Disembodied Jormungar]], then return to Arngrim's frozen image in [[Dun Niffelem]].

You must go to the [[Valley of Ancient Winters]] and use [[Arngrim's Tooth]] on the [[Roaming Jormungar]] there. Once they have become disembodied, you must fight them until they are weakened.
* Arngrim's spirit fed (5)
* [[Arngrim's Tooth]] (provided)

==Description==
Arngrim's hunger was legendary.

Even in death, his expression is one of famished yearning. You find that just looking at him is making your stomach growl.

It is said that throughout his life he was never truly sated, and that there was absolutely nothing he wouldn't eat. You wonder to yourself if there might be a way to feed the old king.

No sooner does the thought enter your mind than one of the massive frozen teeth falls from Arngrim's head, bounces off of his beard and lands in your hand.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Completion==
As you anchor the tooth in Arngrim's jaw, you get the impression that your efforts may have taken the edge off of the old king's hunger pangs... for now.

==Notes==
You can only accept this quest at {{reputation|revered}} reputation with [[The Sons of Hodir]].

HUNTERS: If your pet has aggro when the spirit spawns to eat the worm, you won't get credit.   You must have the worms aggro.

It appears that in some cases killing the worm with very few hits (2-3 shots) will prevent the spirit from spawning, as the worm does not pass through an intermediate "weakened" state before dying. If you repeatedly miss quest credit, try using attacks that do less damage per hit.
