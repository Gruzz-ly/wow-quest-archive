==Objectives==
[[Bouldercrag the Rockshaper]] at [[Bouldercrag's Refuge]] wants you to travel to [[Uldis]] and try to prevent [[Overseer Narvir]] from obtaining the Heart of the Storm.
* Try to find the [[The Heart of the Storm|Heart of the Storm]] before Overseer Narvir does

==Description==
According to the documents you captured at [[Narvir's Cradle]], the iron colossus is complete except for one key component—the Heart of the Storm.

Without it, the iron colossus' weapons would be much weaker than the design predicts. If we can deny Overseer Narvir the heart, we could defeat the colossus!

Notes on the documents you found say that the heart is in Uldis, a titan facility far to the south. Its entrance is on the south side of a tall mountain overlooking the [[Bor's Breath]] River. 

==Progress==
Tell me that the heart didn't fall into enemy hands.

==Completion==
With the heart in the hands of Narvir, the colossus will achieve its full power! We'll have no choice but to fight it.

==Notes==
The entrance to Uldis is at {{coords|32.4|63.6|Storm Peaks}} in the southern face of the [[Temple of Storms]] peak, just north of the Bor's Breath river, southeast of [[Valkyrion]].

Inside Uldis at {{coords|36.1|60.9|Storm Peaks}} is the Heart of the Storm. Use it and Narvir will cyclone the player for ~25 seconds while he loots it instead.

:Overseer Narvir says: You may have killed Valduran, but that won't stop me from completing the colossus.
