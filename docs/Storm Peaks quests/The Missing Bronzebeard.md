== Objectives ==
Retrieve the [[Burlap-Wrapped Note]] from [[Brann]]'s camp and return it to [[Boktar Bloodfury]] at the [[Grom'arsh Crash-Site]].
* [[Burlap-Wrapped Note]]

== Description ==
Before we left, I received the file [[Scout Vor'takh]] compiled on this [[Brann Bronzebeard]]. There can be no doubt that Brann was headed for the Storm Peaks from his journal entries and findings in [[Grizzly Hills]]. Before we crashed, I caught site of a campsite south of here, across the [[Foot Steppes]], and overlooking the frozen [[Bor's Breath]] River.

If Brann isn't there, search the camp and its environs for any clues as to where that blasted dwarf might've gone. Bring back anything you find. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Progress ==
Did you have any luck finding Bronzebeard's camp?

== Completion ==
Of course, with our luck, I probably could've predicted this. Well, we're not going to let him get away that easily. Let's see what that note says.

== Notes ==
Look for [[Disturbed Snow]] at {{coords|36.1|64.2|Storm Peaks}}.
