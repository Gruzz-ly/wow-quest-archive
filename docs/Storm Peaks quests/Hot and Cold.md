==Objectives==
You are to go to [[Frostfield Lake]], kill the [[Brittle Revenant]]s there and use the [[Essence of Ice]] on the [[Smoldering Scrap]]s at [[Fjorn's Anvil]]. You are then to collect 6 of the Frozen Iron scraps and return to Fjorn's Anvil in [[Dun Niffelem]].
* [[Frozen Iron Scrap]] (6)

==Description==
As you stare at the anvil you relive your recent accomplishments, particularly those which brought this artifact to rest here.

It suddenly occurs to you that more remains to be done. To the east, smoldering scraps clutter the landscape - shrapnel from the battle fought there.

If they could be cooled and gathered somehow, the frost giants would have an abundant supply of metal and the region would be cleared of these remnants of war. 

==Progress==
A luminous blue glow surrounds the anvil.

==Completion==
You feel a sense of accomplishment as you realize that your efforts continue to strengthen the renewed bonds between Thorim and the Sons of Hodir.

==Notes==
Loot the Essences of Ice from the Brittle Revenants, then head to the Fjorn's Anvil area and throw the essences at Smoldering Scraps on the ground.

Frozen Ice Scraps can be looted by any player, not just the one who froze them, which means that they are vulnerable to ninjas (this also means that a player with excess [[Essence of Ice]] can use them to freeze scraps for other players).

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 3.3.0|note=Increased number of Frozen Iron Scraps required from 5 to 6.}}
