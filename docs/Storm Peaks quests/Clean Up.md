==Objectives==
[[Jeer Sparksocket]] at [[K3]] would like 10 pieces of Charred Wreckage.
*[[Charred Wreckage]] (10)

==Description==
To the point... [[Ricket]]'s asked me to put together some stronger land mines, but I'm running low on parts.

Just west of town, you'll find the remains of our last rocket sled... Ricket got a little excited when she was fueling it, but I probably should have thought to not put the nozzle right over the exhaust. Live and learn, eh?

There should be a good stock of spare parts scattered around the destroyed sled... why don't you go ahead and chase off those scavengers and nab me some of that wreckage?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|80}}

==Progress==
We have to have something we can use to insolate our engines against this cold... think Jeer, think!

Oh hey! Did you get some of that wreckage for me?

==Completion==
These will do nicely, thanks!

Did you see [[Dim Flathoof|Dim]] out there? I sent him out a long while back and he never came back. I hope he's alright.

Speaking of which... I wonder where [[Janks]] is...
