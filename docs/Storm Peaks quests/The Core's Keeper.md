==Objectives==
Obtain Norgannon's Core, then use [[:Brann's Communicator]] to contact [[Brann Bronzebeard]].

If you lose Brann's Communicator, speak to [[Moteha Windborn]] at the [[Grom'arsh Crash-Site]] to replace it.
* [[Norgannon's Core]]

==Description==
Prospector Soren's notes say that Norgannon's Core is in the keeping of a sentinel named [[Athan]], one of [[Mimir]]'s creations.

Soren says the vault where Athan resides is called "[[Loken's Bargain]]" these days.

[[Loken]], eh? The [[Earthen]] have mentioned him.

The vault is said to be southwest of the ruined [[Explorers' League]] camp, with a round entrance on a mountainside overlooking the [[Valley of Ancient Winters]].

Find this Athan and get the core from him, but I wouldn't be surprised if you were in for a fight. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
*22050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|13|23}} at 80)

==Progress==
Was Prospector Soren right? Did you finally find Norgannon's Core?

==Completion==
This is really it! The key is almost within our grasp. All we need now is a way to combine the [[Norgannon's Shell|shell]] and the core into a single key. Let's see what Prospector Soren had to say about this...

==Notes==
The entrance to the vault is at {{coords|56.3|58.4|Storm Peaks}}. You can use your flying mount to get all the way down to the back of the vault where Athan is.
