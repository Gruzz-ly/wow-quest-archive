==Description==
The time has come, little <class>. The stars have foretold of this day.

I have received a vision from mighty Hodir himself, revealing the secret to the creation of a great artifact.

We must obey! Were we to fail in receiving this gift, doom would surely follow.

I call upon you to assist me in this sacred undertaking.

Go across the valley, deep into the Hibernal Cavern and gather everfrost shards from the icy crater there, then collect hides from the mammoths outside the cavern.

==Rewards==
The following spell will be cast on you: 
see [[Hodir's Spear]]

You will also receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
*22050 [[XP]] (of a {{cost|g=13|s=23|}} compensation at level 80)
*325 reputation with [[The Sons of Hodir]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered the materials for the spear, <race>?

==Completion==
Stand back, <race>, and behold the fulfilling of a prophecy!
