'''Making a Harness'' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Astrid Bjornrittar]] in [[Brunnhildar Village]] wants you to obtain 3 Icemane Yeti Hides.
* [[Icemane Yeti Hide]]: (3)

==Description==
So you want to ride? Well, if you've made it this far someone must think you've got a shot at the Hyldsmeet.

First things first; we'll have to make you a harness.

In the cliffs to the south, you'll find scattered groups of yeti. Their hides are tough and just the right thickness. Bring me some and we'll get you started on the path of the bear-rider. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Brunnhildar Runed Ring|Yeti Hide Mantle|Brunnhildar Snowkickers|Astrid's Riding Gloves}}

==Progress==
Did you find the hides yet? You'll find yeti in the hills below.

==Completion==
These will do nicely. I'll have the harness ready for you in no time.

==Notes==
The yeti have a crushing slam that hits for roughly 1000 and regular melee swings around 500 on cloth. Watch out!
