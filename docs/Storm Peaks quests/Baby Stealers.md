==Objectives==
[[Fjorlin Frostbrow]] at [[Frosthold]] would like you to bring back 15 Stormcrest Eagle Eggs.
* [[Stormcrest Eagle Egg]] (15)

==Description==
A few weeks ago, if you looked up, you'd see dozens of those beautiful eagles soaring the skies. Now, only a few if any. They've taken to staying with their nests nearly all the time now because the [[harpy|harpies]] have been stealing their eggs.

The harpies have grown a taste for eagle flesh, it seems... the sick wretches are caring for the eggs long enough to feast on the hatchlings. Get down there and take the eggs back... bring them back here, and I'll take them back to the nests. 

==Progress==
We'll get this harpy problem taken care of... the eagles will be free to soar the skies again soon.

==Completion==
Good stuff, lad. You're making fast friends.

If you stop back by soon, I'm sure we can find one that will let you ride... they should know that you're trustworthy now.

==Notes==
Do this quest alongside [[Stemming the Aggressors]] to save some time.
