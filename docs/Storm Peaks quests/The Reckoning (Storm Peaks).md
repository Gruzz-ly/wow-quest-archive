'''The Reckoning''' is part of [[the Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Thorim]] near the [[Temple of Wisdom]]. Report the outcome of the fight to [[King Jokkum|Jokkum]] in [[Dun Niffelem]].
* [[#Notes|Witness the Reckoning]]
* [[Horn of the Peaks]]

==Description==
[[Loken]] killed my wife, turned my followers and me against each other. He took away everything I had, but today... that changes.

Today we reclaim our sacred grounds. Today... Loken dies.

Meet me on the bridge near the Temple of Wisdom, just southwest of Ulduar. I will finish this one way or the other.

I need you there as a witness. You will not aid me -- this is personal.

After it's done, send word to Jokkum, King of the [[frost giant|Frost Giants]]. He's a good friend and will know what to do. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Gloves of the Servant|Rough Climber's Grips|Gauntlets of the Windreacher|Gauntlets of Vigilance}}

==Progress==
Ach, <name>! It's good to see you, little one.

==Completion==
No... it cannot be...

No one can defeat Thorim in single combat. Not a giant, nor a beast... no one! Especially not that coward of a brother of his.

On my forefather's names, this I swear...

Loken will pay for this!

==Notes==
[[File:The Reckoning - Thorim and Veranus.jpg|thumb|Thorim and Veranus waiting outside the Temple of Wisdom.]]
The Temple of Wisdom is just south of [[Ulduar]], north of the mainland. Thorim is standing on the bridge north of it at {{coords|35.9|31.5|Storm Peaks}} with Veranus hovering next to him.

:I've hidden from my destiny long enough. What I must do has never been clearer.

:Loken must be destroyed by my hand.

:{{gossip|I'm with you, Thorim.}}

:{{text|say|Thorim|It is time I put an end to my brother's madness.}}
:''Thorim walks up and yells in Loken's face.''
:{{text|yell|Thorim|Loken!!}}
:{{text|yell|Thorim|Stand up and fight me, you worthless traitor!}}
:''Loken knocks Thorim away, then jumps up to him.''
[[File:Thorim and Loken - The Reckoning.jpg|thumb|Loken and Thorim.]]
:{{text|say|Loken|You seem eager to join your beloved Sif, brother.}}
:''Thorim unleashes a flurry of attacks, knocking Loken back towards the center of the temple.''
:{{text|say|Thorim|Do not dare...}}
:{{text|say|Thorim|Speak...}}
:{{text|say|Thorim|Her name!!}}
:{{text|yell|Loken|ENOUGH!}}
:{{text|say|Loken|Looks like you can still best me in a fair fight, little brother.}}
:{{text|say|Loken|Unfortunately for you.... this fight is anything but fair!}}
:''Loken incapacitates Thorim with a beam of some sort, trapping him under two translucent tentacles, and summons two Runeforged Servants.''

:{{text|say|Loken|Thanks to your little friend, you've left the [[Temple of Storms]], where you were at your strongest. Instead we fight closer to {{NPC||Yogg-Saron||my master's}} power.}}
:{{text|say|Loken|Minions! Take my brother and [[Veranus|his drake]] to their new dwellings. Make sure the beast makes it alive. I have [[Razorscale|special plans]] for the broodmother.}}
:{{text|say|Loken|As for your life, mortal. I will be generous. After all... why would I destroy my most useful servant? {{NPC||Lok'lira the Crone||I waited for you}} for weeks inside that [[Hyldnir]] [[Forlorn Mine|mine]].}}
:{{text|say|Loken|The shape wasn't mine, of course. And had you not been so reckless, you would've seen past my illusion. But you came through for me, and for that... I must thank you!}}
:''Loken, Thorim and the remainder of the NPCs teleport away.''
