==Objectives==
Escort the [[Injured Goblin Miner]] out of [[Crystalweb Cavern]] and then speak to [[Ricket]] at [[K3]].
* Escort the Injured Goblin Miner to K3.

==Description==
Oi - thank you! I thought for sure I'd just be a spider snack. Perhaps I'm speaking a bit soon though - let's get the heck out of here!

Let me know as soon as you're ready to go... make it quick. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Snowblind Butcher|Garm's Ward|Daschal's Serrated Blade|Twisted Reflection}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|6|80}}
*21,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I take it that things went well at the cavern? Was Tore decent to you?

==Completion==
Thanks for helping out our miner back there, <name>! I should be able to put together an antidote no problem.

If you stumble into [[Tore Rumblewrench|Tore]] again, tell her that she's a jerk for me, will ya?

==Notes==
The Goblin Miner runs, not walks, so make sure the path is clear and you're fully healed before telling him you're ready to go.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Injured Goblin Miner|Let me know when you're ready. I'd prefer sooner than later... what with the slowly dying from poison and all.}}

On reaching the mouth of the cave:
:{{text|say|Injured Goblin Miner|I'm going to bring the venom sac to Ricket... and then... you know... collapse. Thank you for helping me!}}
