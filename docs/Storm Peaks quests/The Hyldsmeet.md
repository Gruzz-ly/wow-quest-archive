'''The Hyldsmeet''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Listen to [[Lok'lira the Crone]]'s proposal.
* Listen to Lok'lira's proposal

==Description==
Whether you've noticed or not, by defeating your first [[Hyldnir]] in hand-to-hand combat, you've entered the Hyldsmeet -- the great competition of Hyldnir against Hyldnir to determine who will rule by Thorim's side.

The Hyldsmeet is the reason why I was imprisoned, for I sought to partake in the competition but was far too old and frail to be a match for the Hyldnir.

If you're willing to listen, I've a proposal for you. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||74}}

==Progress==
Keep it down, the others might start getting suspicious.

==Completion==
It's settled then. You will compete in the Hyldsmeet and with my help you're restore the great Thorim to his rightful place.

==Notes==
:Look at them... all they care about is outdoing each other.
{{gossip|''Tell me about this proposal.''}}
:You see, [[Thorim]] is not like these harpies. He's a worthy being of near godlike stature.
:He served the [[titan]]s as a guardian of [[Ulduar]] and the [[Terrace of the Makers]].
:That is, until his wife, Sif, was cowardly slain by his brother.
{{gossip|''What happened then?''}}
:Thorim lost it. He lashed out against his most beloved allies, the [[frost giant]]s.
:That's one reason why to this day, this land is torn apart by the war between the [[Hyldnir]] and the [[Sons of Hodir]]... and why Thorim has exiled himself to the [[Temple of Storms]].
{{gossip|''You want me to take part in the Hyldsmeet to end the war?''}}
:What do I care if these she-wolves and the frost giants kill each other every day?
:No, no... I want Thorim to break out of his stupor and rally all his allies to retake Ulduar.
:The world will be torn asunder if he fails to accomplish this!
:And of course, I'll reward you appropriately.
{{gossip|''Very well. I'll take part in this competition.''}}
