==Objectives==
Speak to [[Jeer Sparksocket]] at [[K3]] in the [[Storm Peaks]]

==Description==
Hey there, pal!

Do you like excitement and explosions! Who doesn't? I've know just the place for you. Down at luxurious K3, they're always making innovative inventions and finding all-new ways to make things blow up! Sounds thrilling, doesn't it? If you want to be part of the fun, head on down today and speak to Jeer Sparksprocket.

Mandatory disclaimer: manual labor may be required to partake in previous indicated "excitement."

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||68}}

==Completion==
Welcome to K3!

We came here to make our way into those peaks and get our fair share of some of those amazing [[titan]] machines. Progress on that end has been somewhat minimal, though. [[Gnoll]]s, [[snobold]]s, [[magnataur]]... there's no shortage of trouble to go around.

No to mention, we can't seem to keep any fliers in the air without their motors freezing.

There's plenty of work to be done though - lend a hand, eh?

==Notes==
A lead-in to the Storm Peaks from the [[Underbelly]] of [[Dalaran]].
