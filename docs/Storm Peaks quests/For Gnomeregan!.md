==Objectives==
Enter the Halls of Stone and defeat [[Telzo Sparkspanner]].
* Enter the [[Halls of Stone]]
* [[Smasher X900]] slain

==Description==
It's time to bring down Sparkspanner, Commander.

Just give me the word, and I'll turn [[First Squadron Prototype|this machine]] straight towards the Halls of Stone!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Sparkspanner needs to be defeated, for the sake of all [[Gnome|Gnomanity]].{{Sic}}

==Completion==
Is everyone alright? [[Fizzi Tinkerbow|Our tinker]] can set up a Medic Bot if necessary.

==Notes==
[[File:WorldMap-Ulduar77.jpg|thumb|Map of the Halls of Stone]]
On accept, the [[First Squadron Prototype]] is immediately hit with a bolt of energy from the nearest [[Aerial Defense Unit]], setting one of the wings on fire. Winklespring quickly maneuvers the plane into the entrance of the Halls of Stone.
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|We've been hit! Hold onto something! This is going to be a bumpy landing!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Fizzi Tinkerbow]]|Evasive maneuvers, Captain! {{Wp|Star Fox|Do a barrel roll!}}}}

The burning plane enters the [[Hall of the High Father]], crash-lands, and explodes. Two [[Ironbound Brute]]s appear. One is killed when the plane explodes, while the other chases after the unscathed Winklespring, who ignores the brute and runs north toward the [[Forge of Wills]]. The two of them both subsequently despawn. Tinkerbow and [[Emaedi Autoblast|Autoblast]] arrive in the Hall of the High Father just after Winklespring, safely landing in the other First Squadron Prototype before disembarking and following Winklespring to the Forge of Wills.

(Note that if you've exited the First Squadron Prototype before accepting this quest, you will have to pick it up from Winklespring on the [[Terrace of the Makers]]{{Coords|37.6|60.2|Storm Peaks}} and then fly to the Halls of Stone on your own. If this is done, Winklespring and the player's plane will not appear upon first entering the halls, whereas Tinkerbow and Autoblast's will appear as normal.)

The paths leading to the other parts of the Halls of Stone have been sealed with huge doors, so there is no choice for you but to follow the other members of G.E.A.R. to the Forge of Wills, where Telzo Sparkspanner is waiting for you, piloting a [[clockwork giant]] called the [[Smasher X900]]. Upon aggroing the construct:
:{{Text|yell|Fizzi Tinkerbow|For [[Gnomeregan]]!}}
:{{Text|yell|Cog Captain Winklespring|For Gnomeregan!}}
:{{Text|yell|Telzo Sparkspanner|Behold true gnomish ingenuity!}}

While Telzo engages Winklespring and the player in combat, Autoblast, Tinkerbow, and G.H.O.S.T. take up positions to hold off waves of Ironbound Brutes that spawn from the western and eastern side forges — Autoblast handles the western side while Tinkerbow and her mount defend the eastern side. The Ironbound Brutes are not attackable by the player either way, so focus your attention on the Smasher X900. When the construct uses its abilities, Telzo will spout certain quotes:

;Conductivity
:{{Text|yell|Telzo Sparkspanner|Be mindful of your conduct!}}

;Defensive Position
:{{Text|yell|Telzo Sparkspanner|I'm acting in self-defense!}}

;Static Discharge
:{{Text|yell|Telzo Sparkspanner|This'll leave you ex-static!}}

Avoid the waves of energy from Conductivity—the smasher's most hard-hitting ability—and position yourself behind it when it uses Defensive Position. Upon bringing the smasher to 0% health, Telzo ejects and lands on the floor in front of the giant while it begins falling apart behind him.
:{{Text|yell|Telzo Sparkspanner|You fools! The [[titan]] defenses are already under my control! The loss of my mech means nothing! You will--}}
:''The smasher's torso falls on top of Telzo, crushing him.''
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|Target neutralized! [[Captain Tread Sparknozzle|Sparknozzle]] will want a full report, Commander. We'll clean up here.}}

Talk to Winklespring to turn in.

If the player is killed, they will automatically respawn at the entrance to the Hall of the High Father upon [[Release Spirit|releasing spirit]]. It is also possible to manually run out of the dungeon, but doing so will cause all of the NPCs to reset and force the player to complete the battle with Telzo again when they re-enter the dungeon.
