==Objectives==
[[Fjorlin Frostbrow]] at [[Frosthold]] wants you to ride with a [[Stormcrest Eagle]] and kill 16 Stormpeak Wyrms in the [[Foot Steppes]].
* [[Stormpeak Wyrm]] slain (16)
* [[Storm Hammer]] (provided)

==Description==
You [[The Reckoning (Storm Peaks)|were there]] with [[Loken]], weren't you? The [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] captured [[Veranus]], the brood mother of the [[proto-dragon|proto-drakes]]. The drakes don't seem even a little bit happy about the situation... they've gotten very aggressive.

They've pushed into stormcrest territory and the eagles have taken to an all out fight with them. It's time to return the favor. We're riding to the Foot Steppes and slaughtering them there.

[[Yorg Stormheart|King Stormheart]] left this hammer to me - make good use and see to it that I get it back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|96|}} (At level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with the [[Frostborn]]

==Progress==
This is completely out of control.

==Completion==
I don't see the drakes being dissuaded so easily. Stop back by tomorrow if you think you can spare more time to help.

==Notes==
If you are dismounted, you can return to the quest giver for a new eagle:
:{{gossip|I am ready to join the battle against the wyrms. Do you have an eagle ready for me, Fjorlin?}}

Controls while on the eagle: #1 is Swoop, doing 3.5-4000 damage, 10 yard range, #2 is Eye Gouge, doing 3.5-4000 damage a second every second while channeling (for 10 seconds), on a 30 second cooldown, #3 is Storm Bolt (hammer icon), doing 5500-6500 damage and stunning for 4 seconds, 1 second cast, 6 second cooldown.

Get in range of a drake and use #3 (Storm Bolt) to stun it and close to 10 yards, then spam 1 until it dies. The storm bolt can be cast while moving.

If you start attacking only with melee, by right-clicking on a wyrm, even if you finish it with the controls it will become lootable, which is great for [[Skinning|skinners]].

If you happen to be level 85, it will be faster for you to travel on your own mount and kill the wyrms on the cliffs and perched on the pillars on the ground, like any other mob.  The quest only requires that you kill the wyrms and return the hammer when you're done.

==Progression==
In addition to the progression below, this quest requires first completing (at least part of) a very long quest chain started by [[Gretchen Fizzlespark]] in [[K3]] that ultimately leads to the [[Halls of Lightning]] instance.
