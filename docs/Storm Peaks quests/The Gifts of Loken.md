==Objectives==
Destroy Loken's Fury, Loken's Power, and Loken's Favor, and return to [[Bouldercrag the Rockshaper]] at [[Bouldercrag's Refuge]].
* [[Loken's Fury]] destroyed
* [[Loken's Power]] destroyed
* [[Loken's Favor]] destroyed

==Description==
The one who commands the stormforged iron dwarves is called [[Valduran the Stormborn]]. Although I have never seen them, it is said that his master, [[Loken|Keeper Loken]], who took over Ulduar, has given Valduran powerful [[titan]] artifacts.

It could explain the strength and ferocity my men see in the stormforged warriors.

Valduran's base, [[Nidavelir]], lies to the southwest, across the [[Snowdrift Plains]]. Go there, <name>, and neutralize his power. Destroy these gifts of Loken's and help us to sap the strength of his followers.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Leggings of Renewed Hope|Mantle of Bouldercrag|Rockshaper's Resolve|Bouldercrag's Pendant}}

==Progress==
Is it true? Does Valduran possess powerful relics of the titans? Did you destroy them?

==Completion==
<Bouldercrag nods grimly.>

You've weakened the stormforged considerably, but they'll keep fighting. Their casualties matter nothing to them, while our defenders continue to fall. Even if it costs them a hundred or a thousand iron corpses, they'll keep fighting until we've been pounded to gravel.

==Notes==
While killing golems, loot the [[Dark Armor Plate]] to continue the quest chain.
