==Objectives==
[[Brann Bronzebeard]] wants you to meet him at the [[Temple of Invention]] and help him combine [[:Norgannon's Shell]] and [[:Norgannon's Core]]. Once you have helped Brann, report back to [[Boktar Bloodfury]] at the [[Grom'arsh Crash-Site]].
*Help Brann create the keystone

==Description==
Aha! Here it is: the [[Temple of Invention]], the seat of Keeper [[Mimir]] himself! Of course, that's where one would go to join the two parts of the key.

According to the prospector's notes, the Temple of Invention is one of the highest points on the western side of the [[Terrace of the Makers]]. That means it should be roughly east of your Grom'arsh Crash Site.

I'll meet you at the temple and we'll combine the parts together.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Amberglow Signet
|Iceforged Battle Ring
|Jagged Ice Band
|Ring of the Northern Winds}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|14|80}}
*27550 [[XP]] or {{cost|16|53}} at 80
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Completion==
<Boktar nods in approval as you tell him how you helped Brann recover the pieces of the keystone and combine them.>

Brann may prove to be just the ally we need to discover what is truly happening in [[Ulduar]]. You've done well in aiding him. We need all the help we can get against this loken and his [[iron dwarf]] minions.

==Notes==
Brann is located at {{coords|45.5|49.5|Storm Peaks}}. Talk to him to start.
