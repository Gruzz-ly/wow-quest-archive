'''A Change of Scenery''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Reconvene with [[Lok'lira the Crone]] in [[Brunnhildar Village]]. 

==Description==
Excellent. There's an exit in the eastern end of the mine that leads to Brunnhildar Village. Follow it and I'll meet you there.

We must not be seen together so no one suspects you of aiding me. I'll use my magic to disguise my appearance. Do not worry, <race> -- we'll find your friend in no time. 

==Completion==
You're here -- good. I think I know where your goblin is.

==Notes==
Head east through the mine. Lok'lira is just outside the Brunnhildar entrance to the south.
