'''In Memoriam''' is part of a side chain to [[the Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[King Jokkum]] in [[Dun Niffelem]] wants you to collect 8 Horn Fragments from [[Thunderfall]].
* [[Horn Fragment]]: (8)

==Description==
Surely [[Thorim]] has told you of the tragedy that divides us.

It was in Thunderfall, northeast of here, that these events unfolded. The frozen fossils there are a reminder of that dark day, as are the spirits that haunt that place.

If my people are to forgive Thorim, something must take the place of those images. A memorial must be constructed to bring our hearts peace.

Go there, <race>. Collect the fragments of Hodir's Horn that was shattered that day.

==Progress==
Have you found the pieces of Hodir's Horn?

==Completion==
Another good deed you have done on Thorim's behalf, <class>.

This will help to soften the hearts of my people towards him.

==Notes==
The pieces litter the ground.
