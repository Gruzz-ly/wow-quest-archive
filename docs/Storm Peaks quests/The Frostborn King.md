==Objectives==
Speak to [[Yorg Stormheart]] in [[Frosthold]]. 

==Description==
Definitely... I can see exactly what the [[Norgannon's Core|core]] must look like. If any of the [[frostborn]] have seen it, they'll be sure to recognize the description.

There's no time to waste, let's get straight to business. Go talk to King Stormheart and request his aid... he's sure to know someone who can help us find the core. And be nice about it will you - he's very respected around here. 

==Completion==
Norgannon's Core? Never heard of it. I might well know someone that has though.
