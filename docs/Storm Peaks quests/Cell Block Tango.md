==Objectives==
[[Ricket]] at [[K3]] would like you to locate the Transporter Power Cell and use it to activate the Transportation Pad at [[Garm's Rise]].
* Garm Teleporter Activated
* [[Transporter Power Cell]]

==Description==
The [[sapper]] squad is ready. That means it's time for fun!

There's only one thing holding us up from our full-scale assault on [[Garm (subzone)|Garm]]! I sent a runner to set a teleporter up behind him--successfully I might add--and he returned to get the power cell it needs to function. It isn't working yet... which means the power cell didn't get there.

I need you look just on the other side of [[Garm's Bane]] for the power cell. When you find it, bring it farther east to Garm's Rise and activate the teleporter. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|80}}
*21,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Even the [[magnataur]] should know not to mess with [[goblin]]s.

==Completion==
Excellent!

<A fierce grin creeps onto Ricket's face.>

Let the destruction begin!

==Notes and trivia==
*The Transporter Power Cell is at {{coords|45.1|82.4|Storm Peaks}}, just to the east of Garm's Bane. The Teleporter is at {{coords|50.7|81.9|Storm Peaks}}, at the far east end of [[Garm's Rise]], to the east of [[Garm (subzone)|Garm]]. Use the [[Transporter Power Cell]] for a quick teleport back to [[K3]].
*The quest name is taken from a {{wp|Cell Block Tango|song}} in the musical {{wp|Chicago (musical)|Chicago}}.
