'''Leave No Goblin Behind''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Find the entrance to the [[Forlorn Mine]] in northern [[Sifreldar Village]] and look for clues for Zeev Fizzlespark's whereabouts. 

==Description==
All of our boys are back... thanks to you, <name>! Well... all but one.

My brother Zeev is still up there according to the others. Apparently they have some sort of mine where they make their prisoners work. Go in there and see if you can find out anything. 

==Completion==
You're definitely not with the Hyldnir... so what are you here for? Ah... you must be looking for the new prisoner!

==Notes==
Lok'lira can be found at {{coords|42.8|68.9|Storm Peaks}}, just inside the western entrance of [[The Forlorn Mine]].
