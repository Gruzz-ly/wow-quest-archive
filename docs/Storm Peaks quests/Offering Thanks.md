==Objectives==
Bring the crate of medical supplies to [[Glorthal Stiffbeard]] in [[Frosthold]].
* [[Medical Supply Crate]] (Provided)

==Description==
Ah! Thanks for coming up here, <lad/lass>.

Judging by your wide eyes and shivering hands, I'd venture a guess that you're somewhat new. Sounds like it would be good for you to meet our gracious hosts then!

We've got some extra medical supplies... to be honest, we weren't expecting to have such a comfortable setup. Go ahead and give this crate to Glorthal over there, and lend them a hand if you would too. We don't want them to think we're ungrateful for how welcoming they've been. 

==Progress==
Hello.

==Completion==
Medical supplies? Thank you! Not exactly sure what to do with them to be honest, but I'm sure they'll be useful.

It's good to meet you... there's such a colorful variety among your peoples. We're not used to having visitors up this way very often - it's good to have some fresh company.
