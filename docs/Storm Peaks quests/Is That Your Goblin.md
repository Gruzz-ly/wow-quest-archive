'''Is That Your Goblin?''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Challenge Agnetta Tyrsdottar in order to save [[Zeev Fizzlespark]]. Return to [[Lok'lira the Crone]] in [[Brunnhildar Village]] after you've succeeded.
* [[Agnetta Tyrsdottar]] slain

==Description==
I trust that's the green little one you've been looking for. If I were you I'd step in before that [[Hyldnir]] splits him in half.

You've arrived in the middle of the Hyldsmeet, so all challenges must be accepted by participants. There's nothing to stop you from taking your green friend's place. 

==Progress==
You're back.

==Completion==
Well done, young one. It looks like our deal has been satisfied on both our ends.

==Notes== 
:This puny green pup was of no use at the mines. No matter, he'll make for suitable warmup for battle.
{{gossip|''Skip the warmup, sister... or are you too scared to face someone your own size?''}}
