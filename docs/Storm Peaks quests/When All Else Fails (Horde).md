== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Ricket]] to make use of Ricket's [[D16 Propelled Delivery Device]] to enter further into [[Storm Peaks]]. 

== Description ==
So... so I don't think we're going to be getting a good foothold in those mountains.

Trust me, I'm not one to give up easily... but between freezing engines, nasty [[Vrykul]] women, territorial [[proto-dragon|dragon want-to-bes]] and the half a dozen other nasties settled in the area, this just ain't happening.

Don't let that dissuade you though! Just because we can't get a foothold doesn't mean we won't get you there... one-way trips are pretty simple when you get down to it.

<Ricket nods at some nearby rockets.> 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||68}}

== Completion ==
<Olut winces.>

That looked painful. It was a pretty grand entrance though.

Are you here to help us find a path into [[Icecrown]]? As you can see, our first foray in that direction didn't end too admirably. I'm thinking we might be better off breaching the place from another side.

==Notes==
Talk to Ricket to get on the rocket mount.
