==Objectives==
Speak to [[Mildred the Cruel]] inside the [[Forlorn Mine]]. 

==Description==
Our deal is made then, <name>. You help me get out of these chains and I'll help you find your little green friend.

The [[Hyldnir]] who runs this mine is known as Mildred the Cruel -- and with good reason.

Tell her you've been sent to lend a hand with the mines. Do whatever she asks until she trusts you with the keys to my shackles. 

==Completion==
I was expecting a replacement for one of my overseers. It's about time you showed up.

Let's put you to work.
