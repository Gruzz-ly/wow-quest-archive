==Progress==
Did you find Norgannon's shell?

==Completion==
That's it! That's the first half of Norgannon's keystone. Well done, <name>. I've had [[Archaeologist Andorin]] on the lookouts for clues to the shell's whereabouts for a long time. He's never going to believe me when I tell him it was an intrepid <race> who found it instead.
