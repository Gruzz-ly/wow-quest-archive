== Objectives ==
Recover [[Stormhoof's Spear]] and [[Stormhoof's Mail]] and return them to [[Xarantaur]] at [[Camp Tunka'lo]].
* [[Stormhoof's Spear]]
* [[Stormhoof's Mail]]

== Description ==
Not all of the camp's records have yet been corrupted. My staff has helped me to find those records which reflect the true timeline.

They agree that [[Stormhoof]] was given a burial of honor among the village elders on the bottom level of the [[Howling Hollow]], to the north.

Most of the graves there have already been destroyed, their contents taken as trophies by the [[North Wind]]'s subjects. Go to the hollow and see if you can recover Stormhoof's spear and armor from the scions of storm who have claimed them. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Progress ==
Have you found Stormhoof's weapon and armor?

== Completion ==
We are fortunate that you have recovered these intact, <name>. With them, I can use the Lorehammer to send you back in time, to where the North Wind started to corrupt the true timeline. It's the only way we can restore the true history of this place.
