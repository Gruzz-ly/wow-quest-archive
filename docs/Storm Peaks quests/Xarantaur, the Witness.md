== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Xarantaur]] at [[Camp Tunka'lo]]. 

== Description ==
It seems we're not the only visitors to this area. A courier relayed a message from a tauren named Xarantaur, who said he was visiting a [[taunka]] village called [[Camp Tunka'lo]]. The note was somewhat cryptic, but it seems this Xarantaur has come to Storm Peaks to learn the history of a taunka legend.

Meet up with him, <name>. See if what he knows can help us in any way. From his description, Camp Tunka'lo is far to the east, beyond the [[Terrace of the Makers]] and north of [[Dun Niffelem]]. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||74}}

== Completion ==
So Boktar received my note? That's excellent news. I doubted the taunka longrunner who carried it would reach anyone.
