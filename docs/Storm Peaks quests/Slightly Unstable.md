==Objectives==
Deliver [[Jeer Sparksocket|Jeer's]] Improved Land Mines to [[Ricket]] in [[K3]]
*[[Improved Land Mines]] (provided)

==Description==
Looking good!

No, not you - my new mines. You're a little full of yourself, aren't you? I, on the other hand, am absolutely brilliant! My intellect cannot be matched.

What were we talking about? Oh yes, my new mines! New and improved... ready for whatever devious use Ricket has concocted.

Be a good land and go hand them off to Ricket, will you? SHe's right over there... it should be quite the epic journey, I'm sure. Be careful though, she's a little loopy.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||68}}

==Progress==
Jeer finished the mines? Dandy.

==Completion==
Well, aren't these just the cutest little packets of destruction you've ever seen?!

==Progression==
