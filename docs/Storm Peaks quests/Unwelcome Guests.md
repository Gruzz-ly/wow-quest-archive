==Objectives==
[[Fjorlin Frostbrow]] at [[Frosthold]] wants you to kill 10 Stormforged Invaders.
* Stormforged Invaders slain (10)

==Description==
Our scouts have spotted [[Iron dwarf|Iron Dwarves]] in the valley north of here. I overheard [[Yorg Stormheart|King Stormheart]] sending you to visit [[Drom Frostgrip|Drom]] and I'm admittedly a bit worried about'm.

If you find any Iron Dwarves when you head down there, put'm down hard and fast for me, eh? I dun think they know exactly where we are or how to get here just yet, and I'd prefer to keep it that way. 

==Progress==
Were the scouts right? Were there dwarves down there?

==Completion==
Grim news, <lad/lass>. Those Iron Dwarves seem to be increasing in numbers... we've been seeing them al over the mountains. I smell war coming.

Thank you for dealing with this bunch... a little more time bought.

==Notes==
[[Stormforged Loreseeker]]s and [[Stormforged Pillager|Pillager]]s can be found in [[Frostgrip's Hollow]], at the base of the peak where players fought [[Sirana Iceshriek]]. Take a left at the first fork since the right path can't be used to exit after talking with Drom.

==Progression==
