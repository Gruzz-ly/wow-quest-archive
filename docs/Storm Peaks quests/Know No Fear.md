==Objectives==
[[Ricket]] at [[K3]] wants you to kill 6 Garm Watchers and 8 Snowblind Devotees.
* [[Garm Watcher]] slain (6)
* [[Snowblind Devotee]] slain (8)

==Description==
Now that we have the teleporter open, my plan is quite complex... it has several facets and will take impeccable coordination. And there are supplies to be gathered! And troops to recruit! Likely, weeks of hard labor as well!

Hahah, I had you going there for a moment, didn't I? You've got this, kid. Hop through the teleporter and take the fight to them! Our [[sapper]]s will back you up... they won't have anywhere to run. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|80}}

==Progress==
Nothing strikes fear into the enemy quite like a [[goblin]] [[sapper]]!

==Completion==
Haha! That'll teach those brutes to waste our time. From this day forth, green skin will strike fear into the hearts of all [[magnataur]]!

==Progression==
{{:Expression of Gratitude}}
