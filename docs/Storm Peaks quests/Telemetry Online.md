==Objectives==
Assist [[Mimiron]] in locating [[Hati]]'s essence.
* Mimiron assisted

==Description==
When [[:Titanstrike]]'s power [[The Power in Our Hands|was expended]] in [[Silithus]], Hati's essence managed to sever itself from the [[:Thunderspark]] just in time to avoid destruction.

The only problem is that his essence was then scattered across [[Azeroth]], and we don't know where.

Now that we've locked onto his energy signature, we should be able to triangulate Hati's position!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Everything is possible with science!

==Completion==
Now that we've located Hati's essence, we can move to phase two of my glorious plan!

==Notes==
;Assist Mimiron
:''The image begins walking to the console.''
:{{Text|say|Image of Mimiron|I'm engaging the triangulation protocol now. In a few moments we should know exactly where Hati's essence has run off to!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Grif Wildheart]]|There won't be any 'incompatibilities' this time... right?}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Mimiron|Of course not, Bronzebeard!}}
:''Having reached the console, the image gets to working on finding Hati's location.''
:{{Text|say|Image of Mimiron|Oh dear. I may have been premature in my assessment. Something is coming through!}}
:{{Text|say|Grif Wildheart|Looks like it's up tae us, <name>. For the wilds!}}
:''A rift in the air appears, spawning two [[Frigid Proto-Whelp]]s.''
:{{Text|say|Image of Mimiron|Proto-drakes... fascinating. Fascinating indeed!}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Mimiron|Cross-referencing the data with my archives now. Let's see where this signal is coming from!}}
:{{Text|say|Grif Wildheart|I got a feelin' we ain't out of the woods just yet, lass.}}
:''Another rift appears, with two Frigid Proto-Whelps and a [[Hyldnir Drakerider]].''
:{{Text|say|Grif Wildheart|Well? Do ye know where Hati's run off to?!}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Mimiron|According to my calculations, it's only locked onto a portion of Hati's essence. But indeed, Bronzebeard, we do!}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Mimiron|The signal originates from the [[Temple of Storms]] not far from here. Seems it's time to pay a visit to our friend [[Thorim]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Mimiron|Just a moment! More data coming in through the triangulation protocol. Analyzing...}}
:''Two rifts this time, with two [[Swarming Barbspine]] and four [[Frenzied Drone]]s.''
:{{Text|say|Image of Mimiron|[[Silithid]]? Most suspicious. Perhaps if I reference a different dataset... oh dear.}}
:{{Text|say|Grif Wildheart|What is it?! Is Hati alright?}}
:{{Text|say|Image of Mimiron|This is worse than I thought. I'm going to quarantine the signal. Hold on!}}
:''[[Hivelord Karixx]] spawns from the final rift. After the hivelord is dealt with, the image returns to its original position.''
:{{Text|say|Image of Mimiron|The remainder of Hati's essence is trapped in Silithus... dangerously close to the wound.}}
