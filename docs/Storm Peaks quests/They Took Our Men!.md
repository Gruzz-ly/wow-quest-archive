'''They Took Our Men!''' starts [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain|the ''long'' quest chain]] to unlock the [[Sons of Hodir]] reputation faction. Being able to fly in Northrend is a requirement for this quest chain.

[[Equipment Recovery]] is a complementary quest to this.

==Objectives==
[[Gretchen Fizzlespark]] wants you to go to [[Sifreldar Village]] and rescue 5 Goblin Prisoners.
*Goblin Prisoner Freed (5)

==Description==
You have to help us! We were in the middle of an expedition into the mountains to set up a transmission tower when we were attacked.

They looked like [[Vrykul]], except their skin was blue and layered with frost.... and they were all female! They took all the men in the expedition and let us women go. Please, <name>! We think they're being held in Sifreldar, the village overlooking [[K3]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Fur-Lined Shoulder Warmers|Fur-Lined Mittens|Summit Bracers|Chestguard of the Frozen Ascent|Frozen Mood Ring}}

==Progress==
Did you find our men, <name>?

==Completion==
You did it!  Our boys are back!

==Notes==
The Sifreldar hyldnir drop a [[Cold Iron Key]], which is used for the [[Rusty Cage]]s in and around Sifreldar. When searching for hyldnir to kill for the quest, head for the buildings; the ones in buildings seem more likely to drop the [[Cold Iron Key]] than the hyldnir wandering around.
