==Objectives==
Bring 5 Ore Samples to [[Bouldercrag the Rockshaper]] at [[Bouldercrag's Refuge]].
* [[Dark Ore Sample]] (5)

==Description==
At the [[The Frozen Mine|Frozen Mine]] in the western part of the [[Snowdrift Plains]], the stormforged iron dwarves have constructed a mine manned by slaves.

It's well behind the lines, so we haven't been able to find out much about what's going on there, but my scouts have reported seeing them remove cartloads of dark, sickly looking ore.

==Progress==
What have you discovered about the ore?

==Completion==
<Bouldercrag reaches out to take the ore, but then recoils.>

That ore... I can't touch it. It seethes with unnatural energy. No creature of stone can handle it. What do they mean to do with it?

==Notes==
[[Ore Cart]]s litter the [[mine]].
