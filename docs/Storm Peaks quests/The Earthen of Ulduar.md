== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Bouldercrag the Rockshaper]] at [[Bouldercrag's Refuge]]. 

== Description ==
The [[Earthen]] who once inhabited, built, and maintained [[Ulduar]] were ousted from their home when [[Loken]] took over the city. Since then, his [[iron dwarf]] followers have relentlessly attacked the exiles.

They have taken refuge in an old titan building, which they now call Bouldercrag's Refuge, on the face of a mountain west of the [[Inventor's Library]]. Bouldercrag and his brethren fight to keep the irons from overrunning their haven, but they cannot hold their ground long. Find and help them, <name>. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||74}}

== Completion ==
So you know Brann Bronzebeard, then? He is our closest ally among those of the flesh. We are as brothers in the struggle against Loken and his followers, in the struggle for Ulduar.

== Notes ==
This breadcrumb is offered by Brann after completing Norgannon's Shell.

Bouldercrag's Refuge is found at {{coords|30.4|36.7|Storm Peaks}}.
