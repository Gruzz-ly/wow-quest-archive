'''The Last of Her Kind''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Astrid Bjornrittar]] in [[Brunnhildar Village]] wants you to rescue an Icemaw Matriarch in the [[Hibernal Cavern]].
* [[Harnessed Icemaw Matriarch|Icemaw Matriarch]] Rescued
* [[Runed Harness]] (provided)

==Description==
For as long as I can remember, we've obtained our best bears from the Hibernal Cave to the east.

Those times might finally be gone. The cave has been overrun by ravenous [[jormungar]] and the wild bears are all but extinct.

If you were to find a surviving matriarch, however, I would guarantee you that she would fight better than any of these bears born in captivity.

Take this harness to the Hibernal Cave and rescue a surviving matriarch. Good luck finding one. 

==Progress==
Did you find a matriarch?

==Completion==
I'm impressed. I never thought I would see an icemaw matriarch again. Especially once this size.

==Notes==
The injured matriarch is in the eastern end of the same cave as [[The Slithering Darkness]] quest. The cave is located{{coords|55|64|Storm Peaks}} between [[Brunnhildar Village]] and [[Dun Niffelem]]. At the first fork, take a right, heading North and up the ramp.  You will find an [[Injured Icemaw Matriarch]].
