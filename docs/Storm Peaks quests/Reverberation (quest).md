==Objectives==
Use the [[:Thunderspark]] to summon an [[Essence of Hati]].
* Thunderspark placed
* Essence of Hati called

==Description==
[[Hati]]'s spirit is bound to yours forevermore, hunter. But it also now carries a link to the [[Temple of Storms]]--as well as [[Silithus]], I fear.

The Thunderspark shares these same bonds. By physically linking it here, you can call upon the different aspects of Hati's spirit and bind them to yourself as well.

Do not worry. [[Skoll]] and I will guard the Thunderspark with our very lives! It will be safe.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following: {{Abilities|Thunderous Bond|id=291592|icon=inv_trinket_80_titan01b}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It warms my heart to see Hati by your side once more.

==Completion==
You may return here any time you wish to rekindle your bond with Hati.

You shall forever be a welcome guest in my court.

==Notes==
It does not matter which version of Hati you select. Dismiss your current pet and use [[Tame Beast]] to tame the various appearances of Hati. If all your [[Call Pet]] slots are being used, speak to the [[YZ-37 Biorearrangement Unit]] to Thorim's right. [[Clockwerk]] is located to Thorim's left and sells various vanity items for Hati.
