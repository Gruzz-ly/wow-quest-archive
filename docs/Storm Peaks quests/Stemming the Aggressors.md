==Objectives==
[[Glorthal Stiffbeard]] at [[Frosthold]] wants you to kill 8 Frostfeather Screechers and 8 Frostfeather Witches.
* [[Frostfeather Screecher]] slain (8)
* [[Frostfeather Witch]] slain (8)

==Description==
Damn [[harpy|harpies]]. We've beat that bunch into submission more times than I can remember... and they stay quiet for a time after each bout. This time, I'd thought that maybe it sunk in.

Apparently not.

Their memory may be a bit short, but if their numbers are thinned enough, they'll keep to themselves. Head into the valleys in the north and east and clear out a fair chunk of them for me, will ya? 

==Progress==
Persistent buggers... can't ever seem to rid ourselves of all of them. They breed like rabbits.

==Completion==
It's dirty work, I know, but we appreciate it. Now what was the name the scout mentioned... [[Sirana Iceshriek|Sirana]]?

==Notes==
Do this quest alongside [[Baby Stealers]] to save some time.
