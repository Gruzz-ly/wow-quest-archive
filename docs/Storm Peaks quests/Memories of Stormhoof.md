== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Chieftain Swiftspear]] in [[Frostfloe Deep]], then return to [[Xarantaur]] at [[Camp Tunka'lo]].
* Ask Chieftain Swiftspear about his memories

== Description ==
When the [[bronze dragonflight]] gifted me with immortality and set me on the path of the witness, [[Nozdormu]] entrusted me with the [[The Lorehammer|Lorehammer]].

The hammer's reaction to your findings means that time has gone awry here and it is our duty to restore the true timeline.

We must find it. To the northwest is [[Frostfloe Deep]], ancient burial cave of the warriors of Tunka'lo. Seek out the spirit of Chieftain Swiftspear, [[Stormhoof]]'s brother. Ask him what he remembers of his brother's battle against the [[North Wind]]. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Completion ==
Even the chieftain is beginning to lose his memories? The past is being rewritten before our eyes and if we do not find out who is behind this, the entire legacy of Stormhoof could be lost forever.
