==Objectives==
[[Iva the Vengeful]] at [[Brunnhildar Village]] wants you to slay Yulda the Stormspeaker in [[Valkyrion]].
* [[Yulda the Stormspeaker]] slain

==Description==
The witch that started it all, Yulda the Stormspeaker came to our very village. She dared to insult our noble traditions and spouted the [[Lich King]]'s venomous promises of power.

She ought to have left with a sword through her but her magic was strong and she managed to escape.

Seek her in Valkyrion inside the largest dwelling and show her that we are not to be trifled with. 

==Progress==
Did you find Yulda?

==Completion==
Yulda had it coming. No one gets away with insulting the Hyldsmeet. Not even one of our own.

==Notes==
Yulda is in the large house at 24.0, 61.6

This quest goes well with [[Aberrations]] and [[Off With Their Black Wings]].
