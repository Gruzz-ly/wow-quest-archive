==Objectives==
[[Ricket]] at [[K3]] wants you to kill [[Gnarlhide]].
*[[Gnarlhide]] slain

==Description==
I know just the job for an eager newcomer! We've got a [[gnoll]] problem. You might even call it a gnoll infestation! Pesky things. They keep creeping up more and more, and now they're on our doorstep, stealing our parts! Inconceivable.

It all begins and ends with their uppity leader, Gnarlhide. I want you to see to that "ends" part. Go pay him a visit at his camp all the way to the west, in [[Snowblind Hills]].

And when I say "pay him a visit," that's a euphemism for "kill him painfully." Kay? Kay!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|80}}
*21,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I like Ricket cause she's sooo delicious!

Oh, hey there again! How goes the pest control?

==Completion==
Groovy! You're my kind of <race>.

==Notes==
Gnarlhide is at the westernmost camp, at {{coords|30.4|85.7|Storm Peaks}}.
