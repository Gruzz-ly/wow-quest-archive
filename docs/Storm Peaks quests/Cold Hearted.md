'''Cold Hearted''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Brijana]], just east of [[Brunnhildar Village]], wants you to fly to [[Dun Niffelem]], then free 3 Captured Proto-Drakes and rescue 9 Brunnhildar Prisoners.
* Recued Brunnhildar Prisoners (9)
* [[Freed Proto-Drake]]s (3)

==Description==
To be slain honorably on the field of battle brings us all glory. To be frozen in a block of ice and endlessly taunted does not....

You are to fly to the frost giant city of Dun Niffelem, just east of the [[Valley of Ancient Winters]], and liberate a captive proto-drake. With her, you will be able to free our sisters from their frozen bonds and carry three of them safely home.

Beware the giants' clubs, sister, lest you find yourself numbered among the captives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*22050 [[XP]] (or {{cost|13|23}} at 80)

==Progress==
Was your mission successful, sister?

==Completion==
Your efforts appear to have been successful, sister.

You have brought glory to the Brunnhildar!

==Notes==
Fly up into Dun Niffelem and mount a {{NPC||Captive Proto-Drake}} in the air {{coords|65|61|Storm Peaks}}.

Keep moving as the frost giants can throw and hit unwary riders from a fairly large distance.

Target a {{NPC||Brunnhildar Prisoner}}, and hit the Ice Shard button once it's in range. Don't move until the prisoner is yanked up to the drake.

The [[Captive Proto-Drake|drake]] can carry three prisoners (one behind the rider, one in each claw), so pick up as many as possible before leaving Dun Niffelem to save trips. As soon as the drake is outside of Dun Niffelem, it'll fly back to the village on its own ("The proto-drake smells freedom and flies homeward!"). Do not dismount or the quest will not reward credit.

Try to avoid getting killed. When resurrecting, the giants (contrary to the usual practice) aren't visible until after respawning (most likely) under the feet of a level 80 Elite.
