==Objectives==
[[Ricket]] at [[K3]] wants you to use [[:Improved Land Mines]] at [[Garm's Bane]] to fend off the attackers from [[Garm (subzone)|Garm]]. Both [[Garm Invader]]s and [[Snowblind Follower]]s will count towards this goal.
* Garm Attackers slain (12)

==Description==
I've been waiting an eternity for these mines! Well, a few days at least. What took him so long?

Here's the low down, compadre... there's this nasty bunch of [[magnataur]]--you know, big, hairy, and extremely ugly—and they seem pretty keen on taking K3 for themselves.

Not going to happen.

We've got some defenses set up in their path, northeast of here. Sadly, our [[K3 Perimeter Turret|laser turrets]] have pretty limited power supplies... that's where these mines come in! Get over there and blow them up good! 

==Rewards==

==Progress==
You got some of their gross little snobold buddies too I hope?

==Completion==
So... here I sat, basking in the awesomeness that is me, and in the distance, I hear a pop! Then another! Then a dozen more! And a smile crept onto my face at the thought of all those magnataur and snobolds eagerly rushing to their own deaths.

Was it glorious?
