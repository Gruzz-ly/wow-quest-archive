==Objectives==
[[Bruor Ironbane]] at [[Bouldercrag's Refuge]] wants you to kill 10 Nidavelir Stormforged. You may kill [[Stormforged Champion]]s, [[Stormforged Magus|Stormforged Magi]], or [[Stormforged War Golem]]s.
* Nidavelir Stormforged slain (10)

==Description==
Like [[Bouldercrag the Rockshaper|Bouldercrag]], I once served the keepers as a craftsman in [[Ulduar]], but with [[Loken]]'s betrayal, I turned my hammer toward our new foes.

When we could spare the men, I led raids on [[Nidavelir]] to relieve the pressure on our defenders, but our lines are near collapse.

You've proven yourself a capable combatant and a staunch ally. Perhaps you'd be willing to take up our banner and take the fight to Nidavelir, the [[iron dwarf]] stronghold to the southwest, across the [[Snowdrift Plains]]. 

==Progress==
Have you taken the hammer to the irons at Nidavelir?

==Completion==
There may be hope for victory, <name>. We have never been able to sustain an attack on the stormforged, but with your efforts, Valduran may yet fall!

==Notes==
While killing golems, loot the [[Dark Armor Plate]] to continue the quest chain.
