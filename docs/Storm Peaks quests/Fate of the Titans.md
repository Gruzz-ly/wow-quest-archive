==Objectives==
[[Creteus]] in the [[Foot Steppes]] has requests that you travel to the Temple of Invention, the Temple of Winter, the Temple of Life, and the Temple of Order and utilize the databank to examine each area.
* [[Temple of Invention]] Investigated
* [[Temple of Winter]] Investigated
* [[Temple of Life]] Investigated
* [[Temple of Order]] Investigated
* [[Creteus' Mobile Databank]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Norgannon's Core]] is not at this location. I am not sure why you seek it, <race>, and I am equally unsure if you truly know the purpose of that which you seek.

I would like you to aid me before I consider extending my assistance. I have recently encountered knowledge of the watcher, [[Thorim]]. His seat of power is contested, and his fate remains to be seen. This troubles me, for I do not know of the other watchers. Utilize this databank to examine their temples to the northeast and return the knowledge to me. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ring of Order|Spiked Iceclimber's Boots|Cuffs of Invention|Mantle of Long Winter}}

==Progress==
Have you returned with the knowledge that I seek, <race>?

==Completion==
The news you bear forth is grave indeed. I do not know the fate of the remaining watchers, but their absence spells dark times for all of the lands of [[Azeroth]].

I shall examine the knowledge contained in the databank that you have returned and attempt to fully assess the situation. I believe I am in possession of knowledge that you deem more pertinent at this moment however, so I shall allow you to partake in said wisdom first.

==Notes==
The Databank will fly about to check a temple; you may want to mount up to follow it. Once summoned, the Databank can also fly to follow you to other temples. In order to analyse a temple, summon it at the center of a temple, or fly to the middle with it following you, and it will begin after a moment.
