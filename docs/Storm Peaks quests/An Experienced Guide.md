==Objectives==
Locate [[Drom Frostgrip]]. 

==Description==
I don't know where this core is hiding, but ye knew that. I said I'd help though, and that I shall.

There's a hermit by the name of Drom Frostgrip that lives in a cave north of here... down in tha valley. We've strayed away from the [[titans]] a bit ourselves being that there are so few about, but Drom's loyal to the old ways... he keeps an eye on their most precious places and speaks te the keeper [[Creteus]] often.

Yer sure to find him in the back of his cave... tell'm I sent ye and he'll help ye. 

==Completion==
<Drom coughs up a bit of blood.>

Norgannon's Core, eh? I've spent a fair number of days trying to find anything I could about it myself but it seems to be one of the relics that's still guarded. With reason I suppose.

If King Stormheart sent you, he must see something noble in ye... and I'm not one to refuse my king.

==Notes==
:{{text|whisper|Fjorlin Frostbrow|Over here <laddy/lassie>, I have something I could use a hand with.}}

Pick up [[Unwelcome Guests]] from Fjorlin before heading out.

[[Frostgrip's Hollow]]{{coords|26.8|66.8|Storm Peaks}} is at the base of the peak where players fought [[Sirana Iceshriek]]. Take a left at the first fork, as the other paths are all one-way and can't be used to exit after speaking with Drom.
