==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ricket]] to make use of Ricket's [[D16 Propelled Delivery Device]] to enter further into [[Storm Peaks]]. 

==Description==
So... so I don't think we're going to be getting a good foothold in those mountains.

Trust me, I'm not one to give up easily... but between freezing engines, nasty [[Vrykul]] women, territorial [[proto-dragon|dragon want-to-bes]] and the half a dozen other nasties settled in the area, this just ain't happening.

Don't let that dissuade you though! Just because we can't get a foothold doesn't mean we won't get you there... one-way trips are pretty simple when you get down to it.

<Ricket nods at some nearby rockets.> 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||68}}

==Completion==
Ow! That looked painful. It was a pretty grand entrance though, lad.

Welcome to Frosthold! Are ya here to help us find a path into [[Icecrown]]?

==Notes==
Talk to Ricket to get on the rocket mount.

{{gossip|I am ready to head further into Storm Peaks.}}

The D16 Propelled Delivery Device takes players to [[Frosthold]]. Eventually.
