== Objectives ==
Use the {{loot|common|The Inventor's Disk|Inventor's Disk}} to retrieve 7 pieces of Hidden Data from the [[Databank]]s. Use [[Brann's Communicator]] to contact [[Brann Bronzebeard]] once you've completed this task.

If you lose Brann's Communicator, speak to [[Morteha Windborn]] at the [[Grom'arsh Crash-Site]] to replace it.
* Hidden Data gathered (7)
* [[The Inventor's Disk]] (Provided)

== Description ==
That disk you assembled... it's blank! [[Keeper Mimir]], the tinker who built this library, must've hidden the information elsewhere. Look around the [[Inventor's Library]]; do you see any databanks there?

That might be the disk's purpose. Try using it near some of those databanks. Perhaps it's set to retrieve and store information from them. After you've tried your hand at that, contact me again and let me know what you've found. Meanwhile, I'll be trying to track down the other half of the archive key. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Progress ==
Did you try using the disk? What did you find?

== Completion ==
<Brann looks at the disks as you hold it up.>

I can't tell if there's anything stored there or not, <lad/lass>. You'll have to tell me what happened.

<You describe the data retrieval process.>

So it worked? At least we can count on Keeper Mimir to be systematic.
