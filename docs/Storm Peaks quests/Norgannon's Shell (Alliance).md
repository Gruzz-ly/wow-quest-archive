==Objectives==
Recover Norgannon's Shell from [[Archivist Mechaton]]. Contact [[Brann Bronzebeard]] with [[Brann's Communicator]] once you've accomplished this.

If you lose Brann's Communicator, speak to [[Archaeologist Andorin]] at [[Frosthold]] to replace it.
* [[Norgannon's Shell]]
* [[Charged Disk]] (provided)

==Description==
Charging inventor's disk.

Disk charging completed.

Preparing emergency protocol gamma.

Emergency protocol loaded. Please use the charged disk to activate the guardian of Norgannon's shell, Archivist Mechaton. The archivist will release the shell once your identity has been verified.

Please have a pleasant millennium.

==Progress==
Well, don't just stand there, show me the shell!

==Completion==
That's it! That's the first half of Norgannon's keystone. Well done, <name>. When I get back to [[Ironforge]] I'm going to have you inducted as an honorary member in the [[Explorers' League]]!

==Notes==
On accept, players will receive the Charged Disk from the console. Use it to start the event.

Be sure to use the Charged Disk while still at the console. It is possible to use the Charged Disk outside of the library (for example, on the patio). This will summon Mechaton at the console, where he will attack whoever is present.
