==Objectives==
Clear out [[Telzo Sparkspanner|Sparkspanner]]'s army.
*Jump in the [[First Squadron Prototype]]
*Defeat Sparkspanner's Army

==Description==
[[Fizzi Tinkerbow|Tinkerbow]] has finished installing the guns on our [[flying machine]]s, so it's time to give them a trial by fire. We've got confirmation that our target is in fact within the [[Halls of Stone]].

Let's start clearing out the forces out in front. We'll take the earliest opportunity to bring the fight to Sparkspanner!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|46|80|}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I think we've dealt with enough of them. Time for the end game!

==Notes==
[[File:Operation Troggageddon - Terrace of the Makers.jpg|thumb|Sparkspanner's forces on the Terrace of the Makers]]
Interact with the First Squadron Prototype to enter it. Once again, Winklespring acts as the pilot with the player in the backseat. Upon takeoff:
:{{Text|say|[[Fizzi Tinkerbow]]|Careful, Commander. The [[Ulduar|titan facility]]'s exterior defenses may have been rewired to see us as intruders.}}
:{{Text|say|Cog Captain Winklespring|Worry not, tinker. I am an excellent pilot.}}
:{{Text|say|Fizzi Tinkerbow|I'll keep that in mind when we get shot out of the sky, Cog Captain.}}

The plane automatically flies down toward the [[Terrace of the Makers]] and enters a large circuit route around the terrace and the areas outside [[Ulduar]]. Both areas are swarming with Sparkspanner's troops: [[Ironbound Invader]]s, [[Warbot 15x|Warbots 15x]], [[Reprogrammed Librarian]]s, [[Sparkspanner Commander]]s, [[Ulduar Defense Construct]]s, and [[Aerial Defense Unit]]s. The latter two types are unattackable and do not count for the quest. The prototype has two abilities:
#{{Abilities|Standard Issue Bomber Gun|id=292542|Start up the bomber gun, dealing damage periodically to enemies in front of the flying machine.|icon=ships_ability_bombers}}
#{{Abilities|Buster Cannon Mk. II|id=288832|Fire Mekkatorque's patented Buster Cannon at the target location, instantly obliterating enemies.|icon=spell_nature_unrelentingstorm}}

Kill Sparkspanner's forces to fill the bar up to 100%.
