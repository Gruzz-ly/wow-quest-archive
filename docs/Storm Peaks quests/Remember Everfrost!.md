'''Remember Everfrost!''' is the repeatable version of the quest [[Everfrost (quest)]] and can be turned in to Calder in [[Dun Niffelem]] for +455 [[Sons of Hodir]] reputation at a time.  This is very similar to the [[Netherwing]] quest [[Accepting All Eggs]].

==Progress==
Have you discovered any more everfrost, little <race>?
*[[Everfrost Chip]]

==Completion==
Well done, little <class>.

Everfrost was once plentiful in this region. Over the ages, though, the jormungar devoured nearly all of it. It is now very rare and very precious to my people.

As you roam these lands, keep a lookout for more pieces of everfrost. Return to me with any that you find and we will be most grateful.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|50}}
*+455 [[reputation]] with [[Sons of Hodir]]

== Notes ==
[[Everfrost Chip]]s are most commonly found in the [[Valley of Ancient Winters]], [[Thunderfall]], and [[Fjorn's Anvil]] all of which are located near [[Dun Niffelem]] in [[Storm Peaks]].

==Progression==
# [[Everfrost (quest)]] (+455 rep)
# [[Remember Everfrost!]] ([[Repeatable quest|R]]) (+455 rep)
