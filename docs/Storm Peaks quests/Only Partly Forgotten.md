==Objectives==
An [[Injured Goblin Miner]] in [[Crystalweb Cavern]] wants you to bring back an Icetip Venom Sac from an [[Icetip Crawler]].
* [[Icetip Venom Sac]]

==Description==
Oi... it's like there's a propeller in my stomach.

I think I can walk, but I got something nasty in my system when I got bit by something in the back of the cave. It was bigger than the other spiders... and brightly colored.

[[Ricket]] can probably make me an antidote, but she'd need the venom sac from whatever bit me. Would you mind finding it for me? I don't think [[Tore Rumblewrench|Tore's]] coming.

I'll just pretend I'm dead here and hopefully they'll leave me alone. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|80}}
*21600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The Injured Goblin Miner writhes in pain.>

==Completion==
That should cut it... I hope Ricket can put something together for me. Ready to get out of there, then?

==Notes==
The Icetip Crawlers are at the back of the cave, far to the northeast.
