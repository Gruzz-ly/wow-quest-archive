'''Into the Pit''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Astrid Bjornrittar]], in [[Brunnhildar Village]], wants you to use the [[Reins of the Warbear Matriarch (Brunnhildar Village)]] inside the [[Pit of the Fang]] and defeat 6 Hyldsmeet Warbears.
* [[Hyldsmeet Warbear]] slain (6)

==Description==
Besting a tethered opponent is one thing. Fighting other bear riders on equal footing is another.

Head into the Pit of the Fang and use what you've learned to defeat your opponents. Good luck, sister.

Glory awaits, should you succeed. 

==Progress==
Hail, sister.

==Completion==
You really did it! You made it out with your health. Wish we could say the same for your bear.

It's going to take a while for her to recover. Fortunately you won't need her for a while.
