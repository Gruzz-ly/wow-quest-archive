==Objectives==
[[Tore Rumblewrench]] outside of [[Crystalweb Cavern]] wants you to kill 12 Crystalweb Spiders.
*Crystalweb Spiders slain (12)

==Description==
Hiya! The name's Tore. I head up the mining operation here at [[K3]]... or I will shortly anyway!

This here cave is full of creepy-crawlies. I think we could do with a few less [[spider]]s before we move in - what'd you think? 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|80}}

==Progress==
Be careful near [[U.D.E.D. Dispenser|that dispenser]]! [[U.D.E.D.|Those things]] are dangerous.

==Completion==
Ha ha! Good to see you're up for some dirty wook.

Much appreciated there, pal!

==Notes==
*Mobs granting progress: [[Crystalweb Weaver]], [[Crystalweb Spitter]] and [[Icetip Crawler]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
