==Objectives==
You are to defeat 5 Niffelem Forefathers and 5 Restless Frostborn at [[Thunderfall]]. You are then to blow Hodir's Horn over their corpses, then return to [[:Hodir's Horn]] in [[Dun Niffelem]].
*[[Niffelem Forefather]] freed (5)
*Restless Frostborn freed (5)
*[[Hodir's Horn]] (provided)

==Description==
You have done a great service to the [[frost giant|giants]] of [[Dun Niffelem]]. Without your aid, this monument would not exist.

As you silently ponder its significance, feelings begin to flood your heart. The feelings fill your mind with thoughts and images... as well as a sense of urgency.

The sensations fade and leave you with a knowledge of what you must do. The restless spirits at Thunderfall must be put to rest.

As you set off, you find that your hands have been filled with an ethereal horn.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
Strong gusts of wind swirl around the horn, causing its sound to echo throughout the surrounding mountains.

To any unknowing passersby, it might seem to be blowing itself....

==Completion==
You are filled with a sense of peace and contentment knowing that the once tormented souls of Thunderfall are now resting peacefully.

==Notes==
*The horn can be used on the remains of [[Restless Frostborn Warrior]]s, [[Restless Frostborn Ghost]]s and [[Niffelem Forefather]]s.
