'''Battling the Elements''' is part of [[the Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Njormeld]] wants you to accompany [[Snorri]] to [[Fjorn's Anvil|Fjorn's anvil]] and help him kill 10 Seething Revenants.
* [[Seething Revenant]]s slain (10)

==Description==
Snorri was once the pride of our nation. A mighty warrior, many an enemy fell to his club.

We honor him, though he's no longer what he once was. Age has taken its toll, dulling his senses and sapping his strength. Still, he remains as proud as ever, never missing an opportunity to join a battle.

Speaking of battle, we're cooling Fjorn's anvil so it can be taken home. The remaining fire revenants are putting up some resistance. Help Snorri relive his glory days, <race>. Guide him against this enemy. 

==Progress==
Were you able to lead Snorri to another victory, <class>?

==Completion==
An honorable performance, <race>. I shall inform the [[King Jokkum|king]] of your assistance.

The anvil is nearly cool enough. I shall see you in [[Dun Niffelem]] soon.

==Notes==
[[Snorri]] is easy to control.  Guide him to a snow drift, make a snowball, target a revenant, and toss.  Rinse, repeat.  While you are guiding Snorri, [[Njormeld]] is not visible.  He reappears once you dismount Snorri.

Complete this quest to get credit for [[Forging an Alliance]].
