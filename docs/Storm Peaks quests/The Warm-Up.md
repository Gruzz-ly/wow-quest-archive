'''The Warm-Up''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Astrid Bjornrittar]] in [[Brunnhildar Village]] wants you to use the [[Reins of the Warbear Matriarch (Brunnhildar Village)]] to defeat Kirgaraak.
* [[Kirgaraak]] Defeated

==Description==
You've been very fortunate, sister. This is a matriarch the likes of which hasn't been seen in years.

A good bear won't do you much good without the skill to ride it.

I'm going to have you practice some moves on Kirgaraak. He's the largest yeti we've ever managed to capture so be careful. Don't be afraid to walk away if he gives you a beating... there's a reason why we keep him chained. 

==Progress==
How did it go with the yeti?

==Completion==
Not bad. I was hoping Kirgaraak would snap your neck so I could keep your bear.

Just joking, sister. Well... half-joking. That's a really nice bear you've got.

==Notes==
The reins put you in control of a [[Warbear Matriarch]].  For this quest, you are able to take your warbear around the town, not just at the Pit of the Fang.

#1 is melee attack, 4 is Maul, doing ~1k damage, 5 is a knockback, 6 is a charge.
