==Objectives==
Bring 4 Dark Armor Samples to [[Bruor Ironbane]] at [[Bouldercrag's Refuge]]. 
* [[Dark Armor Sample]] (4, 1 provided)

==Description==
This armor plate is thick and oversized compared to the rest of the golem's defenses. A quick examination of the golem's corpse reveals that this heavier plate seems to have been bolted on as an afterthought or a crude upgrade.

Why would the iron dwarves have added this redundant and mismatched armor to their war golems?

Perhaps Bruor Ironbane would know if he had the chance to examine several of these plates from stormforged war golems.

==Progress==
What is it you have there?

==Completion==
Careful, now. Keep that plate as far away from me as you can. Even being in its presence is enough to inflict pain.

But you're right, <name>, these are gigantic armor plates for a war golem of normal size. What would the stormforged be doing with them? There's only one way to find out.

==Notes==
The samples are 100% drop after accepting the quest.

One sample drops for each party member if grouped, so you only need kill 3 more constructs to complete the quest.
