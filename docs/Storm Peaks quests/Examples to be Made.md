'''Examples to be Made''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Mildred the Cruel]] at the [[Forlorn Mine]] wants you to slay Garhal.
* [[Garhal]] slain

==Description==
For every action there is an opposite reaction, sister. In the case of us applying pressure on the males, this has meant newly spread rumors of insurrection.

The bearded pig behind this rabble-rousing is called Garhal. Put an end to him... and make sure the other males see his demise. They must learn that insubordination will not be tolerated. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|3|60}}

==Progress==
You're back. Did you kill the insubordinate pig?

==Completion==
If I had any reservations regarding your commitment when you first arrived. With just a little more effort you could be a permanent member of my operation.

==Notes==
Garhal is located just east of Mildred, accompanied by two other male vrykul and guarded by two females.

Aggro Garhal and Garhal alone to only have to kill one mob instead of three.

Garhal may happen say any of the following while not aggroed:
*{{text|say|Garhal|I'm not looking to cause trouble, but if things don't change around here, you're going to have an insurrection on you hands.}}
*{{text|say|Garhal|I'd be careful if I were you, Hyldnir. We're not afraid to lose a few men if it means smashing your pretty blue faces in.}}
*{{text|say|Garhal|This is just a warning, wench. You strike one of us again, and we'll kill you in your sleep.}}
