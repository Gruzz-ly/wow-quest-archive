==Objectives==
[[Bloodguard Lorga]] wants you to go to the [[Gimorak's Den]] to the east and obtain 6 [[Worg Fur]]s.
* [[Worg Fur]] (6)
* [[Bright Flare]] (provided)

==Description==
The cold in these mountains is brutal. We have a day or two before we burn up all the wood from the wreckage.

We spotted [[worg]]s inside a cave directly east of here. I need you to find the cave and obtain some furs. It might not sound like much, but it might be the difference between freezing to death and living another day.

Worgs don't hunt alone, so I'm giving you a flare. It should buy you some time if you find yourself outnumbered. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Frosthowl Cinch
|Nomadic Bracers
|Chestplate of the Northern Ranger
|Coldblooded Legplates}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|10}}

==Progress==
Did you bring the fur?

==Completion==
These furs are rather... large. I'd hate to see the worgs you had to face off with.

We're all very thankful. The temperature is starting to drop already.
