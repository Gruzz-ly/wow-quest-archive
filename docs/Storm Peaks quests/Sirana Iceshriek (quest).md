==Objectives==
[[Glorthal Stiffbeard]] at [[Frosthold]] wants you to kill Sirana Iceshriek.
* [[Sirana Iceshriek]] slain
Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
This Sirana Iceshriek sounds like the one that's spurring the [[harpy|harpies]] to be more aggressive. If we kill her, I suspect their attacks won't last long afterwards.

One of our stormriders claims to have spotted her circling the peak directly northwest of here. Go find the wench and put her down. Let's see this done. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Wand of Chilled Renewal|Iceshrieker's Touch}}

{{Rfg-section|5.0.4}}
{{itembox|The following were originally included as rewards:|Razor-sharp Ice Shards |Weighted Throwing Axe}}

==Progress==
It's too cold here for the usual pests... we get harpies. Lucky us.

==Completion==
It's done then, thank you.

I've spoken with [[Fjorlin Frostbrow|Fjorlin]] - he said that his men will take charge of keeping the harpies down a bit. As long as we don't let up again, they won't find the courage to think they can attack our people.

I know this wasn't the most tasteful work - take this as a token of my appreciation.

==Notes==
Sirana has ~126k health and can be found circling the peak just northwest of Frosthold at {{coords|25|67|Storm Peaks}}
