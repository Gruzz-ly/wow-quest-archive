==Objectives==
[[Ricket]] at [[K3]] wants you to repossess 16 Dried Gnoll Rations from the nearby [[Savage Hill tribe|Savage Hill]] Gnolls.
*[[Dried Gnoll Rations]] (16)

==Description==
Hey hey! You're a new face! Care to lend Ricket a hand?

We have a somewhat unexpected problem - food shortage. I know, I know... we should have seen that coming, but you don't get it. We tend to have somewhat of a quick turn-around here with our [[sapper]] squad and all, so usually we don't have to worry about long term eats. Good old K3's gotten popular though.

Convenient solution? There are [[gnoll]] camps to the west and some gnolls scattered, scavenging as gnolls do. Care to go nab some of their rations?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*21,600 [[XP]]
*{{cost|6|80}}

==Progress==
Hey there again! My belly's rumbling... how'd it go?

==Completion==
I hope they weren't too hesitant to share the wealth. We've been pretty forgiving with them picking through our leftovers thus far.

==Notes==
There are food crates in the gnoll camps which can be used to speed up the process, dramatically.

==Progression==
