==Objectives==
Bring Norgannon's Core back to [[Creteus]] in the [[Foot Steppes]].
* [[Norgannon's Core]] (provided)

==Description==
<As you retrieve the core from the chest, you hear the thumping of heavy footsteps rushing towards you from the corridor. There is the faint sound of battle in the distance.> 

==Completion==
Someone is using the [[Forge of Wills]] to create this army... [[Ulduar]] is no longer safe.

<Race>, I am pleased that you were able to reach the core before these abominations were.

==Notes==
On accept, an elite Frostborn Axemaster will spawn as the player's guardian:
:{{text|say|Frostborn Axemaster|Hail! I hate to rush you, but there's an army of [[Iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] here to stop whatever you and Creteus are trying to do... we need to get out of here.}}

Halfway to the exit of the cave, other Axemasters are fighting off Stormforged Warmongers, taking the place of the ice revenants.
:{{text|say|Frostborn Axemaster|[[Yorg Stormheart|King Stormheart]] caught wind of the iron dwarves heading this way and brought all the best warriors he could muster on such short notice.}}

Outside the cave, all hell is breaking loose as the [[frostborn]] are fighting off Amplifiers and elite Decimators.
:{{text|say|Frostborn Axemaster|Quickly, Creteus is to the west. King Stormheart is holding them off, but they have the advantage of numbers.}}

As the player catches sight of Yorg Stormheart and Creteus:
:{{text|say|Frostborn Axemaster|By the watchers, look at him fight. I've never seen a more vicious warrior... I'm glad to call him my king.}}

As the player talks to Creteus:
:{{text|say|Frostborn Axemaster|We'll hold them off as long as we can. Do whatever you need to do quickly!}}
