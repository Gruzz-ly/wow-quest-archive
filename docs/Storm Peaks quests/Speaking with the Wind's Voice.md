== Objectives ==
Bring 5 [[Voice of the Wind|Voices of the Wind]] to [[Moteha Windborn]] at the [[Grom'arsh Crash-Site]].
* [[Voice of the Wind]] (5)

== Description ==
I suppose we shouldn't have expected to find [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]] so easily, not with our luck. If we can make sense of what Brann is saying, you can persuade him to give up his location.

The power of the wind is strong in these mountains, and it may prove a great boon to us. A knowledgeable shaman can hear the sound of all the world's tongues on the wind.

To the northwest, on the [[Snowdrift Plains]], you will find beings made of wind, the [[Stormrider (elemental)|stormriders]]. Capture their voices and bring them to me. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Progress ==
Have you brought the wind's voices?

== Completion ==
You should be able to communicate with the dwarf now. Ask [[Boktar Bloodfury|Boktar]] what he requires of you. There is little time to lose.
