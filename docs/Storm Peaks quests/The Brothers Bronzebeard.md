In this quest the player jumps in Brann's flying machine, while he flies it to Frosthold, the player must defend it against the iron dwarves as they attempt to fly to the hold.

==Objectives==
Accompany [[Brann Bronzebeard]] and his [[Brann's Flying Machine|flying machine]] to [[Frosthold]].
* Accompany Brann Bronzebeard to Frosthold.

==Description==
That does it! We finally have the keystone... It's beautiful! I've been around the world more than once, but this thing's got me all jittery with excitement again. I suppose now's not the time to stop and admire though, we need to get the heck out of here.

Hop on my flying machine and help keep us covered from those [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] on the way out!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Ring of the Northern Winds|Jagged Ice Band|Amberglow Signet|Iceforged Battle Ring}}

==Progress==
My pardons, <lad/lass>! I got all caught up in tha moment and I neglected ye entirely.

==Completion==
King Stormheart sends his most sincere thanks for reuniting him with his brothers. It seems he's off to settle a score now - perhaps you'll meet with him again on Arthas's doorstep.

==Notes==
[[File:Bronzebeard Brothers.jpg|thumb|300px|The brothers Bronzebeard, reunited]]
Accept the quest and hop on {{NPC|Alliance|Brann's Flying Machine}}. [[Stormforged Soldier|Stormforged Soldiers]] will jump from the edge and land on the other wing. Kill them before they do too much damage to the plane.

Upon landing at Frosthold, wait for the reunion scene (below) to play out completely. Once it does, the quest objective will be complete.

:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard| I can't thank you enough for all of your help in putting together the [[keystone]]. Great things will come of this, I assure you.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|[[Iron dwarf|Iron dwarves]]... everywhere.... they're making their way down from the top. They certainly are persistent.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|They're trying to take down the [[Brann's Flying Machine|plane]]! I can't pull up any steeper... you need to keep them off of us!}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|There are more just ahead - keep at it!}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|We're almost out... just a little bit farther.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Barring stray boulders from those giants, we should be clear... it seems a mess from down there though.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Their numbers are unbelievable... I'm glad to hear [[Yorg Stormheart|King Stormheart]] came to your aid. I only hear good things of him - I think it's high time we meet.}}
:''Brann flies over [[Creteus]]' corpse, surrounded by iron dwarves.''
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Poor Creteus. He was a good [[Stone keeper|keeper]]... I'm glad he at least got to see his task to completion, I imagine that's all that really mattered to him.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|We're coming up on [[Frosthold]]. I would be very appreciative if you would introduce me to King Stormheart before you go. I believe we are both very much in his debt.}}
:''Brann lands and both dwarves walk up to each other. Brann pauses for a moment as he looks Yorg over.''
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|By all the gods... it can't be... [[Muradin Bronzebeard|Muradin]]?!}}
:{{text|say|Yorg Stormeheart|What's that? You talkin' to me, lad?}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Come on boy, there's no mistak'n it - it's definitely you. Don't ya recognize your younger brother?!}}
:{{text|say|Yorg Stormeheart|My brother... yes... I do have brothers...}}
:{{text|emote|Muradin clutches his head and reels for a moment as the memories rush back to him.}}
:{{text|say|Yorg Stormeheart|...Brann?}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|I can't believe this! You were dead! All accounts said so... what happened, Muradin. How did you get here?}}
:{{text|say|Yorg Stormeheart|I... I dun know, Brann. I've been 'ere a long time... all I 'ave of me life before this place are flashes and nightmares.}}
:{{text|say|Yorg Stormeheart|It's good te see you though, brother. More than words can say.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Indeed! [[Magni]] will be so happy to see you too! He's gotten nothing but bad news for a long while now, but this changes everything!}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|He's here in [[Northrend]] brother, looking for you. A [[Zelig the Visionary|seer]] in [[Wintergarde]] [[Frostmourne Cavern|brought word that you were not dead]], and he left [[Ironforge]] immediately to come find you.}}
:{{text|yell|Magni Bronzebeard|Look [[Lagnus]], I consider you a capable man, but my patience is wearing thin. I know that Muradin is here, can you point me to him or not?!}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Speaking of which...}}
:''Brann and Muradin turn toward the path down into the hold, as Magni comes up the rise.''
:{{text|yell|Magni Bronzebeard|Brother! There you are! I can barely believe my eyes... you're alive!}}
:''Magni runs over to his brothers and stands to Brann's right, as the two face Muradin.''
:{{text|say|Yorg Stormeheart|Magni! Forgive me, the memories are comin' back slowly, brother.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|It's so good to see you again, Muradin. And what's this I heard about you being a King in your own right now? The [[Bronzebeard]]s were always destined to greatness.}}
:{{text|say|Yorg Stormeheart|The [[frostborn]] have been very good to me. They're strong people.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|So it seems! And you haven't lost any muscle yourself. Do you remember anything of what happened, Muradin? Fate as turned ill in your absence.}}
:{{text|say|Yorg Stormeheart|Not much, Magni. I've had nightmares of a [[human]]... tall... light hair... [[Death knight|death black armor]]. His name rests on the tip of me tongue, but...}}
:{{text|say|Yorg Stormeheart|...[[Arthas]].}}
:{{text|emote|Magni nods.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|He's not the boy of your memories anymore, Muradin. He's become something else entirely.}}
:{{text|say|Yorg Stormeheart|Aye, I know. I watched him turn... I watched him give up all that was right and I didn't lift a hand... I didn't even consider it until it was too late.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|That's in the past, Muradin. Regrets won't change anything.}}
:{{text|say|Yorg Stormeheart|No... no they won't. But I can make this right... I have te. I'm goin' after the boy. I'll make'm answer for everything he's done.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|Are you sure Muradin? I just got you back after years of thinking you were dead. I do not want to lose you again.}}
:{{text|say|Yorg Stormeheart|I'm sure, Magni. I'll see this through, don't ya worry.}}
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|So be it then. I have to return to my people, brothers. Come back to me in one piece.}}
:{{text|say|Brann Bronzebeard|Aye, be safe Muradin. I'd join you, but I'm on top of the [[Ulduar|most amazing discovery]] the world has yet seen. I can't abandon it now.}}
:{{text|say|Yorg Stormeheart|Go Brann. Bring me back an epic tale when we meet again. Farewell for now, brothers.}}
:''Muradin bows and turning, starts walking away.''
:{{text|say|Magni Bronzebeard|...farewell brother.}}
:''Magni and Brann turn around and also walk away. Muradin walks on to [[Velog Icebellow]], who is now standing in "Yorg's" place. They face each other for a few moments, apparently talking. Muradin then walks over to [[Fjorlin Frostbrow]] and despawns; he left his [[Storm Hammer]] with Fjorlin and then it seems he flew away from Frosthold on a [[Stormcrest Eagle]].''
