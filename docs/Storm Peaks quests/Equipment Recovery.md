This is a side quest complementary to [[They Took Our Men!]]

==Objectives==
[[Gretchen Fizzlespark]] wants you to obtain 8 pieces of K3 Equipment in [[Sifreldar Village]] north of [[K3]].
*[[K3 Equipment]] (8)

==Description==
Please, <name>. When the [[Hyldnir]] [[They Took Our Men!|took our men]], they also took all our equipment. Of course, it's more important that we get our boys back, but if you run into any of our equipment, I'd really appreciate it if you brought it back to us.

You'll find their village just above us, to the north.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|10}}

==Progress==
Any luck with our equipment, <name>?

==Completion==
Thanks, <name>!  We'll see what we can do to salvage these parts!

==Notes==
[[K3 Equipment]] crates can be found littering the grounds of Sifreldar. Inside buildings too.
