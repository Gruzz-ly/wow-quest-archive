==Objectives==
Take the Inventor's Disk to the [[Inventor's Library Console]] inside the [[Inventor's Library]].
* [[The Inventor's Disk]] (Provided)

==Description==
Norgannon's shell is within our reach, <name>. Take the inventor's disk into the library's interior. There should be a console there that you can activate with the disk. I imagine [[Mimir]] stored more there than just Norgannon's shell. There are probably enough schematics stored there to keep [[Ironforge]]'s engineers occupied for years!

Anyway, use the disk to recover the shell. Hopefully, Mimir hasn't decided to put any more obstacles in our way. 

==Progress==
The console appears to have an opening for the inventor's disk.

==Completion==
<You insert the disk into the console. Suddenly, lights on its surface illuminate and a mechanical voice speaks.

Inventor's disk authenticated. Welcome back, Keeper Mimir.
