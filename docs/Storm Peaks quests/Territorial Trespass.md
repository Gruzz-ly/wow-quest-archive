'''Territorial Trespass''' is part of [[the Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Place the Stolen Proto-Dragon Eggs on top of the [[Broodmother's Nest]] and return to [[Thorim]] at the [[Temple of Storms]].
*[[Veranus]] Lured
*[[Stolen Proto-Dragon Eggs]] (provided)

==Description==
Veranus is proud like no other beast I've known. She still keeps her old nest and makes sure none of the younger proto-drakes takes it over.

Take the eggs you've collected and place them on her nest. You'll find it atop a small peak, directly southeast of here.

I should be able to get control of her before she kills you in a fit of rage. Hopefully. 

==Rewards==

Hail, <name>!

==Completion==
It's good to have my old friend back.  It appears that my luck is finally starting to change... and it's all thanks to you, little friend.

==Notes==
The [[Broodmother's Nest]] is quite a large nest South-east of the Temple of Storms.  It is its own 'area' of [[the Storm Peaks]], so it is easy to tell when you are in the right place.  Once you have placed the eggs, Veranus comes to the nest:

:{{text|emote|Veranus lets out a bellowing roar as she descends upon the nest.}}
''Veranus lands in the center of the nest, a truly massive proto-drake. (You may mount up now if you wish.) But before she can do anything, Thorim hollers a warning:''
:{{text|yell|Thorim|Look out below!}}
''Thorim spawns right above Veranus and lands on her shoulders in a riding position.''
:{{text|say|Thorim|Easy there, girl!  Don't you recognize your old master?}}
:{{text|say|Thorim|I will see you at the Temple of Storms.  Looks like I'm going to have to break her in again.}}
''Rider and proto-drake despawn.''
