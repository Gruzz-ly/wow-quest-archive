== Objectives ==
Use the Chieftain's Totem to close 4 Frostfloe Rifts, then bring the totem to [[Xarantaur]] at [[Camp Tunka'lo]].
* Frostfloe Rifts closed (4)
* [[The Chieftain's Totem]] (Provided)

== Description ==
This, the tomb of Tunka'lo's warriors, is supposed to be a serene place, free from the terror of the elements.

[[Frostfloe Deep]] has been invaded by a strange force, one that disturbs the spirits of the fallen and blurs my memories of my own life.

It's as though our deeds and memories are being erased from history.

In life, this totem was a symbol of my authority. It is the last true link I have to this world. Take it, use it to restore calm to the tomb, and then return it to Camp Tunka'lo. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Progress ==
What is it you have brought from the tomb?

== Completion ==
The chieftain's spirit told you to bring this to me?

<Xarantaur examines the totem.>

Ah, I see what he intended. By telling you to use this totem to close the rifts in the deep, he has given us a clue as to what's happening to the timeline. A wise chieftain, this Swiftspear, watching over his people even in death.
