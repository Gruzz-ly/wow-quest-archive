==Objectives==
[[Bouldercrag the Rockshaper]] at [[Bouldercrag's Refuge]] wants you to free 6 Captive Mechagnomes and kill 3 Stormforged Taskmasters.
* Attempt to free [[Captive Mechagnome]]: (8)
* [[Stormforged Taskmaster]] slain: (3)

==Description==
To the southwest, on the western side of the [[Snowdrift Plains]], the [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] have dug a mine into the hillside. There, they use captive [[mechagnome]]s, servants of [[Keeper Mimir]], to mine ore.

I don't know where these mechagnomes came from, nor what they would do with their freedom, but perhaps we can win their help.

Go to the [[The Frozen Mine|Frozen Mine]], <name>, and set these creatures free from their bondage. Ask if they would fight alongside us against iron dwarf tyranny.

==Progress==
Have you freed the slaves of the stormforged?

==Completion==
I had hoped that more of the captives would choose to join us, but I do not blame them. Willing allies are few and far between, and we are thankful that you have lent your blade to our cause.

==Notes==
When speaking to a Captive Mechagnome:
:Go back to work before the overseer sees us.
{{gossip|''I'm not a laborer. I'm here to free you from servitude in the mines.''}}

Captive Mechagnomes will then say any of the following:
*{{text|say|Does not compute. Unit malfunctioning. Directive: shut down.}}
*{{text|say|New directive: leave mine and return to [[Inventor's Library]].}}
*{{text|say|New directive: assist in the defeat of the iron dwarves.}}
*{{text|say|Free again? Keeper Mimir's work awaits.}}
*{{text|say|Thank you, <race>. I will join your struggle against the stormforged.}}
