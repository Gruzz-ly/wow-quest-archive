==Objectives==
Kill 10 Stormforged Artificers and return to [[Bruor Ironbane]] at [[Bouldercrag's Refuge]].
* [[Stormforged Artificer]] slain (10)

==Description==
[[Bouldercrag the Rockshaper|Bouldercrag's]] got a good plan to stymie the efforts of the [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] at [[Narvir's Cradle]], and I've got an idea of my own. Work on the iron colossus will come to a halt without any artisans.

Narvir's Cradle is on the south side of the hill sheltering Bouldercrag's Refuge. Go there and slay any stormforged artificers in your path. They may be no different from what we once were, but they build a weapon that threatens us all. 

==Progress==
Have you decimated the iron colossus' workforce?

==Completion==
There were days when I could never ask someone to do what you did, but my experience with iron dwarves has extinguished those feelings. We have bought time against the enemy's advance.

==Notes==
Interrupt the artificer's cast! If they get one off, Overload will hit for ~1400 damage.
