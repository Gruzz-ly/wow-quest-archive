== Objectives ==
Find [[Prospector Khrona's Notes]] and [[Prospector Soren's Maps]] at [[Brann's Base-Camp]]. Once you have them, use [[Brann's Communicator]] to contact [[Brann Bronzebeard]].

If you lose Brann's Communicator, speak to [[Moteha Windborn]] at the [[Grom'arsh Crash-Site]] to replace it.
* [[Prospector Khrona's Notes]]
* [[Prospector Soren's Maps]]

== Description ==
With [[Norgannon's Shell]] in hand, only half of the archive key remains to be found. Luckily, I've had the [[Explorers' League]] hard at work chasing down leads about the whereabouts of [[Norgannon's Core]].

Far to the southeast of the [[Inventor's Library]], on the slopes to the north of [[Dun Niffelem]], is a camp bearing my name. The Explorers' League representatives seeking the second half of the key are based there. Bring me the maps and the notes they've made and we should be able to track down the other key half. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Progress ==
Have you recovered those notes?

== Completion ==
Ruined? What d'you mean, the camp's been ruined?

<Brann clenches his fists in anger.>

Those [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] will pay for this! There's little we can do now, and we have to focus on finishing the key. But once I get into the halls of [[Ulduar]], the irons and their masters will answer for what they've done!

== Notes ==
* Notes: {{coords|59.8|52.6|Storm Peaks}}
* Maps: {{coords|59.2|51.5|Storm Peaks}}
