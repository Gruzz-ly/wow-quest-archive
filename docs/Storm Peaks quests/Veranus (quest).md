'''Veranus''' is part of [[the Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Thorim]], at the [[Temple of Storms]], wants you to obtain 5 Small Proto-Drake Eggs from the peaks near [[Brunnhildar Village]].
* [[Small Proto-Drake Egg]]: (5)

==Description==
If I'm to launch an attack against my brother's army, I'm going to need some way to get around.

I released my riding drake back into the wild years ago. [[Veranus]] was magnificent. The leader of her own brood -- to whom she has now returned.

Finding her will be hard, but perhaps there's a way. She keeps her old empty nest out of pure pride. She's a broodmother in name only, for she is beyond the age of breeding.

Bring me small eggs from the other nests near Brunnhildar. I think I've an idea. 

==Progress==
Did you obtain the eggs, <name>?

==Completion==
Yes... these will do. Let us hope my plan works, <name>.

Veranus is a great drake. I'd hate to settle for a lesser one.

==Notes==
Look south of Brunnhildar. Around {{coords|52|74|Storm Peaks}} and {{coords|44|67|Storm Peaks}} on top of the peak.
