==Objectives==
Use the [[Earthen Mining Pick]] to mine 7 clumps of Enchanted Earth. Bring the earth and 5 Frostweave cloth to [[Bouldercrag the Rockshaper]] at [[Bouldercrag's Refuge]].
* [[Enchanted Earth]] (7)
* [[Frostweave Cloth]] (5)

==Description==
It seems so long ago that these hammers pounded and hewed stone instead of iron. Our expulsion from [[Ulduar]] saw the weakest of us dead and the strongest of our craftsmen reborn as warriors.

As the irons beat us back, even the strongest find themselves failing.

We can do little for the wounded, save when we have a stock of enchanted earth. We used to mine it from the deposits on the sheer cliff face to the northwest, but the constant battle has prevented us from replenishing our stock. Would you help? 

==Progress==
Were you able to find any of the earth?

==Completion==
This will allow us to patch up much more of the fallen. Thank you, <name>, on behalf of all who defend the refuge.

==Notes==
Go north out of the refuge and down the cliff face on the main land (facing north).
