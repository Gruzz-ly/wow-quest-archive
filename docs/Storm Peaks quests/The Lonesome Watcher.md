==Objectives==
Recover Frostgrip's Signet Ring from an [[Stormforged Monitor|Iron Dwarf Monitor]] and then bring it to [[Creteus]] in the [[Foot Steppes]].
*[[Frostgrip's Signet Ring]]

==Description==
I never found the core... but I've often spoken to the keeper Creteus, and his omissions give him away. You'll find Creteus over the mountains to the east, in the Foot Steppes, keeping watch on the [[Engine of the Makers]]. The core might well be in there, but you'll need to win Creteus's favor.

The [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] were here looking for something... it might well be the core. They took my ring. Find their leader, get the ring back, and show it to Creteus so that he knows I sent you. 

==Progress==
Hello, <race>.

I am pleased that you have opted to utilize your tongue over your blade when making my acquaintance. I have found that a more and more rare quality among your kind of late.

==Completion==
Drom's ring? I am to assume Drom is not well if he did not introduce you directly. I am sorry to hear of that. Drom is a noble dwarf, if an inquisitive one.

On what business have you come then?

==Notes==
Head towards the only exit from Drom's room, and take a left at the first fork. The Stormforged Monitor will jump down and then a [[Stormforged Eradicator]] will walk in.
:{{text|say|Stormforged Monitor|Halt. If the core is in your possession, please place it safely on the ground to avoid damage it make {{Sic}} incur during your elimination.}}
:{{text|say|Stormforged Monitor|Elimination will now commence. Thanks you for your cooperation.}}
The Stormforged Monitor and his Eradicator begin their attack, when suddenly an unexpected ally jumps into the fray:
:{{text|say|Frostborn Axemaster|Not if I have something to say about it, sparky!}}
On victory:
:{{text|say|Frostborn Axemaster|King Stormheart had me stop by to lend you hand - looks like it was good that I did. Good luck to ya.}}

If you still need to complete [[Unwelcome Guests]], the Stormforged Monitor also counts for a kill.
