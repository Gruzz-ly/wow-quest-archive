==Objectives==
[[Iva the Vengeful]] in [[Brunnhildar Village]] wants you to go to [[Valkyrion]] and slay 12 Nascent Val'lkyr.
* [[Nascent Val'kyr]] slain (12)

==Description==
Traitors. We [[Hyldnir]] have little love for them.

The dwellers of Valkyrion have gone unpunished for far too long. While we remained loyal to [[Thorim]], they became the [[Lich King]]'s lapdogs!

They call the ones who receive his gift [[val'kyr]]. They fly on feathered wings, like the harpies they are.

You will find Valkyrion far to the northwest, beyond the [[Temple of Storms]]. Slay these winged she-wolves, sister. Slay them and I will reward you with one of my most prized possessions.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Flowing Valkyrion Robes|Hyldnir Painbringer|Iva's Boots|Proto-Drake Cover|Scaled Proto-Wristguard}}

==Progress==
Did you punish our wayward brethren?

==Completion==
The Val'kyr are nothing but the Lich King's lapdogs. They will be put down like the scum they are. They've made their choice, now they have to live with the consequences.

== Notes ==
This quest combines well with [[Aberrations]] and [[Yulda's Folly]].
