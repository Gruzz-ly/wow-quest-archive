'''Discipline''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Mildred the Cruel]] at the [[Forlorn Mine]] wants you to use the [[Disciplining Rod]] on 6 Exhausted Vrykul.
* [[Exhausted Vrykul]] Disciplined (6)

==Description==
Let's start you off with something straightforward. The male [[vrykul]] that work the mines for us do so against their will... purely out of fear of our blades.

Once in a while, one of them will lose their motivation. Find any uncooperative vrykul and put them in their place.

Take this disciplining rod. You'll want to inflict pain, not death. Well, most of the time anyway. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards
|Mildred's Cowl
|Cured Proto-Drake Leggings
|Mildred's Grasp
|Vrykul Training Helm}}
You will also receive: {{cost|3|60}}

==Progress==
Is it done? I hope you didn't slay too many of the mongrels. We need the manpower.

==Completion==
Not bad for a new overseer. I've another task for you if you're feeling brave today.

==Notes==
Not all Exhausted Vrykul take kindly to getting whacked with the disciplining rod.
