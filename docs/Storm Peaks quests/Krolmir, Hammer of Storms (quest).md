'''Krolmir, Hammer of Storms''' is part of [[the Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Thorim]] wants you to talk to [[King Jokkum]] in [[Dun Niffelem]] and discover what he knows of [[Krolmir]].
* Krolmir's Fate Discovered
* [[The Sons of Hodir]] ({{reputation|Friendly}})

==Description==
One task remains before I can reclaim my home at the [[Terrace of the Makers]].

Krolmir must be found.

On that fateful day, I threw it to the earth with all the power and rage I possessed. A mighty explosion followed.

I've thought it lost for these many years, but now I must be certain.

Return to King Jokkum and discover what, if anything, he knows of my hammer's fate.

At {{reputation|neutral}}, the following dialog takes place:
{{gossip|''If it please you, King Jokkum, may I know what has become of Krolmir?''}}
:I do not trust you enough to speak of such things.
:You must respect the trials our people have endured, the burdens we have borne...
:Perhaps, if you were to bring great honor to Dun Niffelem, I would be inclined to share with you the knowledge of our people.

This response is no longer possible; the reputation awarded for completing previous quests have been increased to ensure that the character is at least {{reputation|Honored}} by the time they reach this point in the chain.

At {{reputation|friendly}}, the following dialog can take place:
{{gossip|''If it please you, King Jokkum, may I know what has become of Krolmir?''}}
:Very well, little <class>.
:While there is much left for you to do to mend our relations with Thorim, I am compelled to share with you this one secret.
:Speak to me again when you are ready to be shown that which you seek.
{{gossip|''I am ready to be shown the fate of Krolmir.''}}

:{{text|say|King Jokkum|Hold on, little <race>.}}
:''Players hitch a ride with Jokkum as he jogs up to [[Thunderfall]]. He stops in the center of the crater and auto-dismounts the player (you will receive a small bit of fall damage). He then calls down Thorim.''
:{{text|yell|King Jokkum |Thorim! Come, show yourself!}}
:''Thorim flys to the crater on [[Veranus]] and leaps off, kneeling before Jokkum.''
:{{text|say|Thorim|King Jokkum, you have summoned me?}}
:{{text|say|King Jokkum|The deeds of your <race> servant defy <his/her> stature, Stormlord. <His/Her> efforts have succeeded in softening the hearts of my people.}}
:{{text|say|Thorim|Jokkum, [[Arngrim the Insatiable|son of Arngrim]], I have always regretted my actions here. In my grief, I brought great harm to those closest to me.}}
:{{text|say|Thorim|I would ask your forgiveness for the suffering I have caused you and your people.}}
:{{text|say|King Jokkum|Never have such humble words come from mighty Thorim. I shall deliver your words to Dun Niffelem.}}
:''Thorim stands up.''
:{{text|say|King Jokkum|The events of that dark day are hereby forgiven by my people. They shall never again be spoken of.}}
:{{text|say|King Jokkum|To signify our reforged friendship, I have something which belongs to you...}}
:''Jokkum summons Krolmir, encased in a block of ice.''

:{{text|say|King Jokkum|As the great explosion filled the region, my father cast a rune at the great hammer that it might not be had by our enemies. It was his final act...}}
:{{text|say|Thorim|Krolmir... I thank you Jokkum. I hadn't dared hope it still existed. It shall soon see glorious battle once again!}}
:{{text|say|King Jokkum|We welcome the opportunity to fight by your side, mighty Thorim.}}
:{{text|say|King Jokkum|I must return to Dun Niffelem. We shall speak again soon, Stormlord.}}
