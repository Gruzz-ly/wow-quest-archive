You must be at least {{reputation|neutral}} with the [[Sons of Hodir]] to be offered this quest.

==Description==
No ordinary tributes were good enough for the great [[Hodir]] when he walked among the frost giants.

He might not be with us anymore, but we've kept the tradition of offering tribute to his strength and wisdom.  It would do much for your renown to partake in this tradition, small <class>.
