'''A Certain Prisoner''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Take Mildred's Key to [[Lok'lira the Crone]] in the [[Forlorn Mine]].
* [[Mildred's Key]] (Provided)

==Description==
You are without mercy. You will do well around these parts.

I have another task to ask of you. There is a female [[vrykul]] prisoner that's become more of a liability than I had anticipated.

She had the gall to claim the right to take part in the Hyldsmeet, our sacred competition of strength and fighting prowess.

Here's the key to her shackles. Make it as painless as possible. She's a female after all, even if not one of us. 

==Progress==
It's about time.

==Completion==
I knew you'd be back! Get me out of these shackles and I'll help you find the goblin.
