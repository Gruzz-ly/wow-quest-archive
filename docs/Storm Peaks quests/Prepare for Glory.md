==Description==
This is it then. I'll take care of your bear now, you won't be needing her. The great Drakkensryd will be your next challenge.

Say goodbye to your friends and leave your affairs in order, for you will return victorious... or you won't return at all. 

==Completion==
You've really made it this far. Never would I have though you'd progress so quickly among the [[hyldnir]].
