== Objectives ==
Look for [[Tracker Val'zij]] inside [[Gimorak's Den]], southeast of the [[Grom'arsh Crash Site]].

== Description ==
I can't in good conscience send you to the worg cave without warning you that the previous person we sent there hasn't returned.

We're prepared for the worst, but perhaps there's a chance that he's alive. We'd appreciate it if you helped him return—Tracker Val'zij is one of the only hunters we have. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|3|70}}

== Completion ==
This hurts bad, mon.  Don't know if I'm gonna make it.
