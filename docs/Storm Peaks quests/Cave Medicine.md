==Objectives==
[[Tracker Val'zij]], at [[Gimorak's Den]], wants you to obtain 1 Jormungar [[Toxin Gland]] and 8 [[Cave Mushroom]]s.
* [[Cave Mushroom]] (8)
* [[Toxin Gland]]

==Description==
It's good to see a friendly face. Might be the last one I see.

One of those jormungar stung me with some sort of toxin before I managed to get away. I can feel my whole body getting numb, mon.

I'm going to need a toxin gland to make an antidote. I will also need some of the cave mushrooms that grow here... they'll slow the toxin down.

Hurry, please. I don't have much time. 

== Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
You back, mon?

==Completion==
I thank you, mon.  I might live another day now.
