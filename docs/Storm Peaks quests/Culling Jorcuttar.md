'''Culling Jorcuttar''' requires {{reputation|friendly}} with [[The Sons of Hodir]]. It is a side quest in the overarching [[the Sons of Hodir quest chain|Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[King Jokkum]] in [[Dun Niffelem]] wants you to slay Jorcuttar in [[Hibernal Cavern]].
* [[Jorcuttar]] slain

==Description==
I have an opportunity that will help you to gain approval with my people, provided you prevail.

The [[jormungar]] are a nuisance best dealt with quickly. If given any quarter, they breed like hares and spread like fire.

They have appeared southwest of here, in the Hibernal Cavern. If their spawnmother is not slain soon, they will gain a foothold in our region.

She cannot refuse food. Take this knife and get the flank of a bear corpse from their cave. Place it near her crater and kill her as she feeds. 

* [[Everfrost Razor]] (provided)

==Progress==
Have you slain Jormuttar?

==Completion==
So it is done.

We have heard the screams of Jormuttar as they echoed from across the valley.

You have done our people a service this day, little <race>.

==Notes==
[[File:Everfrost Shards.jpg|thumb|Jorcuttar was here.]]
It will take a few tries using the skinning knife to get an appropriate bear. Also, sometimes this quest must be completed before King Jokkum will help you complete [[Krolmir, Hammer of Storms]]

The quest name is likely a reference to the popular "Yo Mama is so fat..." jokes.
