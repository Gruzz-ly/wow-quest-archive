== Objectives ==
Use [[Brann's Communicator]] to contact [[Brann Bronzebeard]] and find out what to do next. Once you have completed Brann's instructions, use Brann's Communicator to contact Brann Bronzebeard.

If you lose Brann's Communicator, speak to [[Moteha Windborn]] at the [[Grom'arsh Crash-Site]] to replace it.
* [[The Inventor's Disk]]

== Description ==
We've seen the [[Iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] and their constructs making war on the creatures of stone that Brann calls the [[Earthen]], along with their giant allies. Contact him and aid him in any way you can, and remember that anything we can learn from his search may aid us in fighting against the iron dwarves and their master.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Progress ==
Did you complete the disk?

== Completion ==
That was quick! Now that we have the disk, we have to find out how to use it to unlock the first half of the archive key.

== Notes ==
Summon Brann's image with the communicator.

:I've got a lead on [[Norgannon]]'s keystone, which guards access to [[Ulduar]]'s archives, but the [[Titan]]s divided it into two pieces and secreted them away

:One of the pieces, the keystone's shell, is held within the [[Inventor's Library]] on the northern coast, south of Ulduar itself. The first thing you'll need to do is retrieve the fragments of an access disk from the [[Library Guardian|library's guardian]]s.

The library's guardians are found around {{coords|38|43|Storm Peaks}}, just north of the crash site. Acquire 6 [[Inventor's Disk Fragment]]s then combine them into [[The Inventor's Disk]].
