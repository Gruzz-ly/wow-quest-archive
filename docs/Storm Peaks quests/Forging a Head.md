'''Forging a Head''' requires {{reputation|friendly}} with the [[Sons of Hodir]].

==Objectives==
[[Njormeld]] in [[Dun Niffelem]] needs you to use the [[Diamond Tipped Pick]] on the [[Dead Iron Giant]]s at [[Frostfield Lake]] and return to him when you have collected 8 Stormforged Eyes.
* [[Stormforged Eye]] (8)
* [[Diamond Tipped Pick]] (provided)

==Description==
Greetings, <race>.

I have a task that [[King Jokkum]] felt you would be suited for, assuming you still strive to gain favor with our people.

I have developed plans for another artifact, one that will grant [[Hodir]]'s blessing of protection to our stronghold. I have nearly all that I require for its construction. All that remains to collect is the very eyes of our fallen enemies.

Take this tool, and gather the eyes from the Iron Giant corpses that litter our fields. 

==Progress==
Have you collected the final components I seek, <race>?

==Completion==
It is nearly done.

With this artifact in place, Dun Niffelem shall be warned of impending dangers before they are upon us.

==Notes==
Frostfield Lake, not [[Thunderfall]].

Be wary, occasionally 3 [[Stormforged Ambusher]]s will pop out of the corpse, one or two of which will have an eye.  ... but all of which will attack you.
