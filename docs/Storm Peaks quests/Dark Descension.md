==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Riftwalker Nilara.png||Nilara has looked up to the Windrunner sisters her entire life. It was the honor of a lifetime to be able to work alongside Alleria.}}
Confront the missing Riftwalker.
* [[Riftwalker Nilara]] confronted

==Description==
What are these [[Void-spawn|void spawn]] doing here? Could it be [[Xal'atath|the Harbinger]]'s doing? Some power of the [[Dark Heart]]?

Well. I do not mean to stand idly by.

We must confront the Riftwalker. I don't think she will see reason now, but perhaps she can tell us something.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|56|18}}
* 15x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
What would the Harbinger want with [[Ulduar]]?

==Completion==
;Non-void elf
:It's my charge to teach the [[ren'dorei]] to withstand the Void's whispers. If only I had gotten to the Riftwalker before the Harbinger did...

:Nilara. Her name was Nilara, wasn't it.

;Void elves
:It's my charge to teach you and your fellow ren'dorei to withstand the Void's whispers. If only I had gotten to the Riftwalker before the Harbinger did...

:Nilara. Her name was Nilara, wasn't it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|The Harbinger|So you finally arrived. My honored guests.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|That voice...}}

Aggro:
:{{text|say|Riftalkwer Nilara|The Harbinger shall usher in a new age for the void elves!}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|The shadows have taken her. Defend yourself!}}

Defeat her:
:{{text|say|The Harbinger|You seek my Dark Heart? Very well. Come take it.}}
:''The ethereals all exit via their [[Shadowguard Portal]]s, leaving only the ones trying to breach Ulduar behind.''
