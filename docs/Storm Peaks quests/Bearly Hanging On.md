'''Bearly Hanging On''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Brijana]] at [[Brunnhildar Village]] wants you to mount [[Icefang]] and shoot 7 Frostworgs and 15 Frost Giants in the [[Valley of Ancient Winters]].
* Frostworgs Burned (7)
* Frost Giants Burned (15)

==Description==
The test awaits, woman!

Do you have the heart of a warrior queen? Or that of a sniveling seamstress?

One taste of war and you'll know the answer.

You might lie to your mother, your sisters, and even yourself, but the battlefield always exposes one's true nature.

When you've made your preparations, mount Icefang and ride into battle. From her back, you must rain down a shower of death upon our enemy. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
Have you survived the battle, <name>?

==Completion==
Perhaps you do have the heart of a warrior...

Time will tell.

==Notes==
You mount Icefang as a vehicle.  He begins a loop run down the [[Valley of Ancient Winters]] and back.

You have two abilities:
* [[Image:Spell_fire_searingtotem.png|20px]] - (1) a medium ranged AoE fire attack
* [[Image:Ability_racial_bearform.png|20px]] - (2) a short duration speed increase.

Burn worgs and frost giants with the attack.  Try to lead the target.
