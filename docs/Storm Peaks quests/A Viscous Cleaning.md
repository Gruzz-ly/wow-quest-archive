==Objectives==
You are to enter [[Hibernal Cavern]] west of [[Dun Niffelem]] and collect 5 units of Viscous Oil from the [[Viscous Oil (mob)|Viscous Oil]]s there.

You are then to return to Dun Niffelem and apply the oil to [[Hodir's Helm]].
* [[Viscous Oil]] (5)

==Description==
As you draw near the helm, you notice that the frigid environment is already taking its toll on the artifact's surface. What is now just a thin layer of ice will surely grow to envelop it entirely.

Not about to let your hard efforts go to waste, you resolve to scour the region in search of a solution.

Just as you set off, the eyes of the helm flash and an image of the nearby Hibernal Cavern enters your mind. 

==Progress==
Frost is thickening on the helm as you watch, and icicles are beginning to form around its edges...

==Completion==
As you coat the helm with a thin layer of oil, the frost falls away and the surface gleams.

==Progression==
