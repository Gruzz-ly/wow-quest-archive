== Objectives ==
Mount [[Frostbite (frostsaber)|Frostbite]] and ride her to the source of the scent from [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]]'s note. Then, recover [[Brann's Communicator]] and use it to make contact with Brann Bronzebeard.
* Track scent to its source
* [[Tracker Thulin]] slain

== Description ==
Boktar can have his way this time, but I'll expect him to make it up to me. Don't look at me like that. Boktar may be in command, but no one tells a hunter what to do.

'Put that beast away,' he says. 'Make it stop growling.'

All of a sudden he changes his mind when it suits him. Next time he complains, Frostbite'll just nip him a bit. Don't worry, she'll do an admirable job tracking your prey. After she locates her target, you're on your own to deal with iron dwarves, or Brann, or whatever you find. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|7|40}}

== Completion ==
<An image of a dwarf appears as you activate the communicator. It can only be Brann Bronzebeard.>

<From the look on his face, Brann seems shocked to see you and begins gesturing furiously.>

== Notes ==
Mount Frostbite who is just nearby. Use the net to trap any [[iron dwarf]] who attacks you, and use Ice Slick behind you to slow them. You'll eventually arrive at a cave at {{coords|48.0|61.0|Storm Peaks}} where [[Tracker Thulin]] is. Kill him and use the communicator to proceed.
