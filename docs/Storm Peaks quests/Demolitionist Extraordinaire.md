You've got some swift feet on you <sonny/missy>! Thanks for lending a hand with those explosives... I've been waiting to give that invention a good test run for a while!

Go ahead and tell Ricket we should be covered on the magnataur front now... my sappers will clean up any of the remaining baddies.

Thanks again!
