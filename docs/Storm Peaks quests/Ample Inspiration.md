==Objectives==
[[Ricket]] at [[K3]] wants you to retrieve a [[U.D.E.D.|U.D.E.D]], use it to blow up a mammoth, and retrieve 8 Hearty Mammoth Meat.
* [[Hearty Mammoth Meat]] (8)

==Description==
Wow! That stuff is nasty. Not to account for [[gnoll]] taste or anything, but I figured whatever they had would at least be... edible?

Let's get more creative.

[[Tore Rumblewrench|Tore]]'s got an explosive dispenser north of town... not far from the big cavern entrance, can't miss it. I'm sure she intends them for mining purposes of some sort, but I've got a better idea.

Grab one of those things and rush it to one of the nearby [[mammoth]]s... most of them are to the west. Collect the meat, bring it back. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Mammoth Sinew Cinch|Mammoth Hide Galoshes|Wooly Cowl|Polished Tusk Shackles|K3 Pachyderm Prevention Device}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|6|80}}
*21,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I know my plan was brilliant. Don't even worry about it.

Does it feel good to be in the presence of greatness? A little tingly maybe?

==Completion==
And it's already well-done! I outdo myself sometimes.

Thanks much, friend!

==Notes==
Find [[U.D.E.D. Dispenser]] north of K3 at {{Co|42|80|Storm Peaks}} and loot [[U.D.E.D.]]. Use it to kill [[Ironwool Mammoth]]s, which leaves behind [[Mammoth Carcass]]es and [[Mammoth Meat]] that contain [[Hearty Mammoth Meat]].
