'''The Crone's Bargain''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Lok'lira the Crone]] inside the [[Forlorn Mine]] wants you to retrieve the Runes of the Yrkvinn from [[Overseer Syra]].
* [[Runes of the Yrkvinn]]

==Description==
Yes, it must be the green-skinned prisoner you're after... We might be able to help each other.

You're not going to get the [[goblin]] out of here by force. Not alive, anyway.

Among my people I am known as a Yrkvinn, a practitioner of illusions. As you can see, the [[Hyldnir]] have made me their prisoner.

If I had my runes, I could make you go unnoticed among them. Further inside, patrolling the mines, you'll find an overseer named Syra. She has my runes. Retrieve them and we'll talk some more.

==Rewards==
Upon completing this quest, you will have the illusion of a [[Hyldnir]] cast upon you while you are in [[Sifreldar Village]], the [[Forlorn Mine]], or [[Brunnhildar Village]].  This illusion changes how most Hyldnir NPCs/mobs in these regions regard you, from {{reputation|hostile}} to {{reputation|friendly}}.

==Progress==
My runes, <name>? Do you have them?

==Completion==
I wasn't sure you were coming back. I dread to think what will happen to me if I stay here for much longer.
