==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Coin of Ancestry]]

==Completion==
It is good to know the people of this land still pay homage to the olden races. I bid you well, <name>, and offer you this token...

==Notes==
[[Elder Stonebeard]] is located in the [[Storm Peaks]].{{coords|31|38|Storm Peaks}}

If you are on the quest [[The Iron Colossus]] you will not see him due to the [[phasing]]. Abandon the quest, leave the area and then return. Now you will see Elder Stonebeard in the corner of the room.
