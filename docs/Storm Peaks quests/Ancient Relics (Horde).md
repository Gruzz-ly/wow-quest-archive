== Description ==
Welcome to the peaks.

I have a simple request before you head off on whatever grand jaunt you have planned. There are relics and treasures of ancient Ulduar scattered through these mountains. Most are likely in possession of the various sentient races.

Return any that you find to me, and I will reward you in kind. Perhaps I'll even let you partake on my many potent ales. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
| Airy Pale Ale
| Worg Tooth Oatmeal Stout
| q4=2|Snowfall Lager
| q5=2|Drakefire Chile Ale}}
You will also receive: {{cost|6|80}}

== Progress ==
Were you able to find the relics of which I spoke?

== Completion ==
These will do nicely! I am much obliged. Perhaps a drink for your troubles?

== Notes ==
Relics may drop from all mobs in the zone.
