This quest is part of [[the Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Thorim]] wants you to slay Eisenfaust inside the [[Hall of the Shaper]] and Halefnir the Windborn and Duronn the Runeforged in the [[Terrace of the Makers]].
* [[Eisenfaust]] slain
* [[Halefnir the Windborn]] slain
* [[Duronn the Runewrought]] slain

==Description==
The attack on the Terrace of the Makers was not a half-hearted move on [[Loken|my brother's]] behalf. He sent a legion of iron dwarves and some of his most powerful lieutenants.

Use the [[Horn of the Peaks]] to call the [[earthen]] to your side and defeat Loken's servants.

You'll find the giant, Eisenfaust, inside the [[Hall of the Shaper|Halls of the Shaper]] to the north. You'll find the others deeper inside the Terrace of the Makers, beyond the stairs to the northwest. 
* [[Horn of the Peaks]] (provided)
==Progress==
It is good to see you again, <name>.

==Completion==
One by one, my brother's servants have fallen. Loken's insurrection will soon come to an end.

Many people have reported that the quest seems bugged; the Earthen, four [[Oathbound Warder]]s, don't help you fight. They actually work as pets and should have (but often don't have) a pet bar. However, you can use keyboard equivalents for the hidden commands.
*Ctrl-1: Lava Burst: "You hurl molten lava at the target, dealing Fire damage." 150 Mana, 30 yd range, 2 second cast, 2 second cooldown.
*Ctrl-2: Earth's Grasp (root): "Surrounds an enemy in stone, immobilizing it for up to 10 sec." 30 yd range, 1.5 second cast, 12 second cooldown.
*Ctrl-3: Earth Shield: "Protects the target with an earthen shield, causing melee attacks to heal the shielded target. This effect can only occur once every few seconds. 10 charges. Lasts 2 min." 600 Mana, 40 yd range, Instant, 1 minute cooldown.
*Ctrl-4: Earth Shock, which is capable of interrupting spellcasting: "Shocks an enemy with concussive force, inflicting Nature damage and interrupting the spell being cast for 2 sec." 897 Mana, 20 yd range, Instant, 10 second cooldown.

Duronn has an ability that heals him to full.  However, normal methods of cc (including the Warder's Earth Shock) work to interrupt the casting of that ability.
