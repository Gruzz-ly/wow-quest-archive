==Objectives==
Destroy the North Lightning Forge, the Central Lightning Forge, and the South Lightning Forge with [[Bouldercrag's Bomb]]s, then return to [[Bouldercrag the Rockshaper]] at [[Bouldercrag's Refuge]].
* [[North Lightning Forge]] damaged
* [[Central Lightning Forge]] damaged
* [[South Lightning Forge]] damaged
*[[Bouldercrag's Bomb]] (provided)

==Description==
In my folly, I'd thought [[Valduran the Stormborn|Valduran's]] project at [[Narvir's Cradle]], a large construction area to the south, no more than a grotesque monument to [[Loken|"Keeper" Loken's]] cruelty.

Now we know the truth, that it was meant to be used as a weapon against us and our allies. We must not allow this iron colossus to reach completion, <name>, for it will mean the end of the refuge.

Go to Narvir's Cradle, find the lightning forges the stormforged artisans use, and sabotage them. 

==Progress==
Were you able to hamper them by sabotaging the forges?

==Completion==
Excellent work! Oh, it won't stop the iron dwarves, but it'll take them valuable time to rebuild those forges. I daresay we've gained the advantage.

==Notes==
The three forges are all on the ground level in a line about 100 yards apart. They're more west to east than north to south, though.
