==Objectives==
Use a [[Tamed Jormungar]] to defeat the Iron Colossus and return to [[Bouldercrag the Rockshaper]] at [[Bouldercrag's Refuge]].
* [[Iron Colossus]] slain

==Description==
We have failed to prevent the completion of the iron colossus, <name>, which means we have no choice but to face it in battle.

[[Bruor Ironbane|Bruor]] has devised a plan to exploit the colossus' only weakness.

No matter how tough the colossus' armor is, it is still vulnerable to acid. Bruor's men have captured and trained a number of adult jormungar. Take control of one using the orbs along the northern edge of the [[Snowdrift Plains]], then search the plains for the colossus and use your jormungar's acid breath against it. 

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Have you defeated the iron colossus and spared the refuge from destruction?

==Completion==
We've done it, we've really done it! The refuge is spared and the stormforged are defeated! We must warn [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]] before [[Loken]] gets it in his mind to rebuild his forces. The only way to secure the victory you have won today is to go to [[Ulduar]] and defeat Loken for all time!

==Notes==
This quest triggers [[phasing]] for the [[Snowdrift Plains]] and [[Narvir's Cradle]] areas.  The usual mobs are removed from both areas.  The Colossus is removed from the scaffolding and wanders through the Plains area, and past the Cradle area.

All along the northern edge of the Snowdrift Plains are [[Jormungar Control Orb]]s, [[Tamed Jormungar]] and [[Earthen Jormungar Handler]]s. Use the orb to mount the jormungar.

Abilities while emerged:
* #1 will submerge the jormungar beneath the surface of the snow and allow it to become mobile
* #2 is a 10-yard ranged attack for 5700-7400
* #3 will spew acid for 3700 and cast a DoT for 1300 every 2 seconds for 15, with a six second cooldown, but is not on the global cooldown.  The DoT stacks up to 5 times.

While submerged, the jormungar is capable of moving through the snow, but cannot attack. Hit 1 to emerge from the ground, rooted. You can start moving the moment you hit submerge, even though the animation hasn't finished going.
 
Submerge, then find the colossus. It has ~330,000 HP, while the jormungar has 50,000. Emerge inside the hitbox so the acid spew will hit and the DoT will tick. Fastest way to kill the colossus is to hit 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, repeat.

The colossus casts a ground slam, which does 15,000 damage in front of the colossus. The cast time is ten seconds, so if he starts to cast it, submerge and either get out of range (which isn't too far) or get behind him.

If you pull him too far from his route he evades.

He will start to attack you while you are submerged when you enter his melee range.

When the jormungar submerges or emerges, it seems to like to change direction so be wary when trying to run through the Colossus to avoid ground slam. Holding down right-mouse helps.
