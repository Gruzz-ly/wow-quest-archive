'''The Drakkensryd''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Use the [[Hyldnir Harpoon]] to defeat 10 Hyldsmeet Drakeriders at the [[Temple of Storms]]. Use the Hyldnir Harpoon on a [[Column Ornament]] to exit the Drakkensryd and speak to [[Thorim]] when you've succeeded.
* [[Hyldsmeet Drakerider]] Defeated (10)

==Description==
This is it. You've passed all the tests of the Hyldsmeet... all but one. You've risen among our sisters' best and fiercest.

The final test is at hand. The Drakkensryd - the true test of a Hyldnir's worth and warrior spirit. It'll be you, your riding drake, a chained harpoon and a score of your sisters vying for dominance.

Show no quarter. None will be expected.

==Progress==
Begone!

==Completion==
Sif... is that you?

==Notes==
Accepting the quest will put players on a [[Hyldsmeet Proto-Drake]] on a flight to the Temple of Storms.  The Proto-Drake is a vehicle that only provides a "leave vehicle" button. As most of the flight on the Proto-Drake is exceedingly high in the air, one is advised to have some method of slow-fall available in case you fall off the drake. Climbing on a drake will dismiss your pet, and pets cannot be summoned while on drakes.

Once circling the Temple of Storms, use the harpoon to jump from drake to drake, killing hyldnir along the way. The fastest option is to jump to an occupied drake and fight hand-to-hand with its current rider. Another option is to attack hyldnir on other drakes using ranged attacks, which is generally much slower, as drake riders generally only come into range for a few seconds at a time, however it may be your best option if you're doing the quest as a hunter, since the only alternative is fighting them in melee with no pet and no traps.

It is possible to use bandages while on the mount, however it is impossible to eat or drink.

It is also possible to shapeshift as a [[Druid]].

Around the Temple of Storms, the columns have ornaments on them. Look up and to the left (at the columns), target a column, and ''use'' the harpoon to get up on the temple. If you run low on health, you can use the harpoon on an ornament to reach the temple, eat there and then use the harpoon again to get on a drake.

==Trivia==
The word "Drakkensryd" seems to have a Germanic etymology (word origin). It is similar to English ''dragon ride'' and Dutch ''drakenrit''. That is actually what this quest is about. The purpose is to ride on a dragon and attack mobs as explained [[#Notes|above]].
