==Objectives==
[[Thorim]] wants you to listen to his story.
* Thorim's History Heard

==Description==
Sif? Is it truly you?

No? A <race>? But for a moment....

Enough of this! The visions of my Sif have tormented me for far too long. It is time for me to avenge her, and to bring honor to her memory.

My brother must pay! 

==Progress==
Hear my words, <race>.

==Completion==
You now know a bit of the history of this land... my land.

I call upon you to assist me in setting these wrongs to right.

==Notes==
:Speak, <class>.

:{{gossip|Can you tell me what became of Sif?}}

::For a moment I thought you were my beloved Sif... that strand of hair... but no! It can't be... Sif is dead....

::My... my brother.... killed her!

::{{gossip|He did more than that, [[Thorim]]. He controls [[Ulduar]] now.}}

:::Ulduar... I was sworn to protect Ulduar.

:::Sworn to protect the [[Terrace of the Makers]].

:::Sworn to protect the pacts between the [[Frostborn|races]] [[Hyldnir|of]] [[Frost giant|frost]].

:::But I failed! I let my brother trick me. I let him turn me against my allies. He tricked me into blaming Sif's death on a dear friend, Arngrim, the king of the [[frost giant]]s.

:::After I realized what I'd done... I... gave in to dispair{{sic}}.

:::{{gossip|It needn't end this way.}}

::::Who are you, little one? To come speak these words to the mighty Thorim...

::::I should... crush you!

::::Yet, you've delivered me from my stupor. Your presence here is a sign!

::::It was no accident that I mistook you for Sif. What would she think of me? I must prepare for battle.

::::I must avenge her death and liberate the [[titan]]s' sacred grounds from my brother's madness!
