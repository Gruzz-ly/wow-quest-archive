==Objectives==
[[Jeer Sparksocket]] at [[K3]] would like Sparksocket's Tools retrieved from [[Sparksocket Minefield|his minefield]].
*[[Sparksocket's Tools]]

==Description==
Blast it! Where are my tools? I had them here just a moment ago.

Oh! I probably forgot them when I was setting up that minefield in the west. That's mildly inconvenient. I'd be quite appreciative if you could go get them for me. You'll need to watch your step though... you should be able to use the same path that I did to get out.

Oh, and don't try to fly in... I had the presence of mind to set up turrets to shoot down anything that might fly, and they aren't very discerning in who they target.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|80}}

==Progress==
If [[Janks]] were here, I could have just sent him on this errand. Oh... on second thought... I'm not sure I told him where the safe path is anyway.

Good thing I have you resourceful adventure types around, eh?

==Completion==
Ha ha! These are them! Thank you kindly. I hope you didn't have too much trouble traversing the field.

==Notes==
Don't use your flying mount close to the mine field! If you get dismounted by the AA guns and land in the mine field you're going to be ping-ponged until you die or you land outside of it. You've got a second or two if you're close to a mine to try to run away from it so you can try to use the knockback to your advantage.

The tools are "guarded" by Janks in the center of the field.

The "path" starts by the southernmost "Danger" sign to the southeast of the mine field. Head into the field, turn south and follow the ridge in to the center.
