==Objectives==
[[Thyra Kvinnshal]] in [[Brunnhildar Village]] wants you to go to [[Valkyrion]] and obtain [[Vial of Frost Oil]] from the [[Valkyrion Aspirant]]s. Use the Vials of Frost Oil to destroy 30 Plagued Proto-Drake Eggs.
* [[Plagued Proto-Drake Egg]] (30)

==Description==
The [[Lich King]] sent emissaries to us on three different occasions. All three were promptly dismembered.

Our sisters in Valkyrion were not as dedicated to our traditions and accepted the [[Scourge]]'s advances. Now instead of capturing their drakes from the wild, they raise them from the blight and filth that the Scourge wallow in.

Take the frost oil that the Valkyrion [[Hyldnir]] carry on them and use it to freeze any blighted eggs you find. Rumors speak of a fetid pool of blight where the eggs are kept. 

==Progress==
Did you destroy the blighted eggs?

==Completion==
You have our thanks, sister. We cannot allow our valiant traditions to be corrupted.

== Notes ==
The Plagued Proto-drake eggs are in an orange pool at the west end of Valkyrion.  Can't miss 'em.
