'''A Monument to the Fallen''' is part of a side chain to [[the Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[King Jokkum]] wants you to bring Hodir's Horn Fragments to [[Njormeld]] in [[Dun Niffelem]].
* [[Horn Fragments]] (Provided)

==Description==
Bring these fragments to Njormeld. He will use the pieces of that sacred relic in the construction of a mighty monument.

May it soothe the pains and heal the scars my people have borne these many years.

May its presence help to bring about a new age that sees us once again in glorious battle at [[Thorim]]'s side.

Go now, <class>. Njormeld awaits you. 

==Progress==
You have brought the fragments of Hodir's Horn, <race>?

==Completion==
<Njormeld's eyes become noticeably moist as he pours the contents of the bag onto the anvil.>

The Horn of Hodir...

This was a sacred gift to our people from Hodir himself, <race>. It is a relic of great importance to us.

When you next return to our stronghold you shall see the fruits of your labor.

Farewell.
