==Objectives==
[[Tracker Val'zij]] wants you to slay [[Gimorak]] inside [[Gimorak's Den]].
* [[Gimorak]] slain

==Description==
I should manage for now, <name>. There is one favor I'd like to ask, though.

I would never had fallen to one of these worms, but my [[wind serpent]], [[Heesha]], was killed by the meanest [[worg]] I've seen in some time.

Don't worry about me now, I'll feel better when that worg is breathing no more. You should find him deeper in the cave.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Boots of the Howling Winds
|Hardened Whipping Belt
|Broken Chastity Belt
|Jawbreakers}}
You will also receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Completion==
I'm already feeling much better, mon.  Not sure if it's the antidote or the news of that filthy worg getting what he deserved.

==Progression==
