This quest is part of [[the Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Thorim]], at the [[Terrace of the Makers]], wants you to use the [[Horn of the Peaks]] and call on the [[Earthen]] to defeat 20 [[Iron dwarf|Iron Dwarves]] and 7 Iron Sentinels.
* [[Iron Sentinel]] slain (7)
* [[Iron Dwarf Assailant]] slain (20)

==Description==
For years I neglected my duties, giving into defeat and self-pity.

Not the brave earthen, however. Their oath to protect the Terrace of the Makers with their lives has gone unbroken.

Even now, they fight the corruption of iron with bravery and selflessness, waiting for the moment in which the tides turn.

That moment has arrived. We must rally what remains of the earthen defenders and lead them into a glorious victory. Sound the Horn of the Peaks to call them to your side and take back the Terrace of the Makers. 
* [[Horn of the Peaks]] (provided)

==Progress==
Hail, <name>! What news do you bring?

==Completion==
It's a good start. But my brother's forces will not take long to regroup. We must make our victory a decisive one.

==Notes==
[[Loken's Lackeys]] is usually done at the same time as this one.  Both quests allow use of the [[Horn of the Peaks]].

The horn summons four [[Oathbound Warder]]s to do your bidding. (q.v.) They target whoever you target, and have abilities that vary from immobilizing the foe to causing melee damage to heal you, to simply causing damage to your targets.

It is advisable to use the horn again after having defeated a sentinel, or one of the mobs for the quest [[Loken's Lackeys]].  Defeating a sentinel requires the earthen taking some amount of damage, which could leave you alone against an elite mob.

Both [[Iron Dwarf Assailant]] and [[Iron Dwarf Magus]] count for this quest.

Presumably this quests could be completed without summoning the warders, but where is the fun in that?
