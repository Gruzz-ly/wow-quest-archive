==Objectives==
Take the Dark Armor Plate to [[Mimir's Workshop]] and ask [[Attendant Tock]] to examine it. When you're finished, return to [[Bruor Ironbane]] at [[Bouldercrag's Refuge]].
*Armor plate investigated
*[[Dark Armor Plate (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
The presence of that armor plate is disorienting, but we need to find out all we can from it. It could be part of one of [[Valduran the Stormborn|Valduran's]] schemes.

He's dedicated an extraordinary amount of effort to mining, refining, smithing, and testing this metal.

To the east, along the northern mountain face, is a building called Mimir's Workshop. It hasn't been used in quite some time, but if we're lucky, some of its attendants are still functional. Take your armor plate there and learn what you can from it.

==Progress==
What did you learn?

==Completion==
<Bruor listens as you describe what you learned in the workshop.>

So Valduran's master has given him this sinister metal to construct a giant weapon? That must be what he intends to use for the final strike against us! We need to stop him before he's able to complete it and unleash this weapon.

:{{text|say|Attendant Tock|Metallic specimen of foreign origin detected.}}
:{{text|say|Attendant Tock|Beginning analysis...}}
:''Attendant Tock jumps up on the huge anvil and goes to work on the sample.''
:{{text|say|Attendant Tock|Specimen identified as an alloy of [[saronite]] and [[iron]].}}
:{{text|say|Attendant Tock|The ore used in this sample originated deep wihin the crust of [[Azeroth]] and was recently unearthed.}}
:{{text|say|Attendant Tock|The saronite in this sample is nearly pure. Ores like this do not occur naturally on the surface of Azeroth.}}
:{{text|say|Attendant Tock|This ore can only have been created by a powerful, malevolent force. Attempting to access databanks for more information...}}
:{{text|say|Attendant Tock|Access denied?!}}
:{{text|say|Attendant Tock|Further information can only be accessed from the archives within [[Ulduar]], by order of [[Loken|Keeper Loken]].}}
:{{text|say|Attendant Tock|But one thing is for certain: this plate's size, thickness, and bolt holes point to a use as armor for a colossal structure.}}
:''Attendant Tock jumps down.''
:{{text|say|Attendant Tock|Directive completed. Returning to standby mode.}}
