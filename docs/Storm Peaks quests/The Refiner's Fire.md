'''The Refiner's Fire''' is part of [[the Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
You must collect 10 Furious Sparks from the [[Seething Revenant]]s at [[Frostfield Lake]] and then use the anvil at [[Fjorn's Anvil]].
* [[Furious Spark]]: (10)
* [[Slag Covered Metal]] (Provided)

==Description==
Beneath its porous exterior, this hunk of metal gleams with a mysterious quality.

You feel it would only be prudent to burn off the slag at Fjorn's Anvil.

As you ponder where in this frozen waste you might find something hot enough for the job, a [[fire revenant]] crosses your path... 

==Progress==
The surface of the anvil is scalding, in sharp contrast with the wintry air.

==Completion==
You place the metal on the anvil and immediately upon adding the sparks they work the ore furiously.

When at last they burn out, you are left with a large piece of metal that gleams with a light of its own.

== Notes ==
The Slag Covered Metal that starts this quest is looted from the [[Stormforged Iron Giant]]s that are slain for the quest [[Mending Fences]].  It is convenient but not required to complete this quest before returning to Thorim at the Temple of Storms.
