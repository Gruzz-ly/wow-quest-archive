==Objectives==
[[Fjorlin Frostbrow]] at [[Frosthold]] wants you to obtain 8 slabs of [[Fresh Ice Rhino Meat]] and use them to feed the Stormcrest Eagles above town.
* [[Stormcrest Eagle]]s fed (8)

==Description==
Fresh blood! Good to meet ya! I've got some work if you've got some time.

Off to the east are the [[Foot Steppes]]... pretty hard land, but there's quite a group of rhino that graze there. Our birds have a taste for that rhino meat, but it's always a bit dangerous for them to go hunting with all of the [[proto-dragon|proto-drakes]] that nest around there.

If you're keen, head over that way and get some rhino meat, bring it back to the peaks above here, and then use it to feed some of the eagles that nest there. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Boots of the Howling Winds|Hardened Whipping Belt|Broken Chastity Belt|Jawbreakers}}

==Progress==
These birds have been loyal to use for a long time... we get on pretty well.

==Completion==
Thank you kindly... and I'm sure they're quite appreciative too. They'll make powerful allies; you'll be well off being on this side of their graces.

==Notes==
* The eagles are on the mountain peak further up the slope from [[Frosthold]]. Your character will toss a slab of meat to a resting eagle nearby. You can toss the meat while mounted.
* The [[Foot Steppes]] are the area surrounding the [[Engine of the Makers]] near the center of [[The Storm Peaks]].
* [[Fresh Ice Rhino Meat]] can be looted from any of the Rhino beasts in the area, including [[Ice Steppe Bull]] and [[Ice Steppe Rhino]]
* Some add-ons may inaccuratly give tooltip notes that [[Rhino Meat]] can be used for completion of this quest.
