==Objectives==
Gather 6 [[Inventor's Disk Fragment]] and use them to assemble the Inventor's Disk. Use [[Brann's Communicator]] to contact [[Brann Bronzebeard]] when you have the Inventor's Disk.

If you lose Brann's Communicator, speak to [[Archaeologist Andorin]] at [[Frosthold]] to replace it.
* [[The Inventor's Disk]]

==Description==
Thank the [[Light]] that someone got my message. Now that I'm safe from the [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]], I need to ask your help with something. I've got a lead on [[Norgannon]]'s keystone, which guards access to [[Ulduar]]'s archives, but the [[Titans]] divided it into two pieces and secreted them away.

One of the pieces, the keystone's shell, is held within [[the Inventor's Library]] on the northern coast, south of Ulduar itself. The first thing you'll need to do is retrieve the fragments of an access disk from the library's guardians. 

==Progress==
Did you complete the disk?

==Completion==
Wonderful! Now that we have the disk, you must use it to open the Inventor's vault!

==Notes==
The center of the patio of [[The Inventor's Library]] is at {{coords|38.1|43.2|Storm Peaks}}, south of the [[Temple of Wisdom]] on the mainland. Kill the [[Library Guardian]]s to loot the six Disk Fragments.
