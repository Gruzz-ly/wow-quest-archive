==Objectives==
[[Njormeld]] wants you to take the Reforged Armor to [[Thorim]] at the [[Temple of Storms]].
* [[Reforged Armor of the Stormlord]] (Provided)

==Description==
It remains uncertain whether or not our people can ever rekindle the affection we once held for Thorim.

May this armor, if nothing else, remind him of the days when we stood together in honor, invincible. 

==Progress==
How have your efforts fared, <class>?

==Completion==
<As you present Thorim with the reforged suit of armor, he is visibly stricken by its splendor.>

You have done well, <race>, but there remains much to be done.
