== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Khaliisi]] at the foot of the mountain east of the [[Grom'arsh Crash-Site]].

== Description ==
In order to track down [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]], we're going to need a creature with a keen sense of smell and a good tracking ability. There weren't any hounds on the zeppelin, but I think I have a substitute.

After the crash, I sent Khaliisi down the east face of the mountain to start hunting for food. Her cat, [[Frostbite (frostsaber)|Frostbite]], excels at tracking prey in the snow. Tell her that she'll have to part with her companion for a while, at least. She can hunt on her own, but we have no other way of catching up to Brann Bronzebeard. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||74}}

== Completion ==
So Boktar has volunteered Frostbite for an errand, eh? Well, this had better be important. He knows better than to try to separate a hunter from her pet!

== Notes ==
Khaliisi is found at {{coords|40.8|51.2|Storm Peaks}}.
