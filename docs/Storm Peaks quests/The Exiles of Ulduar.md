This breadcrumb is offered by Brann after completing Norgannon's Shell.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Bouldercrag the Rockshaper]] at [[Bouldercrag's Refuge]]. 

==Description==
The [[Storm Peaks]] are an intriguing place, but there's far more here than [[titan]] ruins. The peoples who live here face a dire threat in [[Loken]] and his minions.

He sent his favorite servants, the [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]], on a brutal campaign against all the creatures of stone. He expelled the earthen from [[Ulduar]], forcing them to take shelter at Bouldercrag's Refuge, on the face of a mountain west of the [[Inventor's Library]]. Bouldercrag and his brethren are beset by the iron dwarves there. Find and help them, <name>. 

==Completion==
So you know [[Brann Bronzebeard]], then? He is our closest ally among those of the flesh. We are as brothers in the struggle against Loken and his followers, in the struggle for Ulduar.
