==Objectives==
Return to [[Captain Tread Sparknozzle]] in [[New Tinkertown]].

==Description==
That was a close one, but we managed to defeat [[Telzo Sparkspanner|Sparkspanner]]! [[Gnome|Gnomanity]] and [[Azeroth]] are saved from a threat they didn't even know about.

Hopefully, that's the last time we'll hear from any of [[Sicco Thermaplugg|Thermaplugg]]'s old goons.

We should return to Captain Sparknozzle. He will want a full report.

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Heritage of Gnomeregan]]

You will also receive:
*[[G.E.A.R. Tracking Beacon]]
* {{cost|11|70|}}
* 8,950 [[XP]]

==Completion==
At attention, soldier!

==Notes==
[[File:G.E.A.R. Up - Teleporter.jpg|thumb|upright|The Teleporter allowing transportation out of the dungeon]]
You can use the nearby Teleporter to quickly leave the [[Halls of Stone]], but this will only bring you to just outside the dungeon entrance. You'll have to make your way back to New Tinkertown on your own. When you arrive, Captain Sparknozzle is still standing atop the same platform where you left him. Upon completion:
:{{Text|say|Captain Tread Sparknozzle|Rangers! You have more than proven gnomish aerial might. The [[Alliance]] will no doubt call upon [[Gnomish Elite Aerial Rangers|G.E.A.R.]] in the future.}}
:{{Text|say|Captain Tread Sparknozzle|But first! Every elite unit requires a proper uniform! Wear the colors of [[Gnomeregan (kingdom)|Gnomeregan]] with pride, ranger!}}

Congratulations! You have now earned the [[Heritage of Gnomeregan]] set.
