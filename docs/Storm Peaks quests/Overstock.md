==Objectives==
[[Ricket]] at [[K3]] wants you to use [[:Improved Land Mines]] at [[Garm's Bane]] to fend off the attackers from [[Garm (subzone)|Garm]]. Both [[Garm Invader]]s and [[Snowblind Follower]]s will count towards this goal.
* Garm Invader slain (12)

==Description==
Hey there again! You didn't run off like all the other adventurers did? Well, you're just a peach, aren't ya? I was beginning to think I smelled funny or something!

We could still use a bit of a hand around here, and you have just the right experience. Remember those [[magnataur]]? Well apparently the cave didn't completely collapse... there are still quite a few left. So much for Gino taking care of them eh?

Fortunately, [[Jeer Sparksocket|Jeer]] made way more than enough mines. You've got this! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|80}} ({{cost|12|96}} at 80)

==Progress==
Boom! Ha ha!

==Completion==
I like you. In fact, you rock!

Yay for you!

==Progression==
