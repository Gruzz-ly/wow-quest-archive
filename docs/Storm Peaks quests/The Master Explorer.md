==Objectives==
Bring Norgannon's Core to [[Brann Bronzebeard]] in the [[Engine of the Makers]].
* [[Norgannon's Core]] (Provided)

==Description==
Combining the keystone will require Norgannon's Binding - a device located in the Engine of the Makers, the large pit beside us. Brann should be down there with the other half of the keystone now. I have instructed him on the use of the device. He awaits your presence.

I will do what I can to keep the [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] occupied, but I do not have confidence that I will hold them for long. [[Yorg Stormheart|King Stormheart]] is returning to the defense of Frosthold with some of his men shortly. Please hurry, <race>. 

==Progress==
Hey there, <lad/lass>! Good to meet ya in person. Did you find it?

==Completion==
You're brilliant, <lad/lass>! Brilliant! This will be a glorious day indeed.

Quickly, hand me the core before those iron dwarves make their way down here.

==Progression==
