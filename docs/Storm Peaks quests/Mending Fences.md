'''Mending Fences''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
[[Thorim]] at the [[Temple of Storms]] wants you to Kill Fjorn and 5 Stormforged Iron Giants at [[Fjorn's Anvil]], east of [[Dun Niffelem]].

Using [[Thorim's Charm of Earth]] will summon his [[Earthen]] to fight by your side. The charm requires a [[Granite Boulder]] from nearby Fjorn's Anvil.
* [[Fjorn]] slain
* [[Stormforged Iron Giant|Stormforged Iron Giants]] slain (5)

==Description==
If I hope to wrest control of the [[Terrace of the Makers|Temple of the Makers]] from my brother, I must make amends with my old allies.

Perhaps by eliminating a common enemy, we may at least take a step towards renewing my friendship with the frost giants.

Fjorn has besieged Dun Niffelem with giants of iron. You must defeat him at Fjorn's Anvil, far to the east of here, and weaken his forces sufficiently for the [[Sons of Hodir]] to emerge victorious.

Take this charm, <name>. Use it to summon my earthen to your aid.

==Progress==
Does Fjorn yet live, <class>?

==Completion==
So it is done then.

Let us hope it is enough.

==Notes==
Loot a granite boulder, then use the charm of earth to throw it at a giant. 4-5 earthen will be summoned and can tank the elite, (and will taunt!), but not kill it for you.

The named works the same way. May want to use two boulders instead of just one to make the fight easier.

Do not, under any circumstances, aggro the elites without earthen assistance. Cloth wearers will die in 3 hits.

The [[Slag Covered Metal]] will drop, starting the next quest in [[the Sons of Hodir quest chain]] [[The Refiner's Fire]].  As ''The Refiner's Fire'' requires actions at [[Fjorn's Anvil]], it should be done before turning this quest in.

== Patch changes ==
