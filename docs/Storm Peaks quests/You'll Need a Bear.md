'''You'll Need a Bear''' is part of [[The Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Brijana]] outside [[Brunnhildar Village]]. 

==Description==
You've succeeded in the first rounds of the Hyldsmeet. To advance further, you're going to need a warbear of your own.

Unfortunately, the [[Hyldnir]] don't give them out to just anyone. You'll have to emerge victorious from true battle, not just gladiatorial combat.

The Hyldnir of Brunnhildar are currently involved in a feud against the [[Sons of Hodir]], Thorim's former allies. Speak to Brijana just outside the village and see how you can help them and prove yourself in the process. 

==Completion==
Think we'll give you your own bear just like that? You'll have to prove yourself before you'll get anything from us.

Do not think too highly of yourself just because you bested a few challengers in the Hyldsmeet.

==Notes==
Brijana and Icefang are just outside the village at {{coords|53.2|65.7|Storm Peaks}}
