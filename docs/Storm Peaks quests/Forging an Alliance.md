This quest is part of [[the Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
You are to go to [[Dun Niffelem]] and ask [[King Jokkum]] to allow [[Thorim]]'s armor to be reforged. After completing [[Jokkum]]'s task, you are to speak with [[Njormeld]] in Dun Niffelem.
* [[Fjorn's Anvil]] Brought to Dun Niffelem
* [[Refined Gleaming Ore]] (provided)

==Description==
<Thorim, for the first time since your meeting him, smiles.>

This is all beginning to have the smell of fate's hand, <race>.

Your discovery is what remains of my armor, long ago cast off in a fit of grief and left to the elements. Only the [[sons of Hodir]] are capable of its reforging, for they are its original creators.

Perhaps you've done enough to soften their hatred of me. Seek out their king, Jokkum, if he still breathes.

Find your way into his good graces and plead for his assistance. 

==Rewards==

==Completion==
It would seem that I have refined my technique considerably. That, or the legends surrounding this anvil are true.

This suit of armor is superior to the last, and took less material to create.

With the excess, I was able to fashion you a little something as payment for your assistance.

==Notes==
King Jokkum starts [[You Can't Miss Him]], which is a mandatory side quest. Do it in order to complete this one.

Njormeld can be found by the anvil at the western end of Dun Niffelem.
