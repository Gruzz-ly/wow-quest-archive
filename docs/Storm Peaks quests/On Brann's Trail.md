==Objectives==
Retrieve the Burlap-Wrapped Note from [[Abandoned Camp|Brann's camp]] and return it to [[Archaeologist Andorin]] at [[Frosthold]].
* [[Burlap-Wrapped Note]]

==Description==
After the discovery of [[Brann Bronzebeard's Journal|Brann's journal]] in [[Grizzly Hills]], we've only had one other communication from [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]]. A mysterious note found its way to [[Explorers' League]] headquarters in [[Ironforge]], with no indication of where it came from. All it said was that we're to meet Brann at his camp and help him with his search.

From what I can tell, the camp should be located northeast of here, across the [[Bor's Breath]] River and at the foot of some ruins from the [[Path of the Titans]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
*22050 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find Brann's camp?

==Completion==
<Archaeologist Andorin looks at you expectantly.>

You were supposed to come back with Brann, not a piece of paper. What's going on here?

==Notes==
Fly northeast out of Frosthold to the [[Bor's Breath]] valley. Keep flying east to {{co|36.4|64.1|Storm Peaks}} as the river turns south to find the [[Abandoned Camp]] full of [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]]. A pile of [[Disturbed Snow]] can be found by the trees just west of the ruins of the [[Path of the Titans]] by the cliff's edge {{coords|36.1|64.1|Storm Peaks}}. Loot it to recover the Burlap-Wrapped Note.

On completion:
:{{text|say|Archaeologist Andorin|It's those blasted iron dwarves again! Somehow, they found him before we did.}}
:{{text|say|Archaeologist Andorin|They're not going to give up until they find him. We can't allow that to happen, <name>, and Brann knows it.}}
:{{text|say|Archaeologist Andorin|There are some rather cryptic instructions in this note. Brann must've had some kind of backup plan, but he can't keep evading capture forever...}}
:{{text|say|Archaeologist Andorin|It's up to you to find him before the irons do!}}
