{{questportrait|Essence of Hati Storm Peaks.jpg|Essence of Hati|Absorb Hati's essence in order to save his life!}}
==Objectives==
Absorb Hati's essence into the Thunderspark at the [[Temple of Storms]].

* Speak to [[Grif Wildheart]] at the Temple of Storms
* [[Hati]]'s [[Essence of Hati (Strom Peaks)|Essence]] absorbed
* Rendezvous with [[Thorim]]
* [[Thunderspark]] (provided)

==Description==
Through the glorious wonder of science, I have managed to keep the Thunderspark powered precisely for this purpose.

All you need to do is get to the Temple of Storms and absorb Hati's essence into it. Just... kind of point it in his general direction.

Oh, and do keep in mind that this is only one part of Hati. You may run into a few... technical difficulties before he's subdued enough for the absorption protocol.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
One down, one tae go!

==Notes==
;Quest accept
:{{Text|say|Image of Mimiron|It seems Hati's essence has gathered at locations where he performed great sacrifices in life. Get to the Temple of Storms right away!}}

;Temple of Storms
:''An [[Essence of Hati (Storm Peaks)|Essence of Hati]] is seen going at the dead bodies of [[Thunderous Proto-Drake]]s and [[Raging Stormrider]]s. Thorim has been incapacitated by {{Abilities|Thundering Howl|id=290720|icon=spell_shaman_staticshock}}.

:{{Text|say|Thorim|Hati... is that you?}}
:{{Text|say|Grif Wildheart|Not to worry, Thorim, we've got yer back!}}

;Grif Thunderheart
:Careful, <lad/lass>! Somethin' ain't right.

:{{Gossip|I'm ready.}}

::{{Text|say|Grif Wildheart|Hati! Come 'ere, boy!}}
::''Hati begins approaching.''
::{{Text|say|Grif Wildheart|Hah! He remembers us!}}
::{{Text|say|Grif Wildheart|No... somethin's wrong. What is it, boy?}}
::''The essence of Hati becomes hostile. Grif [[Disengage|disengages]] and assists the hunter [[adventurer]].''
::{{Text|say|Grif Wildheart|I know yer in there, Hati. We're here tae help ye!}}
::{{Text|say|Grif Wildheart|I think we're breakin' through! Keep it up, <name>!}}
::{{Text|emote|Hati's essence recognizes you and becomes confused!}}
::{{Text|say|Grif Wildheart|That's it! Use the Thunderspark tae absorb Hati's essence!}}

Use Thunderspark while the essence is in Cacaphonic Delirium to start Absorbing.

:{{Text|say|Thorim|Ah, Bronzebeard and <name>! It is good to see you once more!}}
:{{Text|say|Grif Wildheart|For the love o'... aye, 'tis good to see ye again as well, Thorim.}}
:{{Text|say|Grif Wildheart|The rest of Hati's essence is in [[Silithus]]. If we can capture it, [[Mimiron]] thinks we can reform him!}}
:{{Text|say|Thorim|Restore Hati? Why did you not say so before?! I will join you in Silithus at once!}}
:''Thorim immediately leaves in a flash of lightning.''
:{{Text|say|Grif Wildheart|I suppose we'll just figure out the plan later. Let's get movin'!}}
