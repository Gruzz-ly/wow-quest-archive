'''A Spark of Hope''' is part of [[the Sons of Hodir quest chain]].

==Objectives==
You are to bring the Refined Gleaming Ore to [[Thorim]] in the [[Temple of Storms]].
* [[Refined Gleaming Ore]] (Provided)

==Description==
Clearly, this is more than an ordinary hunk of metal.

Unlike any ore you're familiar with, it is hard but not brittle, far lighter than it looks, and glows even when cool.

Looking closer, you can make out one of Thorim's runes shining beneath the surface.... 

==Progress==
What do you have there, little one?

==Completion==
You notice Thorim's stern countenance brighten with recognition as you present the ore.

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 3.3.0|comment=reputation gain increased from 22,000 to 28,600 (for non-humans).  Where this formerly increased reputation to {{reputation|Neutral}} with the [[Sons of Hodir]], it now makes one {{reputation|Honored}}.}}
