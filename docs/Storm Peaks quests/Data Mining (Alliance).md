==Objectives==
Use the Inventor's Disk to retrieve 7 pieces of Hidden Data from the [[Databank]]s. Use [[Brann's Communicator]] to contact [[Brann Bronzebeard]] once you've completed this task.

If you lose Brann's Communicator, speak to [[Archaeologist Andorin]] at [[Frosthold]] to replace it.
* Hidden Data gathered (7)
* [[The Inventor's Disk]] (Provided)

==Description==
That disk you assembled... it's blank! That crafty [[Mimir]] must've hidden the information somewhere else. Look around the Inventor's Library; do you see any databanks there?

That might be what you need to do with the disk. Try using it near some of those databanks. Perhaps it's set to retrieve and store information from them. After you've tried your hand at that, contact me again and let me know what you've found. Meanwhile, I'll be trying to track down the other half of the archive key. 

==Progress==
Did you try using the disk? What did you find?

==Completion==
<Brann looks at the disk as you hold it up.>

I can't tell if there's anything stored there or not! You have to tell me what happened.

<You describe the data retrieval process.>

So it worked? At least we can count on Mimir to be systematic. Can't say that for the rest of these Keepers from what I've been hearing...

==Notes==
There are more than 8 [[Databank]]s in the surrounding area , so it will NOT take any respawns to get all 7 data collection. Unless several other have already just been there.
