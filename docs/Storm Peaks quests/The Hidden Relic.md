==Objectives==
[[Creteus]] in the [[Foot Steppes]] has provided you with the information to locate [[Norgannon's Core]]. 

==Description==
During your absence, I was privileged enough to parley with the [[dwarf]] [[Brann Bronzebeard]]. This dwarf indicated his purpose for seeking the keystone, and I am satisfied that it is for satisfactory intent... I believe this dwarf may be the entity for which the keystone was created.

Norgannon's Core is located in [[the Frigid Tomb]] to the southeast. Its guardians are ancient beings of ice, and they will not welcome your presence. Best these guardians and retrieve the keystone with my blessing, <race>. 

==Completion==
<As the chest opens, air rushes out into the chamber, carrying with it the musty smell of something that has been here for countless years. Norgannon's Core rests in the bottom of the chest, undisturbed by the ages.

==Notes==
Just to the southeast of the Engine of the Makers is a cave full of [[ice revenants]].

At the bottom of the cave is [[The Guardian's Charge]], guarded by an [[Eternal Watcher]].

==Progression==
{{Sniffing Out the Perpetrator}}
