==Objectives==
Use the [[Telluric Poultice]] to heal 8 Fallen Earthen Defenders, then return to [[Bouldercrag the Rockshaper]] at [[Bouldercrag's Refuge]].
* [[Fallen Earthen Defender]]s healed (8)

==Description==
The refuge's defenders fight bravely, but they cannot keep up with the iron onslaught.

With the earth you collected, I can make bandages to help heal the wounds of some of the fallen. The more defenders we can patch up, the longer we'll last out there.

Take these poultices and use them to heal the wounds of the fallen defenders outside the refuge. Get as many back into the battle as possible, <name>. Every casualty is one too many. 

==Progress==
Have you healed the fallen defenders?

==Completion==
The warriors that you've healed will aid us in holding the line even longer. If we are to truly be free of the iron threat, we must find a way to strike at them behind the lines.

==Notes==
Healing a fallen defender will turn him into a [[Rejuvenated Defender]], acting as a guardian.
