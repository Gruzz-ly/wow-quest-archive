==Objectives==
[[Gino]] at [[Garm's Rise]] wants you to plant the Hardpacked Explosive Bundle near [[Frostgut's Altar]], kill Tormar Frostgut, and then escape the cave before it collapses on you.
* Place Explosive Bundle
* [[Tormar Frostgut]] slain
* [[Hardpacked Explosive Bundle]] (provided)

==Description==
Hey there! Joining us for the assault I assume?

I've got a special task for you... we're going to bring the whole cave down on their heads! Towards the back of their cave, you should find Frostgut's Altar. Sneak up and plant this hardpacked explosive bundle somewhere close to it.

Once the charge is placed, stick around just long enough to make sure Frostgut bites it, then get out quickly! There's no knowing how long the cave will last once that thing goes off! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|6|80}}

==Progress==
That explosive bundle is my baby... it took me weeks to perfect it. WEEKS!

That's a long time... okay.

==Completion==
The whole mountain shook! Was it gorgeous? I bet it was! How could it not be?

And the Inventor's League tells me all of my inventions just blow up. Darn right they do! Hah!

==Notes==
Go in the cave, take a right, and follow the spiraling path all the way to the top of the cave around the water in the center. At the top is the altar and a view into a [[titan]] engine. Once the named is dead, jump down into the water, take a right, then a left to get out.
