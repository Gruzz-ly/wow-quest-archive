==Objectives==
Bring a sprig of Spiritsbreath to [[Sage Paluna]] at [[Camp Oneqwah]].
* [[Spiritsbreath]]

==Description==
[[Scout Vor'takh|Vor'takh]] is right—we cannot allow this opportunity to slip through our fingers.

Fortunately, I think I know of a way to translate the journal of this [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]].

The shamans of the Redfang [[furbolg]]s, who congregate at the [[Heart's Blood Shrine]] south of the camp, grow an herb known as spiritsbreath. An experienced mystic can use incense made from it to seek wisdom from the spirits of the ancestors.

Seek out the shaman known as [[Grumbald One-Eye]]. He should carry the herb for his devotions to [[Ursoc]].

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Have you brought sufficient quantities of the herb?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. I'll prepare the incense and then we'll see what exactly this royal dwarf was doing so far from home.

==Notes==
When completing the quest:
:{{text|say|Sage Paluna|Let us see what this journal reveals.}}
:{{text|say|Sage Paluna|[[Scout Vor'takh]]'s hunch was correct. Brann Bronzebeard visited [[Thor Modan]] recently and this journal records his findings.}}
:{{text|say|Sage Paluna|He managed to explore the ruins before the battle began, discovering three runic plates inscribed with prophecies.}}
:{{text|say|Sage Paluna| Brann doesn't record the translations, but it says he committed them to memory before fleeing the battle.}}
:{{text|say|Sage Paluna|If you can translate those plates, we can find and capture Brann.}}

==Progression==
