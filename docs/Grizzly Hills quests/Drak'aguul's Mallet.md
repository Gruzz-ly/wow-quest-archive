==Objectives==
[[Kraz]] at [[Harkor's Camp]] wants you to slay [[Drak'aguul]] outside [[Drakil'jin Ruins]] and return with the Drakil'jin Mallet.
* [[Drakil'jin Mallet]]

==Description==
Corruption....

Even before you delivered these jars, Kraz could sense it. This corruption fills the ancient [[Drakkari]] spirits with great angst and prevents them from entering the rest they seek.

Kraz will not lie, <class>. Cleansing this place will require great sacrifice, but we shall speak of that at another time.

There is one among the living here who holds the key to its cleansing. Seek out Drak'aguul and return to Kraz with the mallet he carries.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:{{itembox|
|Bell-Ringer's Shoulderpads
|Waistguard of Expedient Procurement
|Polished Staghorn Helm
|Hammer-Holder's Gauntlets}}
You will also receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
You find the mallet, <name>?

==Completion==
You have done well thus far, <name>, but now comes the true test.

==Notes==
Drak'aguul spawns at {{coords|73.6|29.7|Grizzly Hills}} and patrols the staircase that winds from the ruins down to the shore.  He has a pair of level 73 guards with him.
