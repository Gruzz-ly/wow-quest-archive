==Objectives==
[[Kraz]] at [[Squatter's Camp]] wants you to collect the [[Sacred Drakkari Offering]] from the [[Drakil'jin Ruins]] and use the [[Drakkari Spirit Dust]] on it. You must use the [[Infused Drakkari Offering]] at the gongs outside of [[Drakil'jin Ruins]].
* [[Warlord Jin'arrak]] Destroyed
* [[Drakkari Spirit Dust]] (provided)

==Description==
It is good to see you back among the living. Many who travel the path of the dead do not return to speak of it.

While you were away, a vision appeared to Kraz revealing what remains to be done.

A sacred offering lies somewhere inside the crypt. Take this spirit dust fashioned from the remnants you collected and use it on the offering.

The infused offering will bring an end to the corrupted warlord and will release the many tormented souls.

May the spirits guide your actions, <name>. 

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox|
|Axe of the Warlord's Demise
|Beaked Dagger
|Serrated Cold-Iron Slicer
|Branch of Insightful Dreams
|Jagged Troll Render
|Glowing Voodoo Orb}}
You will also receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Has Jin'arrak been defeated, <name>?

==Completion==
It is done.

Your selflessness has brought eternal peace to many souls, ending eons of misery.

May this act lighten your own soul and lessen your burdens, for I see that there are yet many perils you must face.

Farewell, <name>.

==Notes==
The Sacred Drakkari Offerings are inside the ruins. Once you've created the Infused Drakkari Offerings, use them outside the ruins at the gongs.  Once the Warlord has consumed the infused offering, he will shrink, and then die without your aid.  The various Ancient Drakkari spirits in the crypt will come out and celebrate.

Note that you may get credit for completing this quest if you are close by when someone else completes it.  You need not be grouped with that person; you may even be of the opposing faction.
