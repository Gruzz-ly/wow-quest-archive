==Objectives==
Bring [[Brugar Stoneshear]] at the [[Westfall Brigade Encampment]] a cask of Howlin' Good Moonshine.
* [[Howlin' Good Moonshine]]

==Description==
Our best bet for moving our forces quickly to [[Icecrown Glacier]] lies with the network of tunnels beneath the ancient [[iron dwarf]] city of [[Thor Modan]].

Brugar Stoneshear and his [[Explorers' League]] boys aren't going to be happy, but orders are orders.

The news might go over better if you brought him a cask of that moonshine sold by that trapper, [[Hugh Glass]], down at [[Redwood Trading Post]], southeast of here along the tree line.

Man's not right in the head, but you won't find better moonshine out here. 

==Progress==
What's that you have there? 

==Completion==
Let me get this straight -- a <race> I don't know brings me a cask of the finest booze in this miserable forest. Ok, then, what are you after? 

==Notes==
Hugh Glass is at {{coords|69.1|40.1|Grizzly Hills}}.

;Upon completion
: {{text|say|Brugar Stoneshear|He wants me to do WHAT?}}
: {{text|say|Brugar Stoneshear|Well, he'd better keep the moonshine flowing if he wants my men to stop their research to serve the military's purposes!}}
