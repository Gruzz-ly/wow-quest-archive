==Objectives==
[[Commander Bargok]] wants you to kill 15 [[Alliance]] units or players in [[Blue Sky Logging Grounds|Blue Sky Logging Ground]].
* Alliance units eliminated (15)

==Description==
We've suffered heavy casualties here, <race>.

The only good news is that we've given as much as we've taken. I've requested more troops, but the bulk of our forces are bogged down in [[Venture Bay]]. It looks like we're on our own for now.

No matter how bad it gets, we MUST stand our ground! The precious resources of this region are essential to the Horde's long-term success in [[Northrend]].

We've got to keep the Alliance on their heels until help arrives. Get out there and give 'em something to think about.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:|c={{cost|5|60}}
|q1=10|item1=Venture Coin}}
You will also receive:
*20750 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
Is that Alliance blood on your weapon, <race>?

==Completion==
Fifteen down, eh? Good to hear it, <class>.

If nothing else you've bought us a bit of time - at least a day by my figuring.

Here's your pay.
