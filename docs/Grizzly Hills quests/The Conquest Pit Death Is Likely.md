*Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
I'm gonna shoot straight with ya, kid. This next contender's a murderer.

Literally.

He was to be executed last week, but he strangled the hangman with his left hand, so Krenna's guards sort of let me have him.

Feel free to pass on this one. I wouldn't blame ya. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|17|70}}

==Completion==
Fancy footwork, fancy footwork.  You really made quick work of that crazy orc, friend.

Odds were against you seven-to-one; made some nice coin on that one!
