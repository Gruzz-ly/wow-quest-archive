==Objectives==
[[Drakuru]] wants you to collect the Drakkari Tablets from the [[Drakil'jin Ruins|Ruins of Drakil'jin]] and 5 [[Sacred Mojo]] from [[Drakkari Oracle]]s and [[Drakkari Protector|Protectors]] there. You are then to use [[Drakuru's Elixir]] at [[Drakuru's Brazier]] at the ruins to summon his image.
* [[Drakkari Tablets]]

==Description==
<Drakuru places the [[Eye of the Prophets]] on his brow and the [[Heart of the Ancients]] on his chest.>

We be close, mon, very close!

The Drakkari Tablets be all dat remain ta be found. Nobody be knowin' how old dey be or what dey be sayin', but with the eye and the heart Drakuru can be readin' dem. Dey lie deep inside the crypt at Drakil'jin, due east of here.

Once ya got the tablets, get sacred mojo from the oracles and protectors so ya can summon me there. They'd be proud to be dyin' for such a cause.

==Rewards==
You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| |Wispy Shoulderpads|Helm of Rising Smoke|Plane-shifted Boots|Spiritforged Legguards|Vengeful Spirit Beads}}
You will also receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
Good to be seein' ya, <name>.

You find da tablets?

==Completion==
We've done it, <name>!

We have all of the components we need to perform the cleansing ritual.

==Notes==
The tablets are found in the same room as [[Harrison Jones]].  Since he begins a comparatively easy escort quest ([[Dun-da-Dun-tah!]]), you will likely want to complete that as part of making your way out of the [[Drakil'jin Ruins]].
