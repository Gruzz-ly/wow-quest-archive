==Objectives==
[[Scout Vor'takh]] wants you to travel to [[Zul'Drak]] and report to [[Sergeant Riannah]] at [[Light's Breach]].

[[Makki Wintergale]] in [[Camp Oneqwah]] will provide you transportation.

==Description==
As pressing as our needs are here, there's news from the lands to the north that cannot be ignored.

I've just received a message from the Argent Crusade. It seems that scourge forces are gathering there and are threatening to overrun Zul'drak.

Needless to say, <name>, if that were to happen our struggle here would be meaningless. You must go there and aid the Crusaders in beating back the Lich King's armies.

Speak to Makki when you are ready to travel.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||60}}
*2100 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|26|}} compensation at level 80)

==Completion==
The Light shall prevail!

==Notes==
*This is one of the three breadcrumb quests to [[Light's Breach]]. The other two are located at [[Light's Trust]] in [[Dragonblight]] and at the [[Westfall Brigade Encampment]] in [[Grizzly Hills]]. Only one of the three may be completed.
*This quest cannot be accepted if you already have one of the other 2 breadcrumb quests in your quest log.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
