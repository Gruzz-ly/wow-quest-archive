==Objectives==
[[Sasha]] at the [[White Pine Trading Post]] wants you to take the Tranquilizer Dart and use it on [[Tatjana]] in [[Solstice Village]]. Bring Tatjana back to the White Pine Trading Post.
* Tatjana Delivered{{coords|62.2|42.4|Grizzly Hills}}
* [[Tranquilizer Dart]] (provided)

==Description==
My sister is here somewhere, and I can't seem to get [[Anatoly|this monster]] to talk.

He doesn't seem to care about his own well-being, but I've an idea. I knew Anatoly's wife, [[Tatjana]], from before the [[wolfcult]] arrived—she was a horse-handler.

Take this tranquillizer dart. Bring her back alive, we're going to need her if we're to have any leverage with Anatoly.

I will help you find the person behind all this once we save my sister.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| 
|Solstice Signet
|Tatjana's Pendant
|Seal of the Slumbering Wolf}}

==Progress==
I'm glad to see you in one piece.

==Completion==
That... that was close.

We need to save [[Anya]]. Now!

==Notes==
Use the dart on Tatjana while she's on the horse, then right-click on the horse to mount it and ride it back to Sasha.

When arriving at Sasha:
:{{text|say|Sasha|Surprise, you scum! You're going to tell me where my sister is or I'll put a bucketful of [[truesilver]] bullets through your wife's heart.}}
:{{text|say|Anatoly|Stop! Do not shoot! Do not hurt Tatjana!}}
:{{text|say|Sasha|Where is [[Anya]]?}}
:{{text|say|Anatoly|The brat's held prisoner in the wolf den on the other side of the mountain. She was to be taken to [[Shade of Arugal|Arugal]]. Are we free to go now?}}
:{{text|say|Sasha|There is one last thing. I need to know where Arugal is.}}
:{{text|say|Anatoly|Forgive me, Tatjana...}}
:''Anatoly kills Tatjana and transforms into a worgen.''
:{{text|say|Anatoly|Nothing you can do can compare to what Arugal can do to us! I will tear you apart myself!}}
:''Sasha kills Anatoly with one shot.''
