==Objectives==
Speak to [[Captain Gryan Stoutmantle]] at the [[Westfall Brigade Encampment]]. 

==Description==
The [[Westfall]] boys were sent east to look for a path into the northern territories. Their secondary objective is to secure strategic resource points, so I'm sure they wouldn't mind investigating a mine.

Look for the Westfall Brigade encampment far to the northeast and seek out Gryan Stoutmantle. You might remember him if you ever spent any time in Westfall. Make sure to tell him I sent you.

He'll be more than happy to let you claim a functioning mine for the king. 

==Completion==
Dumont sent you?  Very well. Let's see what you can do for us. 

==Notes==
The Westfall Brigade encampment is far to the northeast of Amberpine.
