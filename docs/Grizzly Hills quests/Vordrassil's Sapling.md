==Objectives==
[[Hierophant Thayreen]] in [[Amberpine Lodge]] wants you to take the Verdant Torch and use it to burn Vordrassil's Sapling. Bring Vordrassil's Ashes back to Hierophant Thayreen.
* [[Vordrassil's Ashes]]
* [[Verdant Torch]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[druid]]s of old seem to have had good reasons for destroying [[Vordrassil]]. We cannot let the [[furbolg]]s regrow it.

On the other hand, saving [[Ursoc]]'s spirit hinges on the magic contained by the sapling.

Take this torch and use it to burn the tree. You will find it in the middle of [[Grizzlemaw]], inside Vordrassil's old trunk.

Bring me Vordrassil's ashes. It is my hope that once purified by fire, we may use its magic to cleanse Ursoc's spirit of its dark taint. 

==Progress==

Have you brought me the ashes, <name>? 

==Completion==
Yes! Vordrassil's magic is still present in these ashes. There might be hope for Ursoc yet. 

==Notes==
Vordrassil's Sapling is located in the center of the old Vordrassil at {{coords|50.8|42.7|Grizzly Hills}}. Be warned that the interior of the tree is a no-mount zone.
