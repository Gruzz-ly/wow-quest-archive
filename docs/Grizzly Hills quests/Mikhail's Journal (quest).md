==Objectives==
Bring Mikhail's Journal to [[Conqueror Krenna]] in [[Conquest Hold]].
* [[Mikhail's Journal]] (provided)

==Description==
From what you can gather, this journal was written by a denizen of Silverbrook named Mikhail.

It is written in some variant of the common human tongue. Perhaps you should bring this back to Conqueror Krenna.

==Progress==
What's that you've got there?

==Completion==
Hah! Is this some sort of joke?

I barely have any use for books I can actually understand.

==Notes==
The quest [[My Enemy's Friend]] is a breadcrumb to this quest.
