[[Aumana]] at [[Blue Sky Logging Grounds]] wants you to use the Renewing Tourniquet on 10 Wounded Skirmishers.

* [[Renewing Tourniquet]] (provided)

==Description==
You there, <class>! Help me!

We're losing valuable lives! There are simply too many wounded for me to tend to alone. If we can't get our soldiers healed we could be run out of [[Grizzly Hills]] altogether!

Take this tourniquet and use it on the wounded down on the battlefield.

Hurry, <name>! They're dyyying!! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60}}
*20750 (or a {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
Have you healed our wounded yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Oh, thank you, thank you.

You've helped us to live another day. Perhaps there's hope yet.
