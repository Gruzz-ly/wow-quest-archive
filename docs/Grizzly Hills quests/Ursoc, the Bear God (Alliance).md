==Objectives==
[[Hierophant Thayreen]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]] wants you to find [[Tur Ragepaw]] near [[Ursoc's Den]] and defeat Ursoc with his help. Use the [[Purified Ashes of Vordrassil]] on Ursoc's Corpse when you've accomplished this.
* Ursoc Cleansed
* Suggested Players [3]
* [[Purified Ashes of Vordrassil]] (provided)

==Description==
It is time, <name>. Take these ashes and look for the [[furbolg]] that Kodian spoke of. If he went to seek Ursoc, he will be near his den, north of [[Grizzlemaw]].

You will need his help. You won't be able to defeat Ursoc alone.

Once you've defeated Ursoc, use these ashes to purify his spirit. Only then will we know whether our efforts have been in vain or not. 

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| |Kilt of Deific Torment 	
|Pants of Purified Wind
|Greaves of Sanctified Dissolution 	
|Legguards of Dissolved Hope
|Leggings of Forceful Purification}}

You will also receive:
{{itembox| |Bulwark of the Tormented God}}
and {{cost|17|70}}

==Progress==
You've returned. Did you succeed?

==Completion==
<The druid looks pale and her eyes stare blankly past you. She has left a package in anticipation of your return.>

==Notes==
[[Ursoc's Den]] is in the {{coords|52|23|Grizzly Hills}} area. Talk to {{NPC|Neutral|Tur Ragepaw}}. Ragepaw is a druid, and will shift in to bear, moonkin, or tree form when you're ready to begin. He will stay in the selected form for the entire fight.

On victory:
: {{text|say|[[Spirit of Ursoc]]|I thank you all. The druids of old were wise to tear down Vordrassil, for its roots seep deep into the dwelling of an ancient evil.}}
: {{text|say|Spirit of Ursoc|You know their kind as [[old gods]]. Beware [[Yogg-Saron]], the beast with a thousand maws. His evil extends beyond Vordrassil's roots.}}
