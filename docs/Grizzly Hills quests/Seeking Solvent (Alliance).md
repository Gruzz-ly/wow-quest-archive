==Objectives==
[[Barblefink]] at the [[Venture Bay]] Horde base wants you to bring him a canister of Element 115.
* [[Element 115]]

==Description==
Gah! Not again. Another blown gasket....

Every time one of these goes, lubricant gums up all of the gears. Without solvent, it takes hours to clean.

Tell ya what, <race>. There's some fancy rocket fuel on the Venture Company barge in the dock there - element 115 I think they call it. That stuff makes for a great solvent.

Get me one of those and I'll make it worth your trouble.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
You got some of that element 115, <name>?

==Completion==
Ahh yes. That'll save me hours.

Take this for your trouble, friend. And keep an eye out for more element 115. I'll take all you can find.

==Notes==
Accepting this quest will flag you for PvP as long as the quest is in your log.
