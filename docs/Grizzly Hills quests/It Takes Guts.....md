==Objectives==
[[Kraz]] at [[Harkor's Camp]] wants you to enter [[Drakil'jin Ruins]] and collect 5 Drakkari Canopic Jars.
* [[Drakkari Canopic Jar]] (5)

==Description==
Greetings, <class>. It is kind of you to stop and listen to Kraz's tale.

For many years Kraz has strained to hear the spirits and do their bidding.

Recently, many voices have been crying to Kraz from these ruins. They seek for a peace they cannot find on their own.

If you would help the spirits of those who have come before, enter this crypt and collect something that once belonged to those tormented souls. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
What have you found in the crypt for Kraz, <class>?

==Completion==
Entrails? An interesting choice, <race>.

Kraz shall see what is to be learned from them. Thank you for braving the depths of that place.

==Notes==
Opening one of the jars will aggro a spirit nearby.
