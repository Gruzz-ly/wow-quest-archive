== Objectives ==
[[Gan'jo]] wants you to collect the Snow of Eternal Slumber from [[Gan'jo's Chest|his chest]] in the [[Drakil'jin Ruins]].

You are to use the Snow on the Ancient Drakkari Spirits there and take their Drakkari Spirit Particles back to [[Kraz]] at [[Squatter's Camp]].
* [[Snow of Eternal Slumber]]
* [[Drakkari Spirit Particles]] (5)

==Description==
It be as the prophecies said, mon. A <race> <class> be comin' to set our spirits to rest. We been waitin' for a long time now!

The [[Drakkari]] have become a lost people, fierce and savage. Dey forgot many of the things we held sacred and now dey be payin' the price.

But here we suffer by no fault of our own, mon. This place need cleansin' and only the living can do it.

Take the snow from the chest near me and put my bruddas to sleep. Take their remnants to your spirit guide. He be knowin' what to do next. 

==Progress==
Have you completed your task in the crypt, <class>?

==Completion==
You have done well..

Please, sit and listen. There are many things we must discuss.

==Notes==
You can use the chest and collect the Snow of Eternal Slumber while in the spirit world, however you need to be alive to see the spirits (ironically). Speak to Gan'jo and he will offer you the option to come back to life.

When you use the snow, it will freeze the spirit briefly, then it will run back to its crypt and its mummified corpse will burn up, spawning the spirit particle. As each spirit runs to its body, it will say something random:

:{{text|say|Ancient Drakkari Warmonger says: I could sleep forever, mon....}}
:{{text|say|Ancient Drakkari Soothsayer says: Finally, I can be restin'...}}

==Progression==
{{:It Takes Guts....}}
