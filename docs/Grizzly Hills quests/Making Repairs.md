==Objectives==
[[Lurz]] at [[Blue Sky Logging Grounds]] wants you to collect 4 Grooved Cog, 3 Notched Sprocket, and 2 High Tension Spring.
* [[Grooved Cog]] (4)
* [[Notched Sprocket]] (3)
* [[High Tension Spring]] (2)

==Description==
Twenty shredders by noon tomorrow!

Who makes these schedules, anyway? No one who ever put one of these garbage cans back together, that's who....

If I'm going to hit my quota, I'll need a hand. Help me out and I'll share my commission with you - fair enough?

I need cogs, sprockets and springs. They're littered across the ground down by the shredders.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60}}
*20750 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
Ya fetch those parts for me yet?

==Completion==
Thanks, <name>. That should keep me going - at least until tomorrow....

Here's the cash I promised.
