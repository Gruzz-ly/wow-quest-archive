==Objectives==
[[Pipthwack]] in [[Blue Sky Logging Grounds]] wants you to collect 4 Grooved Cogs, 3 Notched Sprockets, and 2 High Tension Springs.
*[[Grooved Cog]] (4)
*[[Notched Sprocket]] (3)
*[[High Tension Spring]] (2)

==Description==
Ack! This thing's a mess!

Goblin engineering leaves a great deal to be desired, believe you me. Just look at this! It's a wonder it ever worked to begin with.

Give me a hand, will ya? To get this even close to operable specifications I'll need to replace a few cogs, sprockets, and springs. You should have no trouble finding them down around the sawmill. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60|}}
*20750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)

==Progress==
Got those parts for me, <class>?

==Completion==
Yes indeed. These should do the trick...

There. One more shredder ready for the fight. Thanks, <[[name]]>.

==Patch changes==
