==Objectives==
Bring 3 Flame-Imbued Talismans to [[Sergeant Nazgrim]] at [[Conquest Hold]].
* [[Flame-Imbued Talisman]] (3)

==Description==
Even as the [[Alliance]] cowards attack our positions, the Dragonflayer [[vrykul]] outpost of [[Voldrune]], to the southeast, prepares for war. The vrykul are far from the strongest enemy we face here, but we must eliminate them before they can truly threaten us.

Their most powerful warriors are permitted to ride half-trained proto-drakes into battle. To control the beasts, their flamebinders create powerful talismans. You'll need to slay them and take the talismans if our plan is to work.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
Did you collect those talismans?

==Completion==
With the power of the talismans, the drake has no choice but to obey your commands. The thane's fate is sealed.
