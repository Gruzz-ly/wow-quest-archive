==Objectives==
[[Master Woodsman Anderhol|Anderhol]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]] wants you to bring him 5 [[Blackroot Stalk]]s.

==Description==
We must act quickly, <race>! We can't risk letting those precious seeds become fully digested. They need to come out, NOW.

Forage up some blackroot from the riverbank just west of here and I'll make you a purgative that should get you doing your duty.

Hurry now! And remember, you brought this upon yourself.... 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|30}}

==Progress==
Have you found the blackroot? 

==Completion==
These should do just fine...

<Anderhol deftly twists the stalks, collecting their slick fluids in a tiny vial.>

There we go, now it's time to get down to business.
