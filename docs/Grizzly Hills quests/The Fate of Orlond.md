==Objectives==
Locate [[Surveyor Orlond]] within [[Thor Modan]].

==Description==
When we began excavating the city, I sent Surveyor Orlond to check the stability of the tunnels in Thor Modan. I didn't see him escape when we withdrew at the beginning of the battle, and I worry he may still be trapped inside the city.

If we're going to get an army through Thor Modan, we'll need the information he was collecting. [[Gryan Stoutmantle|Stoutmantle]] and his superiors would have my hide if the tunnels collapsed on one of their brigades!

==Completion==
A quick examination of the body reveals that the surveyor has been dead for some time. Looking through his pack, you stumble upon Orlond's handwritten notes.

==Notes==
He is located at {{coords|67.49|15.28|Grizzly Hills}}.  With the ability to fly in Northrend, he can be reached by flying through the open ceiling of Thor Modan, to avoid wading through all the mobs.

[[Into the Breach (Grizzly Hills)]] also takes one into Thor Modan, and so combines well with this quest.
