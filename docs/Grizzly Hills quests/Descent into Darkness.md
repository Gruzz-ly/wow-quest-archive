This quest makes available the quests [[The Failed World Tree]] and [[A Dark Influence]], leading to [[Ursoc, the Bear God (Alliance)|Ursoc, the Bear God]].

==Objectives==
Bring Mikhail's Journal to [[Lieutenant Dumont]] in [[Amberpine Lodge]].
* [[Mikhail's Journal]] (provided)

==Description==
The journal was written by a denizen of [[Silverbrook]] named Mikhail. It details the arrival of a shadow-worshipping group called the "wolfcult."

The villagers were reluctant to embrace the cult at first, but sympathizers sprung up gradually among town residents.

Unsettled by this, Mikhail sent his daughter [[Sasha]] away from Silverbrook while he attempted to reason with the other villagers.

Mikhail's last entry mentions a meeting of local town leaders to discuss unspecified events in [[Hollowstone Mine]]. 

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| 
|Abandoned Hood
|Discarded Miner's Jerkin
|Patched Trapper Pauldrons
|Rusty Cave Stompers}}

==Progress==
What's that you've got there? 

==Completion==
I imagined there would be more to this than just an isolated town of hostiles.

We have men near Hollowstone Mine, perhaps it would be in our interest to do a little research. 

==Notes==
The journal that starts this quest is dropped by [[Silverbrook Hunter]]s and [[Vladek]].  You are most likely to be hunting these mobs during the course of {{alliance}} [[A Swift Response]] or {{horde}}[[My Enemy's Friend]].

==Progression==
