==Objectives==
Look for clues inside [[Hollowstone Mine]] northwest of the [[Westfall Brigade Encampment]]. 

==Description==
I've been meaning to send some of our lads to check out [[Hollowstone Mine]]. Haven't had a chance to yet—we've had our hands full between the [[Horde]] on the west and the [[Iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] to the east.

If [[Lieutenant Dumont|Dumont]] sent you, though, the least I can do is point you in the right direction.

You'll find the mine entrance to the northwest, not far from here. See if you think operations there can be salvaged. We sure could use the additional resources until our mine in [[Farshire]] is operational again.

==Completion==
You've come to help me, haven't you! 

==Notes==
[[Petrov]] is just inside the mine, which is marked on the zone map just to the northwest of the encampment.
