==Objectives==
Use the Smoke Bomb to drive 20 [[Venture Co. Straggler|Venture Company Stragglers]] from their buildings and then report to [[Stone Guard Ragetotem]].
* [[Venture Co. Straggler|Venture Company Stragglers]] smoked out (20)
* [[Smoke Bomb (quest item)]] (provided)

==Description==
Not only is this port infested with sniveling [[Alliance]] cowards, but to make matters worse, there are still [[Venture Company]] employees holed up in some of the buildings. They're not worth the time it takes to kill and I can't spare the warriors anyway.

Maybe we can "convince" them to make for their ship. Take this smoke bomb and use it to smoke out the stragglers from their places in the bunkhouse, sawmill, or stables. Don't get too close, though; there's no telling what diseases they're carrying.

==Rewards==
*You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60|h-hp=50}}
*20750 (or a {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)

==Progress==
Have you smoked out the last of the Venture Company vermin yet?

==Completion==
The general will be pleased that you've dealt with the Venture Company problem. Now, the men can focus on beating back the Alliance.

==Patch changes==
