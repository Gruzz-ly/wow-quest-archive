==Objectives==
Using the abilities of your [[War Golem]], defeat [[Iron Thane Furyhammer]], then return to [[Tormak the Scarred]] at [[Camp Oneqwah]].
* [[Iron Thane Furyhammer]] slain
* [[Golem Control Unit (charged)]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that the golem is fully charged, it can be used against the leader at Dun Argol.

When I observed Iron Thane Furyhammer, he was always guarded by a personal golem that shielded him from all harm.

That construct called The Anvil, can be disrupted, causing him to drop the shield. Use your golem's EMP ability to do just that. You'll be able to activate and take control of your golem inside Dun Argol.

The thane is in the main plant at the top and supervises production from the bottom level. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Grounded Gloves
|Crackpot Spaulders
|Short-Circuiting Boots
|Golem-Rider's Greaves}}
You will also receive: {{cost|11|80}}

==Completion==
So the prospector made good on his promises? Good. I was beginning to wonder if all of this scrounging for bits of metal and stealing building materials would amount to anything.

It's a shame he's of no further use to us.

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Tormak the Scarred|I'll admit, dwarf, I was pleasantly surprised to see your plan succeed.}}
:{{Text|say|Tormak the Scarred|We can't just let you return to your companions and we can't take you with us...}}
:''Tormak draws his axe.''
:{{Text|say|Prospector Rokar|Wait a minute here! You promised to spare me if I helped you. I held up my end o' the bargain!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Scout Vor'takh]]|Stay your blade, Chieftain. He may yet have value to us.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Vor'takh|[[The Damaged Journal (Horde)|Remember the dwarven journal that was discovered?]] Well, this dwarf could be exactly what we need to track down [[Brann Bronzebeard]] and capture him.}}
:{{Text|say|Prospector Rokar|By the Light, Brann's alive? I'd never help you capture him!}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Vor'takh|You will if you wish to keep your head attached to your shoulders.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Vor'takh|Does that satisfy you, Tormak?}}
:{{Text|say|Tormak the Scarred|He will live so long as he proves useful. I'd be careful if I was you, dwarf..}}
