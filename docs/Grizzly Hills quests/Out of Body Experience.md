==Objectives==
Drink the Gossamer Potion near [[Ruuna's Crystal Ball]] and witness the Vision from the Past.
* Vision from the Past
* [[Gossamer Potion]] (provided)

==Description==
Ah, you seek a vision of the past. You're a wise <race>.

Every time someone drops by for a reading, they seem to always ask about the future. When you get to be my age, you learn that scrying the past, more often than not, is more useful.

Drink this potion and peer into my crystal ball. Let us see what knowledge we can obtain.

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
Did you learn anything from your vision? You mentioned [[Solstice Village]] during your trance—which marks the second time someone has spoken the place's name today.

==Notes==
Drinking the potion gives the player a vision of the past, where the [[San'layn]] [[Prince Theraldis]] oversees the resurrection of [[Archmage Arugal]] by [[Prince Keleseth]], [[Prince Atherann]] and [[Prince Valanar]].
:{{text|say|Prince Valanar|Rise, Arugal! The power of the Lich King commands you!}}
:{{text|say|Prince Theraldis|Yes... he shall suit our needs perfectly. Have him sent to [[Solstice Village]] when you're ready. Arthas will not be pleased if we fall behind schedule.}}
