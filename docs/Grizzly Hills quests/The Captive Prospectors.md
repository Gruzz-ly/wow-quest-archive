==Objectives==
Free Prospector Gann, Prospector Torgan, and Prospector Varana, then return to [[Mountaineer Kilian]] at [[Prospector's Point]].
* [[Prospector Gann]] Rescued
* [[Prospector Torgan]] Rescued
* [[Prospector Varana]] Rescued

==Description==
[[Raegar Breakbrow|Raegar]] sent a team of prospectors into [[Dun Argol]] to search for artifacts and information about the history of the settlement. Raegar's team never expected Dun Argol to be this heavily populated.

They're being held captive while the [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] prepare for war. We haven't the men to charge in after them, and Raegar's too busy fantasizing about defeating the irons to be of much help.

It falls to you, <name>. Any of the irons or their servants could be carrying the keys to the cages holding our men.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Did you locate the missing prospectors?

==Completion==
<Mountaineer Kilian listens as you relate what the captive prospectors told you.>

They mentioned [[Loken|Kronus]] and a war against stone giants? You're certain?

So Raegar's instincts were right. We have to find a way to get in there and learn more about their plans.

==Notes==
Both Prospectors Torgan and Varana are in cages outside the various buildings of Dun Argol.  Prospector Gann is inside one of the buildings.

*{{Text|say|Prospector Torgan{{coords|76.3|58.5|Grizzly Hills}} says: Thank goodness! I was worried they were going to press me into service in their war against the stone giants!}}
*{{Text|say|Prospector Varana{{coords|76.0|61.1|Grizzly Hills}} says: Those irons are crazy! They keep talking about serving their 'master Loken' but from what I can tell, only a few receive orders from him.}}

That the quest completion text refers to ''Kronus'' is probably a continuity error.  It appears that Prospector Varana originally mentioned Kronus, but was later patched.
