==Objectives==
[[Katja]] in [[Silverbrook]] wants you to uproot 8 [[Wolfsbane Root]]s.
*[[Wolfsbane Root (object)|Wolfsbane Root]] (8)

==Description==
Have you heard of the wolfsbane plant? It is a horrible weed... it destroys our farmable crops.

We spent all of last week cutting them down, but the roots are beginning to sprout again.

It might not seem like an urgent matter, but a resurgence of the plant could be a real... disaster. Do you think you could help us by uprooting them where you find them near the village? 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Herbalist's Pauldrons|Girdle of Growing Vines|Pruning Pendant|Drape of Horticultural Sanitization}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|4|40}}
*20750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|96}} (total) at 80)

==Progress==
Yes, <class>?

==Completion==
<Katja reels away from you nervously.>

Thank you, <name>.  You didn't get any wolfsbane on you, did you?  I've got these... allergies that act up once in a while.
