==Objectives==
[[Kraz]] at [[Harkor's Camp]] wants you to use the Drakil'jin Mallet on the gongs outside [[Drakil'jin Ruins]]. Once you have been slain, you are to enter the ruins and speak with the spirit of [[Gan'jo]] while you are dead.
* Death by [[Warlord Jin'arrak]]
* [[Charged Drakil'jin Mallet]] (provided)

==Description==
These Drakkari have met you with nothing but savage hostility. You owe them nothing. Few indeed would carry out the task that Kraz asks of you today.

To cleanse this place and send the spirits to their eternal rest, you must join them in death.

There is one inside the crypt who awaits you - on the other side. He holds the knowledge we seek, <name>.

Use the mallet on the gongs. The spirit of he who corrupts this place will surely deliver you to the spirit world.

Kraz awaits your return. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Completion==
Your coming has been foretold, friend. It was good of you to come.

==Notes==
You're going to "die", but not take durability damage. Ring the gongs, and the warlord will kill you. Die and move on... into the catacombs (the underground part of the ruins). [[Gan'jo]] is not hard to spot, so long as the warlord's special move is what "killed" you.
