==Objectives==
[[General Gorlok]] at the lighthouse in [[Venture Bay]] wants you to destroy the [[Alliance]] Lumber Boat.

General Gorlok will only be present at the lighthouse when the [[Horde]] has it in their possession.
*Destroyed Alliance Lumber Shipment

==Description==
You there, <race>! Get your lousy carcass over here!

The Alliance have a shipment of lumber all ready for transport just northeast of here. Since getting our hands on that wood is out of the question, there's only one thing to do - destroy it!

The goblin at the end of the dock here has some [[Rocket Propelled Warhead|torpedoes]] all ready to go. He's got all the fuel for them on the docked goblin ship.

Get some [[Element 115|fuel]], then commandeer one of the torpedoes and ride it into their ship.

Dismissed!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60|h-hp=3}}
*20750 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)

==Progress==
Has that Alliance lumber been burned yet, <class>?

==Completion==
Ha hah! What a ride, eh <class>?

If we can't control the resources here, then no one can!

When will those puny Alliance pests realize that they are no match for the might of the Horde?
