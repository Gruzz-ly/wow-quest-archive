== Objectives ==
Report to [[Lieutenant Dumont]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]] in western [[Grizzly Hills]].

== Description ==
While we focus to hold our ground at [[Wintergarde]] and deal with the unfolding events of the [[Angrathar the Wrathgate|Wrathgate]], battalions from as far away as [[Westfall]] battle their way through the dense foliage and inhospitable denizens of Grizzly Hills. All in hopes of finding an alternate route into [[Icecrown]].

Lieutenant Dumont, stationed at Amberpine Lodge, has enlisted the aid of able bodied citizens willing to risk life and limb in the uncharted wilds. Will you rise to meet this challenge?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 3,050 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valiance Expedition]]

== Completion ==
You were almost shot down, eh? Savage monsters - those [[Horde]].

Payback will come for what they've done. You can count on at least that much, <class>.

Now, it's time to put you to work. 

== Notes ==
Accepting this quest will immediately put you on a [[Wintergarde Gryphon]] controlled by a [[Wintergarde Gryphon Rider]], who sets off east to Grizzly Hills.
:{{Text|say|Wintergarde Gryphon Rider|I'll have you at Amberpine Lodge in no time, ally! We just have to make one brief stop first...}}
:{{Text|say|Wintergarde Gryphon Rider|We're gonna do a quick fly by [[Conquest Hold]] to see what those filthy, no good, [[Horde]] are up to. Keep your eyes peeled for their [[wind rider]]s. Not that they'd ever catch me!}}

Above Conquest Hold:
:{{Text|say|Wintergarde Gryphon Rider|What in the name of [[Bronzebeard]] is goin' on here? Look at this place! I think...}}
:''Three [[Conquest Hold Windrager]]s spawn and begin pursuing the gryphon!''
:{{Text|yell|Conquest Hold Windrager|[Orcish] RAGATH'A NO'BU KIL KIL}}
:{{Text|say|Wintergarde Gryphon Rider|Uh-oh. We've got company! HOLD ON TIGHT! I'm gonna try and lose 'em!}}

The gryphon quickly flies northeast to Amberpine Lodge, and the windragers soon despawn. Upon reaching the lodge, the player is dropped off from the gryphon and parachutes to the ground while the gryphon rider flies off and disappears.
:{{Text|say|Wintergarde Gryphon Rider|I think we lost 'em! That was a close one! Welp, as promised, Amberpine Lodge in one piece. Keep your feet on the ground, friend!}}

Head into the lodge and talk to Lieutenant Dumont to turn in.
