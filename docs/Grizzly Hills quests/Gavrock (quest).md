==Objectives==
Speak with [[Gavrock]] at the [[Ruins of Tethys]].

==Description==
Without your help, we wouldn't have been able to turn the tide of the battle for [[Thor Modan]]. This ancient city has long been a battlefield between the forces of earth and stone. I can only hope we have silenced it for the last time.

The [[Iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] can still use their magic to capture and enslave my brothers. Gavrock is searching for a way to free the runed giants. Look for him on a small cluster of islands, called the Ruins of Tethys, off the central part of the [[Eastwind Shore]] to the south.

==Completion==
I know Kurun is glad for your help. The defeat of Thor Modan will be a great achievement for us, but it will not free our brothers.

==Progression==
