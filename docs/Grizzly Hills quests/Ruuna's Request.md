==Objectives==
[[Ruuna the Blind]]{{coords|44.0|47.9|Grizzly Hills}} wants you to obtain 4 handfuls of Gossamer Dust.
* [[Gossamer Dust]] (4)

==Description==
I will not charge you gold for my services, for I can foresee that your actions are necessary and much hinges on what you learn today.

I will, however, ask you to collect a reagent for me. Obtain gossamer dust from the fern feeder moths northeast of here. Do this and I will prepare a potion that will take you to the time and place where the events took place that you need to witness. 

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| |Foreseer's Girdle
|Pauldrons of the Prophet
|Gossamer-Stained Grips
|Thought-Purifying Protector}}

==Progress==
Did you obtain the dust, <name>?

==Completion==
Good. These will do just fine.

I will have the potion ready for you in no time at all.

==Notes==
The [[Fern Feeder Moth]]s that drop the quest items can be found around {{coords|50|30|Grizzly Hills}}.
