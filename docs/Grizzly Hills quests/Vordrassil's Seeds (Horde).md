==Objectives==
[[Windseer Grayhorn]] in [[Conquest Hold]] wants you to go to [[Grizzlemaw]] and obtain 8 of [[Vordrassil's Seed]]s.
* [[Vordrassil's Seed]] (8)

==Description==
We must make sure that Vordrassil is never regrown. The [[furbolg]] must have harvested its seed.

Go to Grizzlemaw, in central [[Grizzly Hills]], and obtain all the seeds that you can find. I will make sure they're properly destroyed. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Hoarder's Necklace
|Band of the Tender
|Drape of the Possessive Soul}}

==Progress==
Have you obtained Vordrassil's seeds yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I'll take those from you.

The corruptive power of these seeds is dangerous. I must destroy them right away.

==Notes==
Kill either a Redfang or a Frostpaw furbolg to make yourself neutral to the opposite faction, which makes it easier to pick up the seeds.
