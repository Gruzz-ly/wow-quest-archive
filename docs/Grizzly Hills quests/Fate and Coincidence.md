==Objectives==
Speak to [[Sasha]] at the [[White Pine Trading Post]].

==Description==
There are two types of people in this world, <name>. Those who believe in coincidence and those who don't.

On the day I lost my eyesight I was given the gift of clairvoyance. I suppose you can guess what sort of person I am.

Earlier today, a young woman named [[Sasha]] was granted the same vision you were. You will want to talk to her.

You'll find her directly east of here at the [[White Pine Trading Post]], on the way to [[Solstice Village]].

==Completion==
I was wondering when you'd turn up. Think you can give me a hand here?

==Notes==
Sasha can be found at {{coords|57.5|41.3|Grizzly Hills}}.
