==Objectives==
Defeat 10 [[Horde]] units or [[player]]s in [[Venture Bay]] and return to [[Lieutenant Stuart]].
* [[Horde]] killed in [[Venture Bay]] (10)

==Description==
We cannot permit the Horde to control Venture Bay. The port is essential to our operations in Grizzly Hills and beyond.

[[Captain Gryan Stoutmantle|Captain Stoutmantle]] has taken the rest of the [[Westfall Brigade]] east in search of a passage through the mountains, so we'll have no reinforcements.

Go into the field, <name>, and kill the [[Conquest Hold Berserker|Conquest Hold berserkers]] the Horde has sent against us. Cut them down until none remain standing. The [[Alliance]] must have this port!

==Rewards==
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you to report?

==Completion==
Your bravery has inspired the men of the Westfall Brigade. Even now they fight with greater ferocity. The port will soon be ours.
