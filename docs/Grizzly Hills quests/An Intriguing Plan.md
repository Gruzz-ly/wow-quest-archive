==Objectives==
Bring the completed [[War Golem Blueprint]]s to [[Prospector Rokar]] at [[Camp Oneqwah]].
*[[War Golem Blueprint]]

==Description==
Prospector Rokar has decided to help us. He's concocted a plan to use the iron dwarves' strength against them.

I must admit, our new 'friend' is more insightful than I'd given him credit for. He's correct in that our numbers are too few for a direct attack.

Travel to Dun Argol, in the snowy regions to the southeast, and capture all the parts of their war golem blueprints from the iron rune-smiths there. Bring the assembled blueprint to Rokar and we'll see if his plan has any merit.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|90|}}
*20950 [[XP]] (or {{cost|12|57|}} compensation at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
Do... do you have those blueprints I asked for?

==Completion==
So Tormak's going to go ahead with the plan? I suppose he wouldn't have sent you if he didn't.

Oh, bother... Now how am I going to figure out how to put this together under all this pressure?
