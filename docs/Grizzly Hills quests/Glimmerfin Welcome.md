==Objectives==
Collect 10 Meaty Crab Chunks and deliver them to [[Glimmergut]] in [[Venture Bay]].
* [[Meaty Crab Chunk]] (10)

==Description==
First thing's{{sic}} first, they're probably hungry. Life up here in the cold isn't quite as easy as it is elsewhere, and even the most acclimated [[murloc]]s sometimes have trouble finding food.

We're going to need to feed them, but also help them find food for themselves.

They're already watching you, so search the area around where you found the murlocs for food sources and show them what to hunt. Then bring the meat to their leader--just look for the biggest one.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Mrgg?

==Completion==
Mrg?

<Glimmergut looks at you, then cautiously takes the crab chunks and hands them to a nearby [[Glimmerfin Forager|forager]]. The forager and Glimmergut appear to have a short conversation about your crab hunt.

Glimmergut turns back to you and points down at the sand.>

==Notes==
Straight back to [[Venture Bay]] in [[Grizzly Hills]]...

The crabs for this quest ([[Scuttleclaw Crab]], [[Scuttleclaw Sandshell]], and [[Scuttleclaw Skimmer]]), and the turn-in NPC (inside the sunken ship)  are both underwater, so the [[Elixir of Water Breathing]] rewarded from the last quest will come in useful...
