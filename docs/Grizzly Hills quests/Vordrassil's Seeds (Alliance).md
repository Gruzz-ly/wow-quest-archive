==Objectives==
[[Hierophant Thayreen]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]] wants you to go to [[Grizzlemaw]] and obtain 8 of Vordrassil's Seeds.
* [[Vordrassil's Seed]] (8)

==Description==
We cannot allow [[Vordrassil]] to grow again. If the [[furbolg]] regrew it once, they can do it again.

Go to [[Grizzlemaw]], in central [[Grizzly Hills]], and obtain Vordrassil's seeds. I will make sure they're properly disposed of. 

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox|
|Hoarder's Necklace
|Band of the Tender
|Drape of the Possessive Soul}}

==Progress==
Do you have the seeds, <name>?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. I'll take those from you.

The corruptive power of these seeds is dangerous. I must destroy them right away.

==Notes==
The seeds can be found all over the ground around Vordrassil.
