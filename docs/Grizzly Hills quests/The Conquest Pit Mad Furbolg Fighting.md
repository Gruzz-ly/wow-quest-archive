==Description==
You're not bad. Not bad at all.

Think you can take a furbolg? What about one of those extra-large crazed Northrend furbolgs?

Good, good. Get your crew together, and head to the ring. Let's give these folks a show... maybe we can earn some more coin while we're at it.

Those were some sharp moves, friend!  Lots of bets against you, which is good news cash-wise!
