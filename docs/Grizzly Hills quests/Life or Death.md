==Objectives==
[[Rheanna]] at [[Blue Sky Logging Grounds]] wants you to use the Renewing Bandage on 10 [[Wounded Westfall Infantry]] units.
*Westfall Infantry Healed (10)
*[[Renewing Bandage]] (provided)

==Description==
Oh, the carnage....

I've been through many battles, <class>, and this one was more brutal than any I've seen. Our fight with the Horde has become more intense than ever. It's them or us here in [[Northrend]] - life or death.

If we are to survive here another day we'll need to mend our wounded. There are too many for me to rescue alone.

I've prepared special bandages that will enable you to assist me. Take one and tend to those who have not yet succumbed to their wounds.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60|}}
*20750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)
*+125 [[reputation]] with [[Alliance Vanguard]]
*+250 reputation with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to save the dying, <name>?

==Completion==
Wonderful!

The [[Alliance]] shall live to see another day, in part due to your diligence.

Please accept my thanks, friend.
