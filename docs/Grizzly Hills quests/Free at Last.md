==Objectives==
Use Gavrock's Runebreaker to free 4 [[Runed Giant]]s, then return to [[Gavrock]] at the [[Ruins of Tethys]].
* [[Runed Giant]]s Freed (4)
* [[Gavrock's Runebreaker]] (provided)

==Description==
The rock shard you imbued should be powerful enough to break the runic magic binding my brothers.

Take it with you and find the runed giants walking north along the [[Eastwind Shore]]. Unleash the power stored in the stone and observe the results.

If it works, the runed giants should return to their senses and stop obeying the iron dwarves. If the stone fails to work, the giants may attack in a weakened state. But, what choice do we have? If we do not try, they will remain enslaved without hope. 

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox|
|Liberator's Blade
|Branch of the Roaming Spirit
|Spire of Soaring Rumination
|Bondsniper
|Talon of Freedom}}
You will also receive: {{cost|11|80}}

==Progress==
Were you able to free any of my brothers?

==Completion==
So it's an uncertain thing? I wish it was not a matter of chance, but at least we're on the right path. Without your help, this wouldn't have ever been possible. Should you learn any more about the machinations of the iron dwarves and their plans toward the children of stone, seek us out and we will hear you, <name>.

==Notes==
The runebreaker has a chance of working, much less than 30%.  When it fails, the Runed Giant will attack (but with much reduced damage).  The runebreaker has a cooldown of 10 seconds.  If the mob is still alive when it recycles, you can try again on the same mob.  Strategies of kiting, immobilizing, stunning, and "simply let the mob beat on you" are all adequate to keeping the giant alive (even for clothies) while the runebreaker resets.

When freed the giants thank you (several variations):
*{{text|say|Freed Giant|I thought I was doomed.  Thank you for freeing me.}}
*{{text|say|Freed Giant|You have my gratitude.}}
*{{text|say|Freed Giant|I never thought I'd be free from that terrible spell!}}
*{{text|say|Freed Giant|Thank you, small one.}}
*{{text|say|Freed Giant|Children of iron, lend me your blades!}}
*{{text|say|Freed Giant|Crush the small one!}}
*{{text|say|Freed Giant|Iron masters, aid me in this battle!}}
*{{text|say|Freed Giant|The enemy grows stronger! Aid me!}}
*{{text|say|Freed Giant|We will destroy you, puny creature!}}
