==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ruuna the Blind]] at [[Ruuna's Camp]] near [[Vordrassil Pass]].

==Description==
This trapper business has the potential to be more important than we've accounted for.

If they're not with the [[Alliance]], there's a good chance they're with the [[Scourge]], which could mean trouble.

Our previous efforts might've paid off, though. We spotted our former captive meeting with a fortune teller of some sort before we lost track of her.

I'm almost certain now that she will take us to their leader if we can find her again. Find [[Ruuna the Blind]] and see what you can find out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5250 [[XP]] (or a{{Cost|3|15}} at level 80)

==Completion==
You seek knowledge beyond your reach so you've come to me. I must warn you, stranger, the answers I provide might not be to your liking.

==Notes==
Ruuna is in her camp at {{coords|44|48|Grizzly Hills}}.

==Progression==
