==Objectives==
Report to [[Lieutenant Dumont]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]] in western [[Grizzly Hills]].

==Description==
While we focus to hold our ground at [[Wintergarde]] and deal with the unfolding events of the [[Wrathgate]], battalions from as far away as [[Westfall]] battle their way through the dense foliage and inhospitable denizens of [[Grizzly Hills]]. All in hopes of finding an alternate route into [[Icecrown]].

Lieutenant Dumont, stationed at Amberpine Lodge, has enlisted the aid of able bodied citizens willing to risk life and limb in the uncharted wilds. Will you rise to meet this challenge?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||74|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Completion==
Savage monsters - those [[Horde]].

Payback will come for what they've done. You can count on at least that much, <class>.

Now, it's time to put you to work.

==Progression==
