==Objectives==
Slay [[Captain Brightwater]] and report to [[General Khazgar]] at [[Venture Bay]].
* [[Captain Brightwater]] slain
* Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
With every advance, our men are met by fresh [[Alliance]] reinforcements. It's almost as though their commander anticipates my every move!

The time has come for good Captain Brightwater to meet his end. He commands his troops from aboard an Alliance [[destroyer]] at the far end of the bay.

This will be no easy fight, <name>. Take along a couple of trusted friends, or if you have a key to one of those repaired [[shredder]]s, use it to disembowel Brightwater! Either way, he must fall!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60}}
*20750 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)

==Progress==
Have you eliminated the enemy captain?

==Completion==
You are a true soldier of the [[Horde]], <name>. Your bravery will inspire my men to victory!

==Patch changes==
