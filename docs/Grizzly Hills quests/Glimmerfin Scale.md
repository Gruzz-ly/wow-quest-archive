'''Glimmerfin Scale''' begins a short quest chain that rewards the [[Glimr's Cracked Egg]] battle pet. Before starting, players are encouraged to have access to increased swim speed, either via a potion, the [[Underlight Angler]], or an [[aquatic mounts|aquatic mount]], as two quests involve objectives in [[fatigue]] waters.

To start, head to {{co|18.5|88.3|Grizzly Hills}} on a small iceberg east of [[Venture Bay]] in [[Grizzly Hills]]. A [[Glimmerfin Scout]] spawns every 5 minutes or so. Scare it off and it'll sometimes leave a [[Glimmerfin Scale (object)|Glimmerfin Scale]] on the ground, which starts this quest.

==Objectives==
Show the scale to [[King Mrgl-Mrgl]] in [[Borean Tundra]].

==Description==
<A brightly-colored scale fell to the ground as [[Glimmerfin Scout|the murloc]] ran off. It was unlike any other [[murloc]] you've seen in [[Northrend]].

Perhaps King Mrgl-Mrgl would know more about this new species?>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*3x [[Elixir of Water Breathing]]
* {{cost|||25}}
* 150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What do you have there? Oh! Isn't this colorful.

You say there's a new brand of murlocs down south? That doesn't surprise me, strange things have been happening in the waters far from here, from what I've heard.

Well, if they're friendly, it's up to us to welcome them! Here's a few potions, you're probably going to need them.

==Notes==
The [[Glimmerfin Scale (object)|Glimmerfin Scale]] spawns when the [[Glimmerfin Scout]] runs away from players when it spawns at {{co|18.4|88.2|Grizzly Hills}} on a small iceberg just offshore from [[Venture Bay]] in [[Grizzly Hills]]. After picking it up, head clear across the continent to the northwestern corner of the [[Borean Tundra]] mainland, where [[King Mrgl-Mrgl]] is still observing at the [[Winterfin Retreat]].
