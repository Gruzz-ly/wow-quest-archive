==Objectives==
[[Master Woodsman Anderhol]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]] wants you to kill [[Tallhorn Stag]] and collect 8 Succulent Venison.
* [[Succulent Venison]] (8)

==Description==
G'day, <class>.

The good lieutenant here says that there's been a Horde raid on our storehouse that's left our food supply dangerously low.

No doubt we'll make those cretins pay, but first we need to focus our attention on restocking. My men are doing all they can, but we're going to need every able body to contribute if we're to avert a crisis.

You should have no trouble harvesting venison from the local stag in these parts. Happy hunting!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
How goes the hunt, <race>?

==Completion==
These are some choice pieces of meat!
