==Objectives==
Use Kilian's Camera to record the images of 8 [[Iron dwarf|Iron Dwarves]] in [[Dun Argol]], then return to [[Mountaineer Kilian]] at [[Prospector's Point]].
* Iron Dwarf Images Captured (8)
* [[Kilian's Camera]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that we've got the uniform, we've got to get enough information to complete your camouflage.

[[Raegar Breakbrow|Raegar]] brought along this camera to document the team's finds, but I have a different use in mind. I want you to take it with you to Dun Argol and use it to capture the images of iron dwarves.

Of course, your models aren't going to be a cooperative lot, so you may have to, err... subdue them first. Bring back the camera and the images when you're done. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Did you get those snapshots?

==Completion==
Good, these should do. Now to create a kit to pass you off as a convincing iron dwarf.

==Notes==
By subdue he means kill, obviously.
