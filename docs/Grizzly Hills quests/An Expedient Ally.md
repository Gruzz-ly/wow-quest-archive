==Objectives==
Speak with [[Kurun]] on the hill overlooking [[Thor Modan]].

==Description==
The old iron dwarf capital of Thor Modan, far to the northeast, is under siege by a mysterious band of stone giants and earthen.

Why the creations or the titans would war against each other is beyond my understanding and the Horde's interest, but there is an opportunity here to weaken a mutual enemy.

Travel to Thor Modan and seek out this '[[Kurun]]' who commands the giants and earthen.  Make common cause with him and use his forces to crush the iron dwarves.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2100 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|1|26|}}compensation at level 80)

==Completion==
<You introduce yourself to Kurun.>

So the sons of iron are your enemies as well?

My forces have the iron dwarves pinned inside their city, but we could use help in pressing the attack. Will you aid us?

==Notes==
[[Kurun]] is located at {{coords|65.8|17.8|Grizzly Hills}} in Grizzly Hills.  He is on the hill behind [[Thor Modan]], in the [[Boulder Hills]] subzone.  Take the road that is north of [[Thor Modan]] to get there.

==Progression==
{{:Find Kurun!}}
