==Objectives==
[[Master Woodsman Anderhol|Anderhol]] in [[Amberpine Lodge]] wants you to kill 5 Imperial Eagles and then report back to him.
* [[Imperial Eagle]] slain (5)

==Description==
Well, <name>, we've determined how the [[Horde]] was able to locate our hidden stores of food.

It turns out that they were binding their sight to the unsuspecting eagles that soar above the trees here. Using eagle vision, they were able to effectively spy on our every action.

By order of the lieutenant, we've got to hunt down these majestic birds in order to thwart our enemy.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
Have you completed your task, <class>?

==Completion==
A somber task, I know. But we can rest easier now knowing the enemy's eyes are no longer upon us. 

==Progression==
