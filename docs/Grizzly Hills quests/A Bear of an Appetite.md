==Objectives==
Bring 6 Northern Salmon to [[Hugh Glass]] at the [[Redwood Trading Post]].
* [[Northern Salmon]] (6)
* [[Fishing Net]] (provided)

==Description==
Thank goodness you're back, Limpy! I worried that [[Griselda (bear)|Griselda]] and I were going to be all alone.

I'm cooking up some food here for us, but Griselda'll have none of it.

She's fond of the fish that live off the coast of the [[Eastwind Shore]], to the east. Can't stand them myself, but she's always been a picky eater. Six good-sized fish ought to keep her happy for a while.

Now, run... err... limp along, Joe. Wouldn't want to keep the girl waiting, would ya?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
If you don't hurry, it'll be more than just her stomach growling...

==Completion==
You! You're not Limpy Joe!

==Notes==
[[School of Northern Salmon|Schools of Northern Salmon]] can be found in the waters just off the shore of Grizzly Hills to the east.

These schools are not like regular fish schools. They do not show up with the [[Find Fish]] ability, and you will not catch any [[Northern Salmon]] with a fishing rod. To get the fish for this quest, you must use the [[Fishing Net]] provided.
