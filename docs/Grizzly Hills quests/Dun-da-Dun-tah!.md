==Description==
Listen, kid. This is no place for you to be playin' around.

I'm about to make a break for it. Stick with me and I'll get you outta here. 

==Rewards==

==Completion==
So, yah survived a little adventure with our good friend, did yah?

That should be reward enough in itself, but here - I'm feelin' generous. 

==Notes==
The quest title refers to the first four notes of the ''Indiana Jones'' theme.  The quest giver's name (Harrison Jones) is an amalgamation of 'Harrison Ford' (the actor) and 'Indiana Jones' (the character).

This quest starts an escort back out of the crypt, through the courtyard and off to the east.

After Harrison rings the gong, he walks towards the exit, and flames appear.  Moments later, so does [[Tecahuna]], a humongous cobra.  Harrison is handily able to tank this creature (perhaps better than you can).  Adds spawn in pairs, based on Tecahuna's health (and don't disappear when it is killed).

Note that if you ran out of the room before the flames appeared at the entrance, you may not be able to get back in to help Harrison with the fight.  He will die, and you will have to start over.  It may take a while for him to respawn.
