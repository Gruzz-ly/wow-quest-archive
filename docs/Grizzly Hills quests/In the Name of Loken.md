Speak with [[Hugh Glass]] and [[Gavrock]] about [[Loken]], then report your findings to [[Scout Vor'takh]] at [[Camp Oneqwah]].
* Hugh Glass Questioned
* Gavrock Questioned

==Description==
The [[Iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] stand as one of the fiercest and most coordinated foes in [[Northrend]]. Wherever we have traveled, they have battled us with the name of Loken on their lips.

We must learn who this Loken is and what he seeks. The locals may be of help.

To the northeast, at the [[Redwood Trading Post]], a human named Hugh Glass peddles his wares. Further east, at the [[Ruins of Tethys]], you'll find a stone giant named Gavrock. Ask them about this Loken. They've got to know something of use.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|60}}

==Progress==
What did you find?

==Completion==
So he is the mastermind behind the iron dwarves? We must find out what he has been ordering the iron dwarves of [[Dun Argol]] to do.

==Progression==
