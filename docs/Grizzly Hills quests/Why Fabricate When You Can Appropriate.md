==Objectives==
Bring 8 War Golem Parts to [[Raegar Breakbrow]] at [[Prospector's Point]].
* [[War Golem Part]] (8)

==Description==
We've got the blueprints, but we can't do anything with them without parts! We don't have access to a [[foundry]], much less materials, but there's a whole load of parts up in [[Dun Argol]].

Your job?

Give them a new home.

They're likely to be scattered around any of the buildings where the iron rune-smiths are working, and I wouldn't blame the irons for being cranky when you try to filch their handiwork. The more parts you can bring, the better we can make this golem.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
I see you made it out in one piece. Do you have the parts?

==Completion==
<Raegar wipes his forehead with the back of his hand.>

Oh, no. This is going to be harder than I thought. These things don't have serial numbers or anything, do they?

Never a [[gnome]] around when you need one...
