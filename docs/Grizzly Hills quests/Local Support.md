==Objectives==
[[Lieutenant Dumont]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]] wants you to go to [[Evergreen Trading Post]] and obtain the Cedar Chest.
*[[Cedar Chest]]

==Description==
We've reached a deadlock with the [[Horde]] in [[Grizzly Hills]]. Our forces are just about evenly matched and all signs so far have pointed to a stalemate.

Until this morning, that is. The local trappers have requested our help. Apparently the Horde took something that belongs to them... a relic of some sort.

We get this back for them and they'll give us the edge we need. Head to the Evergreen Trading Post, west of Conquest Hold and look for a cedar chest.

==Rewards==
You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| |Bramble-Proof Leggings|Patchhide Pants|Legguards of Swift Pursuit|Snaptooth Legplates|Injured Trapper's Cloak}}

==Progress==
You bring me that box, <name>?

==Completion==
It's locked, isn't it?  It looks pretty ordinary.

<Lieutenant Dumont Shakes the chest, producing a rattling wooden sound.>

No matter, I suppose. If this gets us the edge we need against the Horde, then I could care less if the cure for the [[Plague of Undeath|Plague]] was in there.

==Notes==
The Evergreen Trading Post has been taken over by grunts from [[Conquest Hold]]. It's located on the otherside of Conquest from Amberpine to the southwest at {{coords|16|65|Grizzly Hills}}
