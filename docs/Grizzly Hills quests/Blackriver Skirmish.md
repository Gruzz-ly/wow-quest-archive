==Objectives==
[[Scout Captain Carter]] wants you to kill 10 [[Conquest Hold Raider|Horde units]] or [[player]]s in the [[Blackriver Logging Camp]].
*[[Horde]] in Blackriver slain (10)

==Description==
The [[Venture Company]]'s on its way out of [[Grizzly Hills]]. They used to run logging operations here, but things got a little too dangerous for them.

Their abandoned sites are up for grabs and we sure as hell can't let the Horde get their hands on them.

The [[Blackriver Logging Camp]] is the smallest of the three logging sites in this [[zone]], but we still need it. Do your part and fend off the Horde forces. Any lumber they get here will be made into [[weapon]]s to be used against us elsewhere.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60}}
*20750 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)
*+125 [[reputation]] with [[Alliance Vanguard]]
*+250 reputation with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
How's the hunt going?

==Completion==
Nice work, <[[name]]>.  We could use a few more folks like you up here.  We could really show the Horde not to mess with us.

==Notes==
*In this quest you don't need to kill just Horde players. You may kill [[Conquest Hold Raider]]s.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
