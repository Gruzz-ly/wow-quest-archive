==Objectives==
[[Sasha]] wants you to kill 12 [[Solstice Hunter]]s in [[Solstice Village]].
* [[Solstice Hunter]] slain (12)

==Description==
This thing... this curse... that's affecting Silverbrook and [[Solstice Village]]... it makes beasts out of people.

My father tried to warn them, but they all listened to the [[wolfcult]] instead.

They're too far gone now, it's time to put them down... for their own sake. 

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| 
|Bloody Bulwark
|Wolfslayer's Crest
|Scepter of Passionate Reprisal
|Staff of Righteous Vengeance}}
You will also receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Have you taken care of the hunters in the village yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Killing these monsters won't bring my father back... but that's not the point now, is it?

==Notes==
[[Mikhail's Journal]] explains that Sasha's father sent her off while trying to reason with the wolfcultists.
