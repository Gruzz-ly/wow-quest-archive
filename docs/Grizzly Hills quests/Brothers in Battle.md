==Objectives==
Kill 10 Runic Battle Golems and return to [[Brugar Stoneshear]] at the [[Westfall Brigade Encampment]].
* [[Runic Battle Golem]] slain (10)

==Description==
I hope [[Gryan Stoutmantle|Gryan]] knows I withdrew my men from [[Thor Modan]] when the battle began. There's no way we can excavate anything until that place settles down.

You seem like a brave sort, though, and you have Stoutmantle's trust.

Thor Modan is just to the northeast of us and the battle still rages between our [[Earthen]] brothers and the creations of those accursed [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]]. Help our brethren to even the odds and I'll start figuring out how we're going to accomplish this survey of Thor Modan. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
How are things at Thor Modan?

==Completion==
<Brugar listens to your report.>

It sounds like things may be calming down there a bit. We'll start looking for entrances to the iron dwarves' tunnel system. 

==Progression==
