==Objectives==
Recover [[Missing Journal Page]]s, combine them with the Incomplete Journal, and return the completed journal to [[Torthen Deepdig]] at the [[Westfall Brigade Encampment]].
* [[Brann Bronzebeard's Journal]]
* [[Incomplete Journal]] (provided)

==Description==
This battered, mud-stained journal has seen better days. Leafing through the pages, you discover dozens of notes, diagrams, and maps.

The author's handwriting seems vaguely familiar, but you're unable to place it until you discover an entry signed with the name of [[Brann Bronzebeard]].

The back half of the book, containing the most recent entries, has been torn away. Pages litter the battlefield, and it will be impossible to know what Brann discovered here until the book is whole again.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
What's that you have there?

==Completion==
You found Brann's journal? Incredible! The [[Explorers' League|league]] hasn't gotten a report from him in some time, and we began to fear he may have been captured or killed. What did he discover inside [[Thor Modan]]?

==Notes==
{{item|Missing Journal Page|Missing Journal Pages}} can be found laying scattered around [[Thor Modan]].  Very rarely, a [[Runic Battle Golem]] might carry one.

On completion:
:<font color=orange>Torthen Deepdig reads through the most recent entries in Brann's journal.</font>
:<font color="#FFFF9F">Torthen Deepdig says: It says here that Brann discovered a mysterious runic plate deep in Thor Modan!
:Torthen Deepdig says: Brann writes that he was working on a guide to these runic symbols when the giants and their allies attacked.
:Torthen Deepdig says: He reports deciphering part of the writing on the runic plate, but it doesn't look like he recorded his translation.
:Torthen Deepdig says: By [[Magni Bronzebeard|Magni's]] beard, we've got to construct the runic key he used to read the plate. We could be right on his heels!</font>
