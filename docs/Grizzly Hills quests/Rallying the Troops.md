==Objectives==
Use the Shard of the Earth to rally the [[Grizzly Hills Giant]]s fighting in the [[Boulder Hills]], kill any [[Iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] who oppose you, then report to [[Kurun]] on the hill overlooking [[Thor Modan]].
* [[Grizzly Hills Giant]]s Rallied (5)
* [[Iron Rune Avenger]]s Slain (5)
* [[Shard of the Earth]] (provided)

==Description==
The sons of iron have used their runes to enthrall many of my brothers and are using them to break the siege on Thor Modan. I wish we did not have to fight them, but we have no choice.

My giants will not hold out long against them.

I have imbued this earthen shard with a blessing that will aid our allies. Take it with you to the battle in the Boulder Hills to the north, and use it to reassure and fortify my brethren.

Kill any iron dwarves who would stand in your way. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Have you conveyed my blessing upon the giants?

==Completion==
You have given our allies the strength to fight on, and for that you have my thanks. Even so, we must begin planning a way to end this battle before we are overrun.

==Notes==
Use the shard on the giants fighting the [[Runed Giant]]s, which will heal them to full health, increasing their size and their strength. The Runed Giants will then call upon their iron dwarf allies, who will drill up through the ground in a machine and fight you.

==Progression==
{{:Find Kurun!}}
