Finishes the Alliance quest chain starting with [[The Hills Have Us]], and leads to the neutral chain starting with [[Ruuna's Request]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Ruuna the Blind]] at [[Ruuna's Camp]] near [[Vordrassil Pass]].

==Description==
Hey there. I overheard what you were saying to [[Gryan Stoutmantle|the captain]] and I just want you to know... things aren't that simple in [[Northrend]].

Just because [[Archmage Arugal|someone]]'s dead it doesn't mean they're [[Shade of Arugal|out of the picture]].

Southwest of here, near [[Vordrassil Pass]], lives a blind woman who goes by the name Ruuna the Blind. They say she speaks to the dead and has visions of the past and future.

I haven't heard your whole story but it sounds like she'd be right up your alley. 

==Completion==
You seek knowledge beyond your reach so you've come to me. I must warn you, stranger, the answers I provide might not be to your liking.

==Notes==
Ruuna's Camp is just south of Vordrassil.

==Progression==
{{:Local Support}}
Leads to the neutral chain starting with [[Ruuna's Request]].
