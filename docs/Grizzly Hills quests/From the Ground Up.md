==Objectives ==
Bring 8 War Golem Parts to [[Prospector Rokar]] at [[Camp Oneqwah]].
*[[War Golem Part]] (8)

==Description==
We don't have enough time for me to forge the parts myself, but the [[Foundry|foundries]] over at [[Dun Argol]], to the southeast, are working day and night to churn out golem parts.

I think you should go back there and pick up enough of them for me to make a golem from this blueprint.

They're probably scattered around any of the buildings where the iron rune-smiths are working.

Please hurry, <name>. That Tormak looks like he's just waiting for an excuse to carry out his threat!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|90|}}
*20950 [[XP]] (or {{cost|12|57|}} compensation at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Progress==
D-did you b-b-bring those golem parts?

==Completion==
<Rokar wipes his forehead with the back of his hand.>

Oh, thank the Light. He was threatening not to feed me until you returned. Let's sort through this pile of parts and see what we can make.

==Notes==
The parts are scattered on the ground in and around the buildings in [[Dun Argol]].
