'''The Conquest Pit: Bear Wrestling''' is part of the The Conquest Pit chain in Conquest Hold in the Grizzly Hills. It is similar to the Ring of Blood quests in Nagrand. A prot tank and a healing class can duo this fight, but 3 to 5 makes it very easy.

==Objectives==
Defeat [[Ironhide]] inside the Conquest Pit and speak to bookie Vel'jen for a reward.

==Description==
So you're interested in the fights, eh? Well, Krenna has outlawed pit-fighting for all enlisted combatants. But you, my friend, are technically a free agent and are not included in this prohibition.

Nice loophole, eh?

Anyway, if you're interested I can start you off with something easy, a measly bear. I'll even let you bring friends along!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*25950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's not over until you or the bear tips over, friend!

==Completion==
Nice work, mon!  Here's your cut.

==Notes==
This quest is not available until completing [[Delivery to Krenna]], [[Tactical Clemency]] and [[Attack on Silverbrook]].
