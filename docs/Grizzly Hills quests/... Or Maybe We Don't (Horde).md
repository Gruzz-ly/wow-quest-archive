==Objectives==
Charge your [[Depleted War Golem|War Golem]] with the energy from 10 [[Lightning Sentry|Lightning Sentries]] and return to [[Prospector Rokar]] at [[Camp Oneqwah]].
* Charge Level (10)
*[[Golem Control Unit (depleted)]] (provided)

==Description==
The golem's cells have just enough power to run it at the lowest levels, but it can't power any of its combat systems.

The good news is that the perimeter of [[Dun Argol]] is patrolled by lightning sentries. We should be able to use their power to charge up the golem's weapon systems.

Bring the golem with you, take it close to them, it will absorb the power as the sentries die.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|90}}
* 20950 [[XP]] (or {{cost|12|57||}} at level 80)

==Progress==
Did you get that golem charged? Tormak is getting impatient again...

==Completion==
Well, now [[Tormak the Scarred|Tormak]] can't complain anymore. This baby's as ready as I can make it.

After you tear your way through Dun Argol with it, that overgrown cow'll have to release me.

==Notes==
The [[Lightning Sentry|Lightning Sentries]] drop totems that attack for ~1k nature damage, so destroy them quick!
