==Objectives==
[[Torthen Deepdig]] at the [[Westfall Brigade Encampment]] wants you to decipher the three Rune Plates.
* First Prophecy Deciphered
* Second Prophecy Deciphered
* Third Prophecy Deciphered
* [[Runic Keystone]] (provided)

==Description==
[[File:Rune Plate.jpg|thumb|The rune plates seal the doors.]]
We've no time to lose! Now that we've reassembled the runic keystone—well, most of it—we can decipher the contents of those very same runic plates [[Brann Bronzebeard|Brann]] was working on before he fled.

We have no way of knowing if he managed to read the contents of all three plates, but we'll have to assume he got enough information to determine his next destination.

Stand before each of the plates and use the keystone to determine the contents of each. Brann may be counting on us!

==Rewards==
You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards:

You will also receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
What've you found out?

==Completion==
<Torthen listens as you recount the contents of the runic plates.>

By [[Madoran Bronzebeard|Madoran's]] hammer, he discovered a whole new [[titan]] city!

'The cradle of stone and iron.'

'[[Ulduar]] nestled in the [[Storm Peaks|storm]].'

What d'you suppose that means? Could it be where we come from, after all these years?

We have to follow him! We have to find him!

==Notes==
The prophecies can be found on the closed doors in the tunnel. Wander around; #1 is on the north side, #2 and 3 are on the south.

[[First Rune Plate|First Prophecy]]: 'Shall return to the cradle of iron and stone.'

[[Second Rune Plate|Second Prophecy]]: 'Return to Ulduar, nestled in the embrace of the storm.'

[[Third Rune Plate|Third Prophecy]]: 'Greatest of the Maker's children, arise and claim your birthright.'
