==Trivia==
"Say hello to my little friend" is a famous quote from the movie [[wikipedia:Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]] by the character [[wikipedia:Tony Montana|Tony Montana]].  (The full quote can be found [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/quotes here].)  The person you are sent to for this quest, [[Harkor]], is a dwarf.  Given their past association near [[Zul'Aman (BC Classic)|Zul'Aman]], this is just another "short joke" at dwarves' expense.  Probably.
