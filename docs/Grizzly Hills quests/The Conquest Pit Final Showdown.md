==Objectives==
Defeat [[Conqueror Krenna|Krenna]] in the [[Conquest Pit]] and speak to [[Gorgonna]] for a reward.
*Krenna defeated
*Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
You must've really upset Krenna. She and Gorgonna have had a spat and you're wanted in the pit immediately.

There are some wild rumors that it's a fight to the death! That would be bad news for you, but great news for our business venture!

At any rate, you can't run away from fate... best get in there on the quick and get it over with.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Grips of Torrential Power|Shining Buckle Gauntlets|Handguards of Deluded Might|Charged Earthlink Grips|Handguards of the Sanguine Gladiator}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|17|70}}
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Warsong Offensive]]

==Progress==
It is good to see you, <name>.

==Completion==
What happened today... had to happen.  It doesn't mean I have to be happy about it.

I've freed my people from a tyrant, but I've also lost a sister.  I thank you for your help, <name>.  I wish to be alone now.

==Notes==
;Before the fight, Gorgonna and Krenna have words. [[Anthis]] and [[Sethyel]] join her in this fight.
:{{text|say|Gorgonna|I see you've brought your pets.}}
:{{text|say|Conqueror Krenna|Good one, sister. What about your pet? Where is <player>?}}
:{{text|say|Gorgonna|It doesn't have to end this way, you know?}}
:{{text|say|Conqueror Krenna|You went behind my back. You neglected my orders. You will pay the price.}}
:{{text|say|Gorgonna|I used good judgment when you showed none. I don't want to see you lead us into ruin, Krenna!}}
:{{text|say|Conqueror Krenna|Enough talk! By the time, I'm through with you, not even the worgs are going to want to go near your corpse.}}
:{{text|say|Gorgonna|We'll see about that.}}

Attacking Krenna [[PvP flag|flags you for PvP]].

;Conqueror Krenna is slain
:{{text|say|Gorgonna|Why... why sister? Why did it have to come to this?}}
