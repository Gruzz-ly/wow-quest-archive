==Objectives==
[[Master Woodsman Anderhol|Anderhol]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]] wants you to find and kill 6 Graymist Hunters in [[Grizzly Hills]].
* [[Graymist Hunter]] slain (6)

==Description==
As if we didn't have enough to concern ourselves with....

With the present food crisis, we find ourselves competing for food with the local [[worg]]s. The situation is becoming more dire, and I fear that if we don't address the issue immediately we'll soon find ourselves with nothing to hunt.

Scour the forest, <race>. Kill any graymist you find. Recent reports have sighted a concentration of them south of the river west of here.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|40}}

==Progress==
A few less words hunting these forests, I trust?

==Completion==
Good work, <class>.

This should help ensure that the wildlife in these parts ends up where it should - roasting over our fires.
