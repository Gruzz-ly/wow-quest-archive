==Objectives==
Bring an Overseer's Uniform to [[Mountaineer Kilian]] at [[Prospector's Point]].
* [[Overseer's Uniform]]

==Description==
If, as [[Prospector Varana]] said, only certain [[iron dwarf|irons]] are permitted to communicate with this [[Loken|Kronus]], it'll probably be the [[Iron Rune Overseer|overseers]] who have the privilege.

We have to get you in there to see what all this is about, but it won't be easy. The first step will be to get a proper uniform for you.

Then, we'll worry about doing your makeup.

Find one of the overseers at [[Dun Argol]], kill him, and bring back his uniform. If you get blood on it, you'll have only yourself to blame.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Did you get the uniform? 

==Completion==
<Kilian takes the uniform from you.>

This should do. I won't have time to sew on a little patch with '<name>' embroidered on it or anything, but anyone looking closely at you should be convinced that you're an overseer by the time we're done with you.
