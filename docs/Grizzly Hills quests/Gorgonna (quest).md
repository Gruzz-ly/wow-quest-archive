==Objectives==
Bring Mikhail's Journal to [[Gorgonna]] in [[Conquest Hold]].
* [[Mikhail's Journal]] (provided)

==Description==
This book is written in the pig-tongue the humans use. It needs to be burned immediately.

Hand it to my sister Gorgonna and do not waste my time.

==Progress==
You have something to show me?

==Completion==
Could it be? The man who wrote this journal feared for his daughters' lives so he sent them away from Silverbrook.

We just captured an outcast in the outskirts of town about the same as the eldest daughter.

Listen, <name>. There's more happening here than meets the eye... we can't just burn this diary.
