==Objectives==
[[Master Woodsman Anderhol|Anderhol]] in [[Amberpine Lodge]] wants you to take the [[Anderhol's Slider Cider]] and use the nearby outhouse to retrieve the Partially Processed Amberseeds.
* [[Partially Processed Amberseeds]]

==Description==
Alright, <race>. Here's the juice.

It works immediately, so don't use it until you're safely inside the outhouse.

Now go get me those seeds!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Rancid Signet|Fetid Loop|Mildly Tarnished Ring}}

==Progress==
Got those seeds for me yet, <race>?

==Completion==
Well, <name>? Everything come out okay?

Hmm, looks like we caught 'em just in time....

==Aftermath==
After turning the quest in, the following exchange happens:

:{{text|say|Master Woodsman Anderhol says: Alright Ben. We've retrieved the amberseeds again. You know the drill.}}
:{{text|say|[[Benjamin Jacobs]] says: I know, I know. Back in the bucket....}}

Given how this quest line begins, there should have been an epic-quality toothbrush included as a quest reward...
