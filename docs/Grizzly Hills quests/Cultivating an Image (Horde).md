==Objectives==
Use Rokar's Camera to record the images of 8 [[Iron dwarf|Iron Dwarves]] in [[Dun Argol]], then return to [[Scout Vor'takh]] at [[Camp Oneqwah]].
*Iron Dwarf Images Captured (8)
*[[Rokar's Camera]] (provided)

==Description==
Now we have to finish the job of making you as repulsive as those iron dwarves.

The best way to do that is to base your disguise on the ugly mugs of real iron dwarves.

When [[Tormak the Scarred|Tormak]]'s hunting party discovered that [[Prospector Rokar|wayward prospector]], they took the camera he carried. Now, I suppose, we'll get the chance to use it.

Take it with you to Dun Argol, kill some iron dwarves, and record their likenesses in this device. Bring it back once you have enough examples.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Did you get those snapshots?

==Completion==
These should serve. By Garrosh, these creatures are ugly.

==Progression==
{{The Damaged Journal}}
