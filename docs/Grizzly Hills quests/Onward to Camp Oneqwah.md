==Objectives==
Speak with [[Scout Vor'takh]] at [[Camp Oneqwah]].

==Description==
While we build Conquest Hold, I sent Scout Vor'takh to make contact with our taunka allies in the east. They're based in Camp Oneqwah, which is in the easternmost part of Grizzly Hills, beyond Grizzlemaw.

Make the journey there, hear Vor'takh's report and offer your assistance with anything he and the local chieftain may need. Your contributions to Conquest Hold have been exemplary and I know Vor'takh will be grateful for the assistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5200 [[XP]]  (or {{cost|2|49|}} compensation at level 80)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[The Taunka]]

==Completion==
<You offer a short introduction, explaining you were sent by Sergeant Nazgrim.>

Ah, so you're something in the way of reinforcements, then. Good.

Tormak and his men have need of your blade.
