==Objectives==
[[File:Giant Pearl.jpg|thumb|Giant Pearl and Gem-Eyes]]
Collect the Giant Pearl and deliver it to the [[Glimmerfin Oracle]].
* [[Giant Pearl]] {{co|21.8|95.6|Grizzly Hills}}

==Description==
<The oracle draws a circle in the sand, then points down into the deeps. There is something round down there that she is after, perhaps a pearl or stone?

The oracle motions for you to wait a moment before you leave. She waves her hands around frantically, then places them under her mouth, mimicking two large fangs.

You take this as a warning that there may be [[Gem-Eyes|something waiting]] for you in the icy darkness.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||40}}
* 150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The oracle looks at you.>

==Completion==
<The oracle takes the pearl from you and rubs it gently before peering deeply into its shimmering depths.>

==Notes==
Outside the ship to the southeast in the [[fatigue]] zone is an underwater structure guarded by [[Gem-Eyes]]. Get in, loot the pearl, and get out.
