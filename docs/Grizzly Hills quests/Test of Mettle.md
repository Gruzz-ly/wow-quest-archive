==Objectives==
Find {{NPC|Horde|Sergeant Bonesnap}} northwest of [[Silverbrook]] and pass the Test of Mettle.
* Test of Mettle
* [[Bloodied Scalping Knife]] (provided)

==Description==
Alright, friend. You've done us a favor or two, but that's not the true test of a person's courage.

Around these parts, you're not a real [[hunter]] unless you wear your prey's skin.

<Sergei unsheathes his skinning knife and hands it to you.>

The leader of those motherless [[orc]]s attacking our town is called Bonesnap; you'll find him at a[[Bonesnap's_Camp| camp]] further northwest.

That's right. You're going to skin the monster.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15550 [[XP]] (or {{cost|7|47}} at level 80)

==Progress==
The people in Silverbrook ... they're not what they seem.

==Completion==
Don't do it, <name>.  The people that sent you here.... you shouldn't trust them.

==Notes==
Bonesnap comes with two guards.

Upon killing Bonesnap...
:{{Text|say|Captured Trapper|Stop! Put that knife away. You don't have to do... whatever they sent you to do. You're not like them yet!}}

Upon completion:
:{{Text|say|Captured Trapper|Thank you. I... I should get going now.}}
