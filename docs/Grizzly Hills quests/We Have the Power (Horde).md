==Objectives==
Bring Durar's Power Cell and Kathorn's Power Cell to [[Prospector Rokar]] at [[Camp Oneqwah]].
*[[Durar's Power Cell]]
*[[Kathorn's Power Cell]]

==Description==
Well, we've got the shell of a golem, but that's not good enough for [[Tormak the Scarred|Tormak]]. He doesn't realize that these things don't just come together and miraculously start working! We're going to need power cells to animate it.

When I was in [[Dun Argol]], I noticed that [[Rune-Smith Durar]] and [[Rune-Smith Kathorn]] were the ones who manufactured the cells. We'll need one from each to power our golem.

You should be able to find each rune-smith in his workshop on the central level of Dun Argol.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Well, did you get those power cells?

==Completion==
<Rokar takes the batteries from you.>

These are low, but they'll be enough to start up the golem. He's nowhere near ready for battle, though.

==Progression==
{{:An Intriguing Plan}}
