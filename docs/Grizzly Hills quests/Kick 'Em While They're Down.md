==Objectives==
[[Sergeant Hartsman]] wants you to defeat 15 Horde units or players in [[Blue Sky Logging Grounds]].
*[[Wounded Skirmisher|Horde unit]]s eliminated (15)

==Description==
It is a dark day for the [[Alliance]]. Many good men lay dead or dying here. Our only consolation is that they fought well and brought down many of the enemy with them.

With the bulk of our forces committed to Venture Bay we stand alone to weather this storm. The resources in this region are vital to the Alliance and may well make the difference in our struggle against the Horde. We must not fail!

Go, <[[name]]>. Strike at them while they lick their wounds. Avenge your fallen brothers and keep our hopes alive!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60|}}
*20750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)
*+125 [[reputation]] with [[Alliance Vanguard]]
*+250 reputation with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Progress==
How goes the fight, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>.

You've bought us some time here, though likely no more than a day. Nevertheless, the Alliance is grateful for your efforts.

==Notes==
*In this quest you don't need to kill just Alliance players. You may kill [[Wounded Skirmisher]]s

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
