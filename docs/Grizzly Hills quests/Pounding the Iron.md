==Objectives==
Kill any 10 [[Iron dwarf|Iron Dwarves]] defending [[Thor Modan]] and report back to [[Scout Vor'takh]] at [[Camp Oneqwah]].
* Iron Dwarf Defenders Killed (10)

==Description==
The [[Alliance]] isn't the only force opposing us in [[Grizzly Hills]]. The iron dwarves have firm control of the eastern coast, although Thor Modan, to the northeast, is besieged by [[stone giant]]s.

A skilled warrior uses an enemy's weakness against him and we would be fools to ignore the vulnerability of the iron dwarves at Thor Modan. Show the iron dwarves no mercy. Slay any and all who would stand in your way.

The 'sons of iron' will learn to fear the Horde. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{Cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Have you moved against the iron dwarves as I asked?

==Completion==
<Scout Vor'takh smiles.>

Thor Modan is on the verge of collapse, then?

Very well. We will soon turn our attention to [[Dun Argol]].
