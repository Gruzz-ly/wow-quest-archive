==Objectives==
[[Synipus]] at [[Blue Sky Logging Grounds]] wants you to bring 3 [[Broken-down Shredder]]s back to him.
*Shredder Delivered (3)

==Description==
Listen, pal. Why don't ya roll up your sleeves and grab a wrench? There's work to be done! They need these [[shredder]]s refurbished and sent down to Venture Bay, and they need it done yesterday....

No wrench? Well what good are ya then? May as well go down with the rest of the lugheads and play with the [[Horde]]!

While you're there, see if you can drive some of those broken-down shredders up here for repairs. Be careful! They're in pretty bad shape.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|c={{cost|5|60}}
|Key to Refurbished Shredder}}
*20750 [[XP]] (or {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)

==Progress==
No time for chit-chat. These shredders might tip the balance for the [[alliance]]!

==Completion==
<Synipus whistles.>

Oh, she's a beauty! We'll fix her up nice.

If you're short on things to do, go talk to [[Gordun]] and get a ride down to [[Venture Bay]]. They're sure to need a hand.

Oh, and while you're there, use these keys on a [[Refurbished Shredder]]. Wait 'til ya see what these babies can do when they're cleaned up!
