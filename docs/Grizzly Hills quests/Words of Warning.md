==Description==
Thanks for helping me, <name>. My name's Sasha. Listen, I have to get the hell out of here.

The people that sent you here... my people... they've changed. They're not good people anymore... and they want to turn you into one of... one of them.

This... 'test' they sent you on is just the beginning.

Head to the northwestern end of Silverbrook. You'll find something of interest to you.

Good luck... and trust no one.

==Completion==
Who's there?  Are you here to kill me?

Please!  You don't have to do this!
