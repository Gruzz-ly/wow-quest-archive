==Objectives==
Speak to [[Sergeant Nazgrim]] in [[Conquest Hold]].

==Description==
The Horde is a magnificent war machine and you are nothing but a cog.

I am in charge of securing fuel for this machine. If I fail, the machine fails.

Lumber, ore, water... it's all here and we want it. And so does the [[Alliance]].

Before we can move against the human scum, we need to solidify our control over the western region.

Speak to [[Sergeant Nazgrim]] about eradicating the [[vrykul]] in [[Voldrune]] and then maybe - if you turn out to not be a complete failure - we'll send you on further tasks.

==Completion==
So Krenna sent you to me?  She must've not liked you very much, but then again who does she like?

Cracking this vrykul outpost is going to be a tough, tough job.
