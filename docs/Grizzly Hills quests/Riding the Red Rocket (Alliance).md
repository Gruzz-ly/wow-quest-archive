==Objectives==
[[Commander Howser]] at the lighthouse in [[Venture Bay]] wants you to destroy the [[Horde]] lumber shipment.

Commander Howser will only be present at the lighthouse when the [[Alliance]] has it in their possession.
*Horde Lumberboat destroyed

==Description==
Listen, <name>. This battle is as much over resources as tactical supremacy.

I have a mission that could turn the tide in our struggle against the Horde here. We have a chance to strike a critical blow against them and the window could close at any moment.

There are [[Rocket Propelled Warhead|torpedoes]] at the end of the dock that we can use to take down the Horde's lumber ship to the northwest.

You'll need to get some of the [[Element 115|fuel]] that's stored on the docked goblin ship, then ride one of the torpedoes into their transport!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60|a-hp=3}}
*20750 [[XP]] (or a {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)

==Progress==
Has that Horde lumber ship been burned yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Good to see that you survived that impact. Quite the explosion!

We can't afford for the Horde to make off with all that lumber.

Well done, <class>.

==Notes==
* To do this quest, you first need [[Element 115]] from the middle of three ships docked in the port {{co|16.25|80.50|Grizzly Hills}}
* With this, you can power a [[Rocket Propelled Warhead]] from the southern most dock  {{co|13.75|89.00|Grizzly Hills}}
* Now navigate the rocket, without hitting the icebergs, to the Horde Lumber Ship {{co|9.75|78.75|Grizzly Hills}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
