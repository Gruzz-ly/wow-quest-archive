During the fighting against the Silverbrook Hunters, you are likely to encounter [[Mikhail's Journal]], which leads to the next section of this quest chain.  If not, slay a few more hunters until you find it.

==Objectives==
[[Lieutenant Dumont]] wants you to go to [[Forest's Edge Post]] and slay Vladek and 7 Silverbrook Hunters.
* [[Silverbrook Hunter]] slain (7)
* [[Vladek]] slain

==Description==
Our response must be immediate. Decisive. We must teach these savages not to cross us.

Our scouts have located what's left of the Silverbrook trappers... you know, the ones you didn't get to douse in flames. Apparently they're blockading the road to the southeast... perhaps they're trying to box us in.

Head to the Forest's Edge post and take care of them. Their leader's reported to be a man named Vladek... make sure he's dealt with.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
Is it done, <name>?

==Completion==
It's a shame those trappers turned out to be... afflicted.  We sure could've used a few more fighting men.

May the poor souls rest in peace. 

==Notes==
Vladek is found at {{coords|36.2|67.9|Grizzly Hills}}, inside the Forest's Edge Post building.
