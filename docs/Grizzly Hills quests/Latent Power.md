==Objectives==
Charge the Shard of Gavrock at the First Ancient Stone, the Second Ancient Stone, and the Third Ancient Stone, then return to [[Gavrock]] at the [[Ruins of Tethys]].
* Power Drawn from First Ancient Stone{{coords|71.2|39.7|Grizzly Hills}}
* Power Drawn from Second Ancient Stone{{coords|78.9|40.0|Grizzly Hills}}
* Power Drawn from Third Ancient Stone{{coords|74.1|44.2|Grizzly Hills}}
* [[Shard of Gavrock]] (provided)

==Description==
While the runes of compulsion are dormant, there is a chance we can release the runed giants.

I will give you a piece of stone that has been part of me since my creation. If properly imbued, it can be used to free the bound giants.

Two ancient stone markers sit atop places of power between the [[Path of Iron]] and the forest's edge—locations your people would call the intersections of [[ley line]]s. The other is on an island at the southern end of these ruins. Charge the shard at each stone and return. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}} ({{cost|12|57}}at level 80)

==Progress==
Did you find the ancient stones?

==Completion==
I can detect the power you've imbued in the shard and I hope it will be enough to break the runic magic.
