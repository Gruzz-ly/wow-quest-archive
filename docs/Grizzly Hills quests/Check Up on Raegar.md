==Objectives==
Speak with [[Raegar Breakbrow]] at [[Prospector's Point]]. 

==Description==
With all the excitement about the army trying to move through [[Thor Modan]], I'd almost forgotten about Raegar's crew down at Prospector's Point.

I sent Raegar and his assistants, along with a mountaineer friend, down to establish a small post near [[Dun Argol]], at the southern end of the [[Eastwind Shore]].

They were to investigate the [[iron dwarf]] presence in the southern hills, but I haven't received any reports yet. Could you check up on them if you're going down that way? 

==Completion==
Hmm... you don't look like a research assistant, which is just as well. The iron dwarves look to be preparing for war, and my research team hasn't returned. We could use some help around here. 

==Notes==
Prospector's Point is north of [[Dun Argol]], at {{coords|77.0|48.7|Grizzly Hills}}.
