==Objectives==
Collect a Warm Seaweed Stalk, a Young Seaweed Stalk, and a Bulbous Seaweed Stalk and deliver them to the [[Glimmerfin Oracle]].
* [[Warm Seaweed Stalk]] {{co|11.2|95.0|Grizzly Hills}}
* [[Young Seaweed Stalk]] {{co|8.9|94.3|Grizzly Hills}}
* [[Bulbous Seaweed Stalk]] {{co|12.7|96.7|Grizzly Hills}}

==Description==
<The{{Sic}} seems quite excited about the presence of the new egg. You get the sense that this is an important occasion for these murlocs--there may be few eggs left.

The oracle waves a small piece of seaweed in front of you, showing you the young buds of the immature plant.

She warps the seaweed around a small part of the egg, then points at you, then back at the wrapped seaweed.

It appears that the egg needs to be wrapped in more immature seaweed stalks.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The oracle blinks at you.>

==Completion==
<The oracle wraps the egg gently in the seaweed.>

==Notes==
This quest also involves a jaunt into the [[fatigue]] waters southwest of the ship. Consider a swim speed potion or an aquatic mount to minimize exposure to fatigue damage ticks. The targeted seaweed stalks are protected by electrified full-size stalks, so dodge them.

==Progression==
{{Glimmerfin}}

==Patch changes==
