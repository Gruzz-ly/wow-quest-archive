==Objectives==
Use [[Flamebringer]] to defeat [[Thane Torvald Eriksson]] and report to [[Sergeant Nazgrim]] at [[Conquest Hold]].
* [[Thane Torvald Eriksson]] slain

==Description==
With the flame-imbued talismans, we can finally challenge the thane.

His favorite mount is a ferocious [[proto-drake]] called Flamebringer. It is kept bound in chains in the western part of [[Voldrune]], but with the power of the talismans, you should be able to bend it to your will and use it against the thane.

Once you have Flamebringer under your control, search the tops of the towers of Voldrune for the thane and use Flamebringer to destroy him.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Headbinder's Crown
|Tunic of the Rectified Thane
|Legguards of Refuted Feudalism
|Skull-Reshaper's Helm
|Thane-Reaper's Signet}}
You will also receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
Have you overcome the thane?

==Completion==
The few remaining Dragonflayers dare not challenge us after your battle with the thane. Show no mercy to our enemies - that is the way of the Horde.

==Notes==
* Even though he is located in Voldrune, his death does count towards the [[Baleheim Bodycount]] (as of 4/4/2010)
* Melee characters with [[Cold Weather Flying]] can attack him in close combat (and complete the quest), where he does not cast all the annoying things he does when riding the drake.
* As of now (11/23) using the proto-drake does not shift druids out of forms, allowing cats and bears to ride Flamebringer.
