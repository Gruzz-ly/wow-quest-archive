==Objectives==
Bring the completed War Golem Blueprint to [[Raegar Breakbrow]] at [[Prospector's Point]].
*[[War Golem Blueprint]]

==Description==
The [[iron dwarf|iron dwarves]] are making no secret of the fact that they're preparing for war. With their [[giant]]s, [[golem]]s, and [[lightning elemental]]s, they'd have a technological advantage against the [[Westfall Brigade]]. If they don't find passage north in time, the irons could take them by surprise.

We've got to tie them up here, and I've got just the way to do it. [[Dun Argol]] is full of rune-smiths churning out war golems. They carry plans for specific pieces, so you'll need to find and assemble all the parts.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Were you able to get those plans from the rune-smiths?

==Completion==
You got all of them? Brilliant! I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when the golem's done.

==Notes==
For this quest, you are looking for [[Golem Blueprint Section 1]], [[Golem Blueprint Section 2]], and [[Golem Blueprint Section 3]], which you then combine into [[War Golem Blueprint]].

[[Iron Rune-Smith]]s drop all three pieces.
