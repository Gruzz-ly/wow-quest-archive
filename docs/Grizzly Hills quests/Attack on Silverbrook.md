==Objectives==
[[Conqueror Krenna]] at [[Conquest Hold]] wants you to slay 8 [[Silverbrook Defender]]s in the [[Silverbrook Hills]].
* [[Silverbrook Defender]] slain (8)

==Description==
A few hours ago, the trappers were nothing but peasants threatening to add their number to the [[Alliance]]'s.

Now they've become something else... an uncertainty. I do not like uncertainties. Go to the hills outside their main town in northern Grizzly Hills, Silverbrook, and help my men crush them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Raiment of the Caged Beast
|Boots of Internal Strife
|Wristguard of the Tormented Soul
|Sabatons of Crushed Humanity
|Worgslayer's Ring}}

==Progress==
Have you completed your task yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Not bad, <name>.  You might be slightly more useful than I initially thought.

==Notes==
The defenders are ''outside'' the village.

==Progression==
