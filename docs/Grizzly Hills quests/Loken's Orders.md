==Objectives==
Disguise yourself as an [[Iron Rune Overseer]], intercept the message from [[Loken]], then report to [[Scout Vor'takh]] at [[Camp Oneqwah]].
* Message from Loken received
* [[Overseer Disguise Kit]] (provided)

==Description==
I've created everything else you'll need for your overseer disguise kit. Try not to retch when you put it on. I took pains to make it as true to reality as possible.

Take the kit with you southeast to [[Dun Argol]], use it to disguise yourself, then go to the easternmost building on the broad middle tier of the city.

There, you should see a pedestal where the thane and overseers receive their orders from this Loken. Activate it while disguised and learn all you can from the communication.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
What did you learn of Loken?

==Completion==
So he means to foment civil war between the factions of the [[titan]]s' creation? Why does this titan city of [[Ulduar]] mean so much to him? I suppose this is what [[Kurun]] and his [[stone giant|giant]]s are hoping to prevent.

Well, I doubt we're in a position to keep the giants from fighting each other, but we can find a way to use this to our advantage. I must inform our leaders at once.

==Notes==
[[Loken's Pedestal]] is at {{coords|81.5|60.3|Grizzly Hills}} in the easternmost building of the middle tier.

When interacting with the pedestal:
:{{text|say|Image of Loken|You're late, overseer.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Loken|Destiny will not wait. Your craftsmen must increase their production of the war golems before the stone giant leader and his army reach Ulduar.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Loken|Tell your rune-smiths to continue converting what stone giants you can. Those that will not submit must be destroyed.}}
:{{text|say|Image of Loken|If the stone giants interfere with our work at Ulduar, I will hold you and your thane responsible. Mortals must not be allowed to come to the aid of the giants.}}
:{{text|say|Return to your duties, overseer. Be certain to impress upon your workers the urgency of their tasks.}}
