==Objectives==
Return to [[Captain Gryan Stoutmantle]] at the [[Westfall Brigade Encampment]]. 

==Description==
It worked! It worked! My comrades can finally enjoy their well-earned rest...

I'll stay here and finish the job. We [[Undead Miner|Hollowstone miners]] always finish the job -- we never give up!

That's why [[Arugal]] made an example of us. We wouldn't fall in line, you see? We wouldn't join his [[wolfcult]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*5250 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|3|15}} at level 80)

==Completion==
Curse our luck.  We find the one functioning [[Hollowstone Mine|mine]] this side of the hills and it's full of [[Scourge]].

No offense, friend.  But that survivor you found sounds like he's been a little traumatized due to losing his friends.  Arugal's been dead for years... I even saw his grave once.
