==Objectives==
Kill 12 [[Dragonflayer Huscarl]]s and return to [[Sergeant Nazgrim]] at [[Conquest Hold]].
* [[Dragonflayer Huscarl]] slain (12)

==Description==
Preparations for war are underway in the [[vrykul]] village of [[Voldrune]] to the southeast. Voldrune's thane cannot field a large army, but with our forces spread thin, we are still at risk.

We cannot risk giving the thane and his men an opportunity to attack, so we must take the battle to them. If you are truly a <class> of the Horde, you will relish the chance to demonstrate our strength.

Cut down the huscarls and prove to this Dragonflayer clan that the Horde is not to be trifled with! 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Completion==
You have done exactly as I asked. We've got the Dragonflayers on the defensive and it'll soon be time to deal with their leader.

==Progression==
