==Objectives==
[[Hierophant Thayreen]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]] wants you to obtain 8 Crazed Furbolg Blood from the [[Furbolg]]s at [[Heart's Blood Shrine]] and [[Rage Fang Shrine]].
* [[Crazed Furbolg Blood]] (8)

==Description==
The furbolgs that live east of here are more aggressive and bestial than the ones we're used to. Our forces have squared off with them more than once, and the survivors always speak of a dark, slimy substance dripping from their corpses.

Their condition could be linked with the contaminants we found on [[Vordrassil]]'s remains.

Bring me samples of the furbolgs' blood. You will find them in the Rage Fang Shrine and the Heart's Blood Shrine, far to the east. 

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Have you obtained the blood samples, <name>?

==Completion==
The corruption present in this blood is identical to that of the slime. I don't have a good feeling about this.
