==Objectives==
[[Conqueror Krenna]] in [[Conquest Hold]] wants you to slay 8 [[Silverbrook Hunter]]s and their leader, [[Vladek]], at the [[Forest's Edge Post]].
* [[Silverbrook Hunter]] slain (8)
* [[Vladek]] slain

==Description==
If there is one thing I can get through your head, let it be this: the [[Alliance]] will be crushed in the [[Grizzly Hills]].

There is far too much lumber, ore, game and strategic territory for us to give up on any single battlefront here.

So far we've been successful... but there's something that could tip the scales in our enemy's favor.

Far to the east of here, at the [[Forest's Edge Post]], local trappers seek to join the Alliance. Slaughter them before they have the chance to do so.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Bramble-Proof Leggings
|Patchhide Pants
|Legguards of Swift Pursuit
|Snaptooth Legplates
|Injured Trapper's Cloak}}

==Progress==
Did you complete your task? If not, what are you doing here?

==Completion==
You're back. And you're alive.

Now what's this nonsense about worgen?

==Notes==
The post is at {{coords|35.3|67.6|Grizzly Hills}}. Vladek will also drop [[Mikhail's Journal]], which starts the quest [[Mikhail's Journal (quest)]].
