== Objectives ==
Bring an Overseer's Uniform to [[Scout Vor'takh]] at [[Camp Oneqwah]].
* [[Overseer's Uniform]]

== Description ==
It sounds like this [[Loken]] is the mastermind behind the sudden preparations for war on the part of the [[Iron dwarf|iron dwarves]].

Only the highest ranking irons are likely to have access to him, so we'll have to make you into an overseer to find out what's going on in there.

I have a plan, for that, but we'll need some supplies.

Find one of the iron rune overseers at [[Dun Argol]], to the southeast, kill him, and bring back his uniform. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

== Progress ==
Did you get the uniform?

== Completion ==
This should work, but there's still the matter of the rest of your disguise. Even those dimwitted metal dwarves will recognize an impostor with a stolen suit.

==Progression==
