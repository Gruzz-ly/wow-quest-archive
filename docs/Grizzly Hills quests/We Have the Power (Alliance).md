==Objectives==
Bring Durar's Power Cell and Kathorn's Power Cell to [[Raegar Breakbrow]] at [[Prospector's Point]].
*[[Durar's Power Cell]]
*[[Kathorn's Power Cell]]

==Description==
We're almost there, but the war [[golem]] won't run without power cells. From the information I was able to collect in [[Dun Argol]] before we were discovered, both [[Rune-Smith Durar]] and [[Rune-Smith Kathorn]] each create one power cell.

We'll need one power cell from each of the rune-smiths before our golem will work.

You should be able to find each rune-smith in his workshop on the central level of Dun Argol.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Well, did you get those power cells?

==Completion==
<Raegar takes the batteries from you.>

Excellent! We should be all ready to go.

==Progression==
