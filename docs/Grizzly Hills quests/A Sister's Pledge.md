==Objectives==
Look for [[Anya]] in the [[Duskhowl Den]] near [[Solstice Village]]. 

==Description==
Please, <name>. I know it is [[Arugal]] you're after. I swear on my father's memory I will help you take him down.

But I must beg you... Anya is completely innocent, we cannot leave her with these savages.

Help me rescue my sister and you'll have me at your side when you face Arugal.

I know the den [[Anatoly]] spoke of. We'll find it on the other side of this hill. Let's go, my sister's in danger.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*10500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I don't want to be here anymore. The [[worgen]]-men are mean.

==Notes==
The cave's entrance is at {{coords|65.7|43.3|Grizzly Hills}}.

When you turn in the quest, Sasha will run into the den.
