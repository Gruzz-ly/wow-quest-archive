==Objectives==
[[Brugar Stoneshear]] at the [[Westfall Brigade Encampment]] wants you to explore the North Building, the East Building, and the South Building of [[Thor Modan]].
* Investigate North Building
* Investigate East Building
* Investigate South Building

==Description==
The first place we'll search for entrances to the Thor Modan tunnel system will be the outlying buildings.

As I left the site with my men, it looked like the [[iron dwarf]] defenders were taking refuge inside the buildings. Be careful as you explore them.

Any tunnel entrances are likely to be toward the back of the buildings. I'm not sure what [[Gryan Stoutmantle|Stoutmantle]] thinks we're going to find down there, but I doubt the iron dwarves will make the search easy. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
I don't suppose you managed to find the tunnels, did you?

==Completion==
<Brugar utters a stream of foul dwarven words.>

No entrances? None?

No, of course it couldn't be that easy. Well, I suppose there's no avoiding a foray into the city proper. My boys'll never get back to their real work.
