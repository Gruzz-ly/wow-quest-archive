==Objectives==
[[Hierophant Thayreen]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]] wants you to go to [[Vordrassil's Heart]], [[Vordrassil's Tears]] and [[Vordrassil's Limb]] and use the [[Geomancer's Orb]] in the depths beneath the surface.
* Orb used beneath Vordrassil's Heart
* Orb used beneath Vordrassil's Limb
* Orb used beneath Vordrassil's Tears
* [[Geomancer's Orb]] (provided)

==Description==
When the tree [[Vordrassil]] fell, its hollow remains grew roots deep into the ground.

I want you to go north of here to the three locations where the trunk shattered and go as far beneath the ground as you can. You'll find them west of [[Grizzlemaw]].

Use this orb once you get there to get an imprint of the energy surrounding the area. If we're to heal the land, we must first find out what caused Vordrassil to fail as a world tree all those years ago.

==Progress==
Have you done what I asked of you, <name>?

==Completion==
The energy in the orb is... overpowering...

A dark force has tainted the ground near Vordrassil's remains.  We will need to investigate more.

==Notes==
The three locations are marked as a line of caves west-southwest of Grizzlemaw on the zone map. Enter each cave, and head as far down as possible. Look for a black smoke-filled area.
