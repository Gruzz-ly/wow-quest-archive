==Objectives==
Defeat 10 Alliance units or players in [[Venture Bay]] and return to [[Centurion Kaggrum]].
*[[Alliance]] killed in Venture Bay (10)

==Description==
This wretched [[Westfall Brigade]] is proving a tougher opponent than we'd thought. Though few in number, they fight well and bravely, but we cannot afford to wait them out.

Conqueror Krenna's orders were to capture the port quickly. You must break the stalemate, <name>. Find the enemy's [[Westfall Brigade Marine|marines]] and slaughter them until the resistance ceases. Only then will we be able to claim ownership of the port.

Go quickly. We don't want to keep [[Conqueror Krenna]] waiting.

==Rewards==

|q=10|item=Venture Coin}}
*20750 (or {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)

==Progress==
Have you done as ordered?

==Completion==
The port will soon fall to us. You have done well this day, <name>.
