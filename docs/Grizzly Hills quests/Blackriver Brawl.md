==Objectives==
[[Raider Captain Kronn]] wants you to slay 10 [[Amberpine Scout|Alliance units]] or [[player]]s at the [[Blackriver Logging Camp]].
*[[Alliance]] in Blackriver slain (10)

==Description==
The [[Venture Company]] abandoned operations shortly after we showed up. Clearly they were afraid of what we were going to do to their greedy little hides.

With them gone, their logging camps are up for grabs. Our war machine is a hungry beast... without renewing our supplies we won't make it to [[Icecrown]].

Unfortunately the Alliance seems to have the same idea and we must make sure we're the ones that prevail. Head into the logging camp and help us fight the Alliance scum.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|5|60}}
*20750 (or a {{cost|9|96|}} compensation at level 80)
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Horde Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you slain the Alliance dogs? Victory must be ours!

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Our control over the logging camp might not be complete yet, but thanks to you we're one step closer to smashing these Alliance worms.

==Notes==
*In this quest you don't need to kill just Alliance players. You may kill [[Amberpine Scout]]s

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.0.2|note=Added.}}
