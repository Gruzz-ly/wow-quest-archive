==Objectives==
Using the abilities of your War Golem, defeat Iron Thane Furyhammer, then return to [[Raegar Breakbrow]] at [[Prospector's Point]].
* [[Iron Thane Furyhammer]] slain
* [[Golem Control Unit (charged)]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that you've charged up your war golem, we're going to put all that energy to good use. Activate the golem inside [[Dun Argol]] to take control of it.

Our information about Dun Argol's leader, Iron Thane Furyhammer, suggests his bodyguard protects him from all harm.

That bodyguard is the construct he travels with, called [[The Anvil]]. Disable the construct, and his protection will disappear.

The thane stays in the building at the top of Dun Argol and supervises production from the bottom level. 

==Rewards==
You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox|
|Grounded Gloves|Crackpot Spaulders|Short-Circuiting Boots|Golem-Rider's Greaves}}
You will also receive: {{cost|11|80}}

==Progress==
Were you able to get past the iron thane's defenses?

==Completion==
It worked?

<Raegar clears his throat.>

I mean... of course it worked! This is incredible!

Years from now, [[Explorers' League]] initiates will hear the story of how Raegar Breakbrow, <name>, and some hunk o' junk golem defeated the thane of Dun Argol! 

==Notes==
Use the [[Overseer Disguise Kit]] from [[Put on Your Best Face for Loken]] to easily reach Furyhammer and the Dun Argol Power Core for [[Blackout (quest)]].
