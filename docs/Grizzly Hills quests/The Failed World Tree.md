==Objectives==
[[Hierophant Thayreen]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]] wants you to go to [[Vordrassil's Limb]], [[Vordrassil's Heart]] or [[Vordrassil's Tears]] and obtain 6 Slime Samples from the [[Entropic Ooze]]s.
* [[Slime Sample]] (6)

==Description==
My ancestors once planted a tree in the middle of the [[Grizzly Hills]].

It was called [[Vordrassil]] and it was to become a world tree.

For reasons long forgotten, after the tree was fully grown, they decided it needed to be destroyed. Its giant trunk splintered at three locations in the area to the north.

Where the tree touched the ground, foul ooze began to crawl the earth. Bring me slime samples so I can begin my work and the earth can be healed.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Have you gathered the samples, <name>? 

==Completion==
The slime is not natural, <name>.  Its very nature is corrupt and... evil.

We must find out more.

==Notes==
The mobs are found at the three caves marked on the zone map west of Grizzlemaw.

Players will likely not get the required amount of slime if they only kill the mobs required to reach the bottom of each of the three caves.
