==Objectives==
Recover 8 [[Missing Journal Page]]s, combine them with the Incomplete Journal, and return the completed journal to [[Sage Paluna]] at [[Camp Oneqwah]].
* [[Brann Bronzebeard's Journal]]
* [[Incomplete Journal]] (provided)

==Description==
This battered, mud-stained journal has seen better days. Leafing through the pages, you discover dozens of notes, diagrams, and maps in the [[dwarven (language)|dwarven]] language.

The only text you're able to decipher is the name of [[Brann Bronzebeard]] scrawled at the end of one of the entries.

The back half of the book, containing the most recent entries, has been torn away. Someone thought the notes important enough to attempt to destroy them. Perhaps gathering the missing pages from the battlefield will yield some clues. 

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
What's that you have there?

==Completion==
Who is this Brann Bronzebeard? The iron dwarves found no reason to treat with him, but I have no idea why we'd be interesting in his writings.

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Sage Paluna|This is an intriguing find, <name>, but I don't know what to make of it.}}
:{{Text|say|Sage Paluna|The language is unfamiliar and for all we know, it's just some soldier's journal.}}
:{{Text|say|[[Scout Vor'takh]]|Let me take a look at that.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Vor'takh|Hmm...}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Vor'takh|This journal is written in dwarven. I can't read this scrawl, but I can make out one thing.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Vor'takh|'Brann Bronzebeard.' The brother of [[Magni Bronzebeard|Ironforge's king]]? You may have spoken too soon, Paluna.}}
:{{Text|say|Sage Paluna|What do you mean?}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Vor'takh|Think about how valuable a member of the dwarven royal family would be as a hostage.}}
:{{Text|say|Scout Vor'takh|If he's in the area, we must find him. First, though, we'll need a way to decipher this journal.}}
