==Objectives==
Fill a Vial of Moonwell Water and locate [[Lea Stonepaw]] within [[Grizzly Hills]].
* [[Flask of Moonwell Water]]
* Travel through the [[Dreamway]] to Grizzly Hills (Optional)
* Take [[Stonepaw's Hippogryph]] to Lea Stonepaw (Optional)
* Locate Lea Stonepaw

==Description==
It is said that a fragment of [[Ursoc]]'s spirit, his fury and rage, remained within the claws after his death. Only those who have attained mastery of discipline have any hope of wielding them without being overwhelmed by the bear lord's fury.

<Lea looks intently at you for a moment.>

But you are no novice, I can see that clearly.

Very well, draw water from the [[moonwell]] on the northern edge of the grove then come find me. I'll await your arrival within the broken stump of [[Vordrassil]] in [[Northrend]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|9|70|}}
* 7400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you get the moonwell water? It is essential for our task!

==Completion==
Excellent! We will need this water to enter the Emerald Dream. I've prepared offerings for [[Ursol]], brother of [[Urscoc]]. We will need his help to bypass the magical wards placed upon the claws.

Give me a moment... and let us hope [[Ursol]] will aid us.
