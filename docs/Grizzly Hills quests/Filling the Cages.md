==Objectives==
[[Samir]] at [[Granite Springs]] wants you to use the Bounty Hunter's Cage on an [[ice troll]] that's been stunned by [[Budd Nedreck|Budd]].

You must take Budd to the [[Ruins of Drak'Zin]] and speak to him when near a [[Drakkari]] troll.
* Captured Live Ice Troll
* [[Bounty Hunter's Cage]] (provided)

==Description==
'Ol Budd's seen better days.

Ever since our stay in [[Ghostlands]] he's been useless to us. We've had to find ways to make it on our own, and today that means sellin' trolls to the highest bidder.

Fortunately, we've recently found a use for Budd. Something about his condition allows him to mingle with the local trolls, so we taught him a little game that's turned us a tidy profit.

See for yourself. Talk to Budd, take him southwest to Drak' Zin Ruins and use this cage as soon as he tags a troll. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Grinder of Reverse Emancipation|Warbling Crossbow|Mace of Helotry|Spike of Renounced Autonomy|Yoke Slasher|Sword of the Caged Mind}}
You will also receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
Have you managed to cage an ice troll?

==Completion==
Great work, <class>. Looks like we'll be keepin' Budd around a little longer.

We'll have your cage picked up right away. Here's your share of the bounty.

Oh, and welcome to the camp. Stick around and I'm sure we'll find a use for ya.... 

==Notes==
Budd must aggro the troll in order to stun it and knock it out (to do this, use the "sap" option on his pet bar or press Ctrl-4 when you have a troll targeted). Players will have Budd's attention span for 10 minutes, so move quick!
