==Objectives==
Speak to [[Envoy Ducal]] in [[Silverbrook]].

==Description==
We'd been trying to negotiate with the trappers for weeks, but we'd gotten nowhere until you found that blasted chest of theirs.

This should be good news to our envoy in Silverbrook. We sent Ducal there about a week ago and his last letter indicated he'd been making little progress.

Go to Silverbrook and aid him in his diplomatic efforts. Take the roads heading northwest of here and you should find it after crossing a couple of bridges.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|4|98}} at max level)
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Valiance Expedition]]

==Completion==
It's good to finally meet you, <name>!  We'd heard about you up here. Welcome to Silverbrook.

These trappers are a great bunch of lads and lasses. Hardy people, they know the lay of the land really well. You'll find it's a great thing that we finally won them over to our side.
