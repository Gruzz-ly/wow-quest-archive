'''Guardian of the Smallest''' is the final quest in the chain to gain access to [[Glimr]], the purple baby murloc. The quest chain starts with [[Glimmerfin Scale]] outside [[Venture Bay]] in southwestern [[Grizzly Hills]].

==Objectives==
Slay Great Mua'kin and return to the [[Glimmerfin Oracle]].
* [[Great Mua'kin]] slain {{co|8.7|91.2|Grizzly Hills}}

==Description==
<The oracle pats you on the shoulder, and seems quite pleased with all that you've done.

She holds up one finger, then spreads her hands wide and emits a terrible roar-like murgle.

She points outside, then at you, then your weapon, then nods seriously.

There must be one more trial to await you. It would appear to be a test of strength.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Glimr's Cracked Egg]]
* {{cost||1|10}}
* 250 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The oracle claps excitedly.>

==Completion==
<The oracle pats you excitedly on the shoulder, and raises her arm in triumph.

She starts, then points quickly at the egg and rushes over.

The egg begins to hatch...>

==Notes==
The [[Great Mua'kin]] is thankfully not in [[fatigue]] waters off to the west, next to another sunken ship. The quest suggests this is a group quest, but well-geared players can take out the [[makura]] on their own.

==Progression==
{{Glimmerfin}}
