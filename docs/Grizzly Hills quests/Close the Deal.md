==Objectives==
Bring the Cedar Chest to [[Ivan]] at [[Aspen Grove Post]].
*[[Cedar Chest]] (provided)

==Description==
We have what the trappers want. Now it's up to us to sign them up with our side.

Take the chest to a trapper named Ivan at the Aspen Grove Post, just north of here.

If all goes well, we'll have local woodsmen serving as scouts for the king's army in no time. 

==Progress==
You've brought something for us? 

==Completion==
You did it!  You recovered the Sc... you recovered the chest that the Horde stole from us.  We thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
It's implied that the item retrieved was the [[Scythe of Elune]]. However, ''[[Dark Riders (comic)|Dark Riders]]'' and ''[[Curse of the Worgen]]'' would later detail the Scythe's life, and at no point could it have possibly been in Grizzly Hills. If it was meant to be the Scythe, the plot point has been dropped.
