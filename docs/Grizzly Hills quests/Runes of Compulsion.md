==Objectives==
[[Gavrock]], at the [[Ruins of Tethys]], wants you to neutralize the four [[Rune of Compulsion|Runes of Compulsion]] by defeating Overseer Durval, Overseer Korgan, Overseer Lochli, and Overseer Brunon.
* [[Overseer Durval]]{{coords|67.5|29.4|Grizzly Hills}} slain
* [[Overseer Korgan]]{{coords|71.8|34.2|Grizzly Hills}} slain
* [[Overseer Lochli]]{{coords|75.0|37.0|Grizzly Hills}} slain
* [[Overseer Brunon]]{{coords|78.8|43.7|Grizzly Hills}} slain

==Description==
Even as [[Kurun]] attacks [[Thor Modan]], the iron dwarves work their magics against our brothers. Summoning our brothers from the earth, then binding them with runes, the sons of iron force them to war against the children of stone.

Along the [[Eastwind Shore]], they use runes of compulsion to send enslaved giants to the battlefields of the north.

Find the four runes of compulsion and force their overseers to appear by defeating the [[Iron Rune-Weaver|rune-weaver]]s who man each rune. Without the overseers, the runes are useless.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Have you neutralized the runes on the coast?

==Completion==
Good. Now, we must act swiftly, before the sons of iron realize that their runes have been rendered harmless.

==Progression==
{{:Find Kurun!}}
