==Objectives==
[[Sasha]] at the [[White Pine Trading Post]] wants you to go to [[Bloodmoon Isle]] and slay [[Selas]], [[Varlam]], [[Goremaw]] and the [[Shade of Arugal]].
* [[Varlam]] slain
* [[Selas]] slain
* [[Goremaw]] slain
* [[Shade of Arugal]] defeated
* Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
It is time, then, <name>. [[Arugal]] must be defeated.

Get a couple of people you can trust and head for [[Bloodmoon Isle]]. It's just off the coast, east of here.

We'll hit them fast. Take out Arugal's lieutenants—I'll catch up with you when it's time to take out the monster himself.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:{{itembox|
|Furred Worgslayer Spaulders
|Fangsever Shoulderguards
|Keen Razorfang Spaulders
|Worg-Rendering Shoulderguards
|Bone-Polished Iceplate Shoulders}}
You will also receive: {{cost|17|70}}

==Progress==
It's good to see you, <name>.

==Completion==
We got him good, <name>. But not good enough.

One thing's for sure... we won't be seeing him around these parts any longer.

==Notes==
Shade of Arugal is typically the hardest of the targets. He has multiple people surrounding him at the start of the fight that can be taken out separately, but they have quick respawn timers. He also becomes invulnerable and summons adds multiple times during the fight, likely based on his health total. If you have any ranged DPS in the group who are able to fly, have them stand on the parapets along the tower and just DPS the shade to death. The shade's summons and the regular guys on guard won't be able to hit due to their melee range, but the shade casts shadow bolts and won't go into auto-evade mode. Keep anyone who can't help from the parapets away from the top floor room if you try this way.

You can accept this quest from [[Sasha]] while she is with you at [[Duskhowl Den]], after having rescued [[Anya]].
