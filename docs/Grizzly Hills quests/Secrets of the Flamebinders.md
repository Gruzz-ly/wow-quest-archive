==Objectives==
Bring 3 Flame-Imbued Talismans to [[Woodsman Drake]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]].
* [[Flame-Imbued Talisman]] (3)

==Description==
Even as we attempt to fight off the [[Horde]], the [[Dragonflayer]] tribe musters in their village of [[Voldrune]], near the coast to the south.

The most powerful warriors in the village are granted flame-imbued talismans that give them the ability to control powerful, savage [[proto-dragon|proto-drakes]]. If we can gain control of one of these drakes, perhaps we can use it to neutralize the threat posed by Voldrune.

The [[Dragonflayer Flamebinder|Dragonflayer flamebinders]] create the talismans and imbue them with power. Kill them and take the talismans.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
Did you collect those talismans?

==Completion==
With the talismans in hand, the drake will have no choice but to obey you. I can't wait to see the look on the thane's face when he realizes you've commandeered his proto-drake.
