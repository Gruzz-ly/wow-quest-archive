==Objectives==
[[Petrov]] at [[Hollowstone Mine]] wants you to use the Miner's Lantern to burn the corpses of 8 [[Undead Miner|Hollowstone Miners]].
* Miner at Rest (8)
* [[Miner's Lantern]] (provided)

==Description==
<Petrov looks deeply disturbed, breathing heavily and shifting his gaze nervously around the mine.>

My comrades... we must put their souls to rest! I kill them and kill them but.. they just come back!

I've had an idea for a while but I just don't have the heart to do it myself.

Maybe you can do this for me? Take this lantern and use its oil to burn their remains so they never get up again.

I'll answer your questions later. Help my friends first!

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| |Specially Treated Robes
|Bearskin Helm
|Hide-Lined Chestguard
|Carapace of the Fallen}}
You will also receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Have you put my friends to rest yet, <name>?

==Completion==
Rest in peace friends!  Do not worry -- I will tell everyone that we never gave up!
