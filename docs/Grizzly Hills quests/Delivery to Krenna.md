==Objectives==
Take the Bundle of Hides to [[Conqueror Krenna|Krenna]] in [[Conquest Hold]].
* [[Bundle of Hides (Grizzly Hills)]] (provided)

==Description==
This is it, mon. Let's take these hides to Krenna and see if they pass the test.

Let's hope for both our sakes Krenna doesn't notice anything.

==Progress==
Do you have any idea who you're talking to?

==Completion==
Just who do you take me for?  These hides smell of flour!

This is a complete insult to the [[Horde]]!

==Notes==
When turning in the quest:
:Conqueror Krenna says: That spineless troll has failed me for the last time. [[Anthis]]! Break his legs!
:Anthis says: At once, my lady!
:[[Gorgonna]] says: Let me take care of it, sister.
:Conqueror Krenna says: I've never seen you so eager to cause harm to someone, sister. Such a pleasant development... very well, go!
:Gorgonna whispers: What were you thinking, provoking her like that?
''Gorgonna walks up to [[Hidetrader Jun'ik]].''
:Gorgonna says: You... half-idiot! You really did it this time. I'm going to have to make it look like your leg's broken.
:Hidetrader Jun'ik says: No, please! Don't!
:Gorgonna says: Now don't move if you ever want to walk again!
