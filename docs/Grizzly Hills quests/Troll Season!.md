==Objectives==
[[Lieutenant Dumont]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]] wants you to speak to [[Samir]] at [[Granite Springs]]. 

==Description==
You, <race>! No sense standing around here when there's work to be done!

[[Drak'Tharon Keep]] is the most direct route to [[Zul'Drak]]. We MUST capture it to ensure safe passage for the [[Alliance]]. But until we get the numbers to make an assault, we'll have to content ourselves in thinning out the [[ice troll]]s and collecting intel.

To that end, we've conscripted a gang of thugs to capture and deliver live trolls for interrogation. Travel northwest and speak with Samir at Granite Springs. He'll direct you further.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|4|10}}

==Completion==
Here to get in on the bounty action, eh? 

==Progression==
{{:Filling the Cages}}
