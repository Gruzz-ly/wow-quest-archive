==Objectives==
Kill 12 Dragonflayer Huscarls and return to [[Woodsman Drake]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]].
* [[Dragonflayer Huscarl]] slain (12)

==Description==
There's a flurry of activity down in [[Voldrune]] village to the south. [[Thane Torvald Eriksson]] and his huscarls are preparing for war. With most of our men in the field dealing with the [[Horde]]'s treachery, Amberpine will be vulnerable.

Travel to Voldrune, which is near the southern coast, and show those [[Dragonflayer]]s we're no soft target.

Slay as many of the huscarls as you can find. Make them think twice about taking advantage of our conflict with the Horde.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
Have you done the deed?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Now, we must follow through and press the advantage.
