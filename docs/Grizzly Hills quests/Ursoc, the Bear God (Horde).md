==Objectives==
[[Windseer Grayhorn]] in [[Conquest Hold]] wants you to find [[Tur Ragepaw]] near [[Ursoc's Den]] and defeat [[Ursoc]] with his help. Use the [[Purified Ashes of Vordrassil]] on Ursoc's Corpse when you've accomplished this. 
* Ursoc Cleansed
* [[Purified Ashes of Vordrassil]] (provided)

==Description==
The time has come, <name>. Now we will learn whether our efforts will accomplish what we need or nothing at all.

Take these ashes and seek the [[furbolg]] that [[Kodian]] told you about, Tur Ragepaw, near Ursoc's Den. You will find the den to the north of [[Grizzlemaw]].

Convince Tur to aid you, for you will need all the help you can get.

Once you've defeated the bear god, use these ashes over his body.

Even if his worldly form is destroyed, his spirit must be saved. 

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{itembox| |Kilt of Deific Torment 	
|Pants of Purified Wind
|Greaves of Sanctified Dissolution 	
|Legguards of Dissolved Hope
|Leggings of Forceful Purification}}

You will also receive:
{{itembox| |Bulwark of the Tormented God}}
and {{cost|17|70}}

==Progress==
You've returned. Did you succeed?

==Completion==
<The druid looks pale and her eyes stare blankly past you. She has left a package in anticipation of your return.>

==Notes==
[[Ursoc's Den]] is in the {{coords|52|23|Grizzly Hills}} area. Talk to {{NPC|Neutral|Tur Ragepaw}}. Ragepaw is a druid, and will shift in to bear, cat, or tree form when you're ready to begin. He will stay in the selected form for the entire fight.
