==Objectives==
Use [[Flamebringer]] to defeat Thane Torvald Eriksson and report to [[Woodsman Drake]] at [[Amberpine Lodge]].
* [[Thane Torvald Eriksson]] slain

==Description==
Now that you've captured the flame-imbued talismans and weakened [[Voldrune]]'s defenses, we can strike at its leader, Thane Torvald Eriksson.

The thane's favorite mount is an unruly [[proto-dragon|proto-drake]] he calls Flamebringer. It is kept bound in chains in the western part of Voldrune, but with the talismans, you should be able to control it long enough to use it against the thane.

Once you have Flamebringer under your control, search the tops of the towers of Voldrune for the thane and show him no mercy. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of these rewards|Headbinder's Crown|Tunic of the Rectified Thane|Legguards of Refuted Feudalism|Skull-Reshaper's Helm|Thane-Reaper's Signet}}
You will also receive: {{cost|5|60}}

==Progress==
Have you overcome the thane? We cannot risk leaving him in power.

==Completion==
Good work, <name>. I doubt any of the woodsmen would've wanted to take a crack at the proto-drake, but we couldn't afford to let the Dragonflayers build a base of power in Grizzly Hills. If only the Horde was so easily dealt with...

==Notes==
[[Flamebringer]] can be found on the southwest side of Voldrune. Simply talk to him to get on. He has three attacks: 
# A long-range (50yd) fireball (no cooldown).
# A short-range buffet ability which knocks the Thane down (circa 8 seconds cooldown).
# A long range Damage over Time fireball (circa 4 seconds cooldown).
Stay relatively close, keep hitting 1, and use 2 and 3 as soon as their cooldowns come up. [[Thane Torvald Eriksson]] has a [[Volley]] attack which hurts  both the [[Proto-Drake]] you are riding and yourself. Two of these are enough to kill you. Get out of the area hit by the volley as soon as you see it being cast.
