==Objectives==
Use Raegar's Explosives to destroy the Runic Power Core at [[Dun Argol]], then report to [[Raegar Breakbrow]] at [[Prospector's Point]].
*[[Dun Argol Power Core]] Destroyed
*[[Raegar's Explosives]] (provided)

==Description==
The large hall at the top of Dun Argol houses the power source for the entire area. If you can destroy the power core, it will cripple Dun Argol for some time.

No power means no golems, no sentries, and no more lightning armaments.

When we were sent up here, they told us these explosives were for excavation, but thanks to [[Iron Thane Furyhammer]], the research has been scrapped. We may as well get some use out of them, though. They're the only thing we have on hand capable of destroying the power core.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|5|90}}

==Progress==
Have you disabled the power source for their runeforges?

==Completion==
<Raegar nods approvingly.>

I can't stand to see explosives go to waste and it'll set our enemies back for sure.

==Notes==
Use the [[Overseer Disguise Kit]] from [[Put on Your Best Face for Loken]] to easily reach the Dun Argol Power Core and Furyhammer for [[The Iron Thane and His Anvil]].
