'''Essence of a Broken Dream''' begins a quest chain that eventually rewards the [[Incandescent Essence]]. To begin, defeat [[Gnarlroot (tactics)|Gnarlroot]] and loot the [[Twisted Dreaming Essence]] from its corpse. Turn in to [[Merithra]], who is located ''inside the raid''.

==Objectives==
Find [[Merithra]] in [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope]], and show her the Twisted Dreaming Essence.
* [[Twisted Dreaming Essence]] (provided)

==Description==
<You feel an echo of ancient sorrow, fear, and rage as you gaze into the swirling depths of this strange sphere. Maybe [[Merithra]] will know more about it?>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27|}}

==Completion==
Interesting... I sense poor [[Gnarlroot (tactics)|Gnarlroot]]'s ancient hopes and dreams within, but darkened and twisted by [[Igira the Cruel|Igira]]'s depraved cruelties. It's as if [[Emerald Dream|the Dream]] itself tried to isolate her efforts in this essence.
