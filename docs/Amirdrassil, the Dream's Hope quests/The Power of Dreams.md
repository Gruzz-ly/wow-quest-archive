'''The Power of Dreams''' is the second step to getting the [[Incandescent Essence]] helm enchant. To begin, loot the [[Twisted Dreaming Essence]] from [[Gnarlroot (tactics)|Gnarlroot]] in [[Amirdrassil, the Dream's Hope]], complete the quest it starts, then spend the next few weeks killing more bosses to collect enough [[Echoed Ephemera]]. This quest is time-gated and the earliest players can complete it is the week of 12 December 2023.

==Objectives==
Gather Echoed Ephemera and the Dreams of the Invaders of Amirdrassil.
* [[Echoed Ephemera]] (50)
* [[Igira's Cruel Nightmare]]
* [[Larodar's Fiery Reverie]]
* [[Smolderon's Delusions of Grandeur]]
* [[Tindral's Fowl Fantasia]]

==Description==
It seems that the fabric of the [[Emerald Dream]] itself is rejecting the invaders, leaving behind shadows of their dreams in the form of these Essences. So close to [[Amirdrassil]], even your own actions are leaving behind ephemeral echoes of power. 

With enough time, perhaps we can use these echoes to awaken their strength and turn it against [[Fyrakk the Blazing|Fyrakk]] himself. Defeat the invaders wherever you find them and return to me when you have gathered enough of the Dream's power.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27|}}

==Progress==
The Dream has many layers, some quite fragile. I worry that even the defenders' presence will change the unchanging land.

==Completion==
This will be sufficient to awaken the dormant power within these fiery essences. Finally, we are ready to turn the invaders' power against them.

==Progression==
#[[Essence of a Broken Dream]]
