==Objectives==
Disperse 75 pieces of filth by killing [[Quivering Filth]] in [[Ihgaluk Crag]].
*Filth dispersed (75)

==Description==
This is not a glamorous job. Let me put it to you bluntly.

The [[Skumblade tribe|Skumblade saurok]] pile all of their filth into a pool in the middle of their village. This filth is so concentrated and so rancid that it has congealed into moving, animate matter.

The saurok can keep their filth-pool, but once it starts spreading outside of the village, I'd say it's time to intervene.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Sorry in advance about the smell.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Looking at you, I'm suddenly quite proud of Dalaran's state-of-the-art plumbing system.

==Notes==
Make sure to complete [[Skin of the Saurok (Alliance)]] for ease of movement in Ihgaluk Crag!

At the crag, head to the filth-pit in the middle and start killing oozes. Even without the disguise, the oozes are neutral and won't attack adventurers indiscriminately.
