==Objectives==
Destroy 6 Zandalari Offerings.
*[[Zandalari Offering]]s destroyed (6)

==Description==
The Zandalari's spiritbinders perform dark sacrifices to appease their gods, killing our people in the process.

Destroy any Zandalari offerings you can find to help slow the pace of their dark sacrifices.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
It seems all of their spiritbinders keep sacrificial offerings nearby. Detestable!

==Completion==
Without the offerings, they will need to collect more before their sacrifices can proceed. Thank you, <class>.

==Notes==
Offerings are within yards of the [[Zandalari Spiritbinder]]s.

==Progression==
{{Kirin Tor Offensive dailies|1}}
