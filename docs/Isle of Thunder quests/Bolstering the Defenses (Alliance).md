==Objectives==
Empower 6 [[Kirin Tor Perimeter Ward]]s around [[Violet Rise]].
*Empower Kirin Tor Perimeter Wards (6)

==Description==
[[Isle of Thunder|This island]] is a dangerous place, <name>. We have to worry about attacks from the [[Zandalari]], mogu, [[Skumblade tribe|saurok]], and worst of all the [[Sunreavers]].

I had perimeter wards placed on the outskirts of our camp for additional protection. In their current state they will only injure an attacker, but I'm done with warnings!

With your help we can super-charge the wards into a more deadly defense system.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Have the perimeter wards been empowered?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. Those perimeter wards should keep out all manner of filth.

With Violet Rise protected we can focus on more pressing matters.

==Notes==
[[Kirin Tor Perimeter Ward]]s are found all over the [[Violet Rise]]. Just interact with them to empower them.

==Progression==
