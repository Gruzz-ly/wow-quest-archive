==Objectives==
Recover a Wild Ptrerrorwing Hatchling.
*[[Wild Pterrorwing Hatchling (item)]]

==Description==
I've just received a report that another young pterrorwing has been spotted in the Diremoor.

We need to recover as many of these as we can find. They may be the key to flying on this island.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
A great gloom looms over this island...

==Completion==
Wonderful! I'll pass him off to our caretaker. Thank you.

==Notes==
There are two hatchlings in the [[Diremoor]]. One flies each path, landing at the points shown below. The eastern pterrorwing flies in a clockwise loop, where the western one flies a more complicated path but lands at the five points counterclockwise. The landing points are numbered starting from the northernmost landing point.
