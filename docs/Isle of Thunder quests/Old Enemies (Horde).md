==Objectives==
Kill 10 Kirin Tor units or players on the [[Isle of Thunder]].
*[[Kirin Tor]] agents slain (10)

==Description==
So the Jaina and the Kirin Tor think they can push us out again? I will not stand by and allow them to repeat the events of Dalaran!

This time we fight back! This time we do the pushing...

Go to [[Violet Rise]] and slay any Kirin Tor agent you find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|h-hp=75|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
How many did you cut down?

==Completion==
So, Violet Rise runs red with the blood of our enemies? Well done, <name>.

This will be an ongoing battle I fear. We must continue to show our strength here.

==Notes==
Eligible mobs are [[Silver Covenant Spellblade]]s and [[Silver Covenant Ranger (Isle of Thunder)|Silver Covenant Rangers]].
