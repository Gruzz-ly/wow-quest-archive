==Objectives==
Stop the Shan'ze Thundercallers' ritual.
*Shan'ze Thundercallers' ritual stopped

==Description==
Within the graveyard, in the deepest ruins of their western crypt, the Thunder King's most powerful sorcerers are charging a lightning rod with crackling electricity.

We suspect that this weapon is meant to rain destruction on our stronghold at [[Dawnseeker Promontory]].

There is no time to delay. You must stop their ritual at once.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Do not allow them to unleash the force of their weapon.

==Completion==
You continue to exceed my expectations, <class>. Well done.

==Notes==
At the northern end of the [[Hall of the Defamed]] at {{co|35|56|Isle of Thunder}} of the [[Court of Bones (Isle of Thunder)|Court of Bones]], four [[Shan'ze Thundercaller]]s are channeling something into a lightning rod. Kill all four of them.
