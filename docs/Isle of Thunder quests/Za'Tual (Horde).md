Find [[Halduron Brightwing]] outside of [[Za'Tual]].

==Description==
The Zandalari have been a constant nuisance since we arrived on this island. I've assigned Hauldron Brightwing to take charge of dismantling their presence at Za'Tual, in the south.

Report to Halduron when you are best able. He will have work for you.

One more to join the Zandalari hunt? Good. Very good.
