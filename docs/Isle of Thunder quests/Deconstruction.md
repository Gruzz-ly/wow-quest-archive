==Objectives==
Destroy 3 Sunreaver Constructs outside of [[Dawnseeker Promontory]].
*[[Sunreaver Construct]] slain (6)

==Description==
[[Scout]]s are reporting a large number of constructs patrolling outside of Dawnseeker Promontory.

If left unchecked they will pose a considerable threat should the [[Sunreavers]] mount an attack.

The only answer is a preemptive strike. We'll destroy them before they can attack us!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Have the constructs been dealt with?

==Completion==
Good work, <class>. As long as we keep the construct numbers in check, we will ensure our success here.
