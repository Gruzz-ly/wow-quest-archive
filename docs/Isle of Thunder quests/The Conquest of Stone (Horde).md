==Objectives==
Stop the Ancient Stone Conqueror ritual in the main temple at the [[Court of Bones (Isle of Thunder)|Court of Bones]].
*Stop the Ancient Stone Conqueror ritual

==Description==
In the Court of Bones, the Thunder King's sorcerers perform dark rituals.

To bolster their numbers, the Shan'ze soulrippers are imbuing ancient stone statues with stolen spirits from the living.

After these stone conquerors are brought to life, they will be formidable opponents on the battlefield.

We must stop their ritual before these statues can be revived.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
It is a mystery how the mogu can imbue life into inanimate stone, but with enough study, we, too, may one day be able to understand that power.

==Completion==
A good defense is just as effective as a strong offense. One less enemy to worry about.

Well done.
