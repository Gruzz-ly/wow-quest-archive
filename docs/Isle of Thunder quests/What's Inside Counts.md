==Objectives==
Destroy Guardian Tak'u in Conqueror's Terrace.
*[[Guardian Tak'u]] slain

==Description==
I noticed something strange on my last scouting mission. A group of Zandalari are performing a ritual on what appears to be a very large sentry. They may be trying to re-animate it.

We need that ritual stopped and the sentry destroyed. Anything that large can't be good.

I've sent a scout ahead to observe their actions. Meet with her and figure out how to stop them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Completion==
So I was correct to be concerned. It's a good thing you were there to stop them before that guardian was fully infused.

Good work, <class>.
