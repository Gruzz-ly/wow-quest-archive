==Description==
This island is riddled with lurking threats from three powerful groups, waiting for the chance to pounce on us. Masters of lightning, ancient and powerful spirits, and primal Zandalari monstrosities.

If you can get your hands on some of the Lei Shen Ritual Stones scattered across the isle, you should be able to beckon these powerful opponents out of hiding and strike out at them.

Find and destroy members of each group to keep them destabilized, and I will make it worth your time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|72|lcgf=5}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan Assault]]

==Progress==
Against these ancient enemies, there is no recourse. We strike first, and they do not strike at all.

==Completion==
Your skills as a <class> are unquestionable. You've aided the cause greatly this day. You have my thanks.

And now for that reward I promised you...

==Notes==
See the [[Shan'ze Ritual Stone]] article for information on summoning the bosses.
