'''The Fall of Shan Bu''' ends the fifth and final stage of the [[Isle of Thunder storyline]], gaining access to the [[Foot of Lei Shen]] and the world boss [[Nalak]]. [[Lor'themar Theron]] will only offer this quest from his position on the [[Dawnseeker Promontory]] once enough realm-wide progress has been made, irrespective of the individual player's standing with the Sunreaver Onslaught.

Much like with the previous progression quest, [[Decisive Action]], this quest mostly takes place in a single-player scenario also called "The Fall of Shan Bu". As the scenario can only be completed once, it is documented here and not in a separate article.

== Objectives ==
Defeat [[Shan Bu]]
*Speak to [[Lor'themar Theron]]
*Capture the [[Foot of Lei Shen]]

== Description ==
Long ago, [[Lei Shen]] found a rare clutch of storm dragon eggs. One of these creatures - [[Nalak]] - was particularly brutal, and Lei Shen took it for his own.

The Thunder King's servant, Shan Bu, works to resurrect Lei Shen's dragon, Nalak.

We must defeat Shan Bu and, if we are able, prevent him from resurrecting the dragon.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
We must defeat Shan Bu while he is exposed!

== Completion ==
Well done, <name>. Shan Bu's fall will weaken the Mogu and your heroism will surely be remembered.

== Notes ==
On approach before accept:
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Champion! Our campaign is reaching a climax: We are at the very threshold of the Thunder King's palace. It is time to knock down his front door.}}
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Speak to me when you are ready to launch the assault!}}
Speak with him again:
:{{gossip|I am ready to launch the assault [Queue for solo instance.]}}

===Stage 1 - Bloodied Crossing===
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 1 - Alliance, Horde, and Shan Bu.jpg|thumb|Alliance, Horde, and Shan Bu]]
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 1 - Taran Zhu and Shan Bu.jpg|thumb|Taran Zhu and Shan Bu]]

:Work with your allies to assault the [[Bloodied Crossing]].
*Speak with your [[Scout Captain Elsia|Assault Leader]] {{co|59.0|43.8|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*Enter the Courtyard
*Zandalari slain x14
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Good, you are here.}}

Step forward and speak with Elsia:
:Are you prepared, <name>?
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Regent Lord! Everyone is in position, and the Shado-Pan are inside, but...}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Yes?}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|The [[Alliance]] is waiting for us just across the courtyard.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Ahhh, so the grand lady of the Kirin Tor wants a fight, does she?}}
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|Rangers! Advance!}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I will deal with Proudmoore.}}
:''The party marches forward as Vereesa opens the gate. The Horde war party is already set up on the opposite side of the Bloodied Crossing. Suddenly, the gate to the Foot of Lei Shen opens!''
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Taran Zhu! It does not matter how many you array against the Thunder King. Soon all will kneel before him.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|YOU will kneel when you beg for my mercy, monster.}}
:''A squad of [[Zandalari Stoneshield]]s jump down from the wall as the gate closes!''
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|One problem at a time, people. Focus on the Zandalari!}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Ignore the Horde - focus on the Zandalari guarding the door!}}

Let the NPCs get initial aggro on the trolls, then do some damage to all of them, even the trolls attacking the Horde war party. Trolls will keep spawning until the champion has credit for killing 14.

===Stage 2 - Destroy the Gatekeepers===
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 2 - Destroy the Gatekeepers.jpg|thumb|Destroy the gatekeepers]]

:Defeat the Palace Gatekeeprs to unlock the gates
*[[Palace Gatekeeper]] slain x2
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Those statues wield the power of the first emperor. Destroy them!}}

Two [[Palace Gatekeeper]]s, level-90 elite [[terracotta warrior]]s with 1.5 million health each, activate with the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Boulder Throw|range=150|Throws a massive boulder.|notes=0.921 sec cast. The missile will trigger...}}
**{{abilities|Boulder Impact|range=150|Throws a massive boulder, dealing 40,500 to 49,500 damage and knocking back any nearby enemies.|notes=Instant. Area of effect marked with a shadow on the ground.}}
*{{abilities|Thundering Slam|range=10|Deals 75,400 to 84,600 Physical damage to all enemies within 15 yards of the impact location.|notes=2.3 sec cast}}
*{{abilities|Crushing Stomp|Crushes nearby enemies, inflicting Physical damage to all enemies in front of the caster.|notes=2.49 sec cast. Hits for ~55K Physical.|cd=8 sec.}}

As before, let the NPCs tank them, but help finish them off.

===Stage 3 - The Foot of Lei Shen===
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 3 - The Foot of Lei Shen.jpg|thumb|The Foot of Lei Shen]]
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 3 - Fending off enemies.jpg|thumb|Fending off enemies]]

:Defeat Shan Bu's Mogu and Zandalari defenders
*Follow Taran Zhu into the courtyard {{co|58.6|39.9|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*Zandalari and Mogu slain x8
:{{text|yell|Scout Captain Elsia|Regent Lord - more Zandalari approach from the mines!}}
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|Damn their hides. Rangers! Hold this position!}}
:''The Alliance war party backtracks to the [[Stormsea Landing]] gate as the Horde war party moves back to defend the [[Thunder Forges]].''
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Taoshi, get those doors open.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Champion, with me. We must press forward while your comrades cover the rear.}}

Move forward and reach Taran Zhu's position:
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Shan Bu! Again you try to create a God. When will you learn?}}
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Who needs a God? We have the Thunder King!}}
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Trolls - make yourselves useful. I am almost finished here.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Zandalari reinforcements are coming.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Yalia - we need more healing! Taoshi - cover the rear!}}
:''Taoshi pulls back as a handful of [[Zandalari Stoneshield]]s, [[Shan'ze Electrocutioner]]s and [[Quilen Guardian (Isle of Thunder)|Quilen Guardians]] draw in to attack.''

Finish them off.

===Final Stage - Defeat Shan Bu===
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 4 - Taran Zhu and Shan Bu.jpg|thumb|Taran Zhu and Shan Bu]]
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 4 - Shan Bu choking Taran Zhu.jpg|thumb|Shan Bu choking Taran Zhu]]

:Assaist Taran Zhu and Yalia in bringing down Shan Bu.
*[[Shan Bu]] slain
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Arise, Nalak! Protect our beloved emperor.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Face me, Shan Bu! Or is the court of the Thunder King a den of cowards?}}
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|The emperor will be most pleased when I present him with your head, Shado-Pan.}}
:{{text|yell|Nalak|I am born of thunder!}}
:''Nalak files up and away as Shan Bu begins his attack.''
Shan Bu is a boss-level mogu with 3,151,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Draw Shadows|Inflicts 75,524 to 83,475 Shadow damage to nearby enemies.|notes=2.76 sec cast. Uninterruptible.}}
*{{abilities|Shadow Crash|range=50|Fires a missle at a random target. When this missile lands, it deals 49,024 to 56,975 Shadow damage to all enemies within 20 yards of that location.|notes=1.84 sec cast. Uninterruptible.|cd=5 sec}}
Shan Bu will also summon two [[Onyx Stormclaw]]s with ~100K health to harry the champion. Additionally, [[Nalak]] will rain down an electrical storm:
*{{abilities|Electrical Storm|Deals 73,537 to 85,463 Nature damage to enemies in the area.|notes=Instant. Area is marked a few seconds beforehand with crackling lightning.}}

Try to stay near Yalia, who has a Divine Renewal aura that will heal for 13-16% of total health every few seconds. That aura will outheal incoming damage from the Shadow Crash and the Electrical Storm. Do take out the summoned Onyx Stormclaws - as they will build up as the fight progresses.

During the fight, Taran Zhu and Shan Bu have a few random yells:
*{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Ours is to rule. Yours is to serve.}}
*{{text|yell|Shan Bu|You are weak. You Shado-Pan scurry through shadows like roaches.}}
*{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Your "Horde" is a disgusting pack of animals, hardly worth enslaving.}}
*{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Your cries of pain delight his majesty!}}
*{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Dance around Shan Bu's attacks. We are faster! We are smarter!}}
*{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Keep moving! Avoid the Stone Lord's lightning!}}
*{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Stay close to Yalia's healing, champion!}}
*{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Stay near Yalia so that she may heal you!}}

At around 15% of total health remaining, Shan Bu stops what he is doing and grabs Taran Zhu in a chokehold:
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|I tire of your insolence! I will choke the life from you, impudent slave!}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Auugh - kill him. Quickly!}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Finish him!}}

Finish Shan Bu off:
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|I ... no... My Emperor! My Emperor, I have failed you!}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|You see? No power of this world can trample the pure of spirit.}}

This completes "The Fall of Shan Bu" portion of [[Isle of Thunder (achievement)]], and thus awards the achievement itself. The scenario keeps going:

:{{text|yell|Taoshi|Lord Zhu! The Alliance - the Horde - all chaos is about to erupt out here!}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Like children.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Taoshi! Hand me my weapon.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|My Lord... you are gravely wounded!}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|My weapon! Champion, with me. I want you to see this.}}
:''Taran Zhu hobbles back to the Bloodied Crossing, where the Alliance and Horde war parties are facing each other down.''
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Hand over the Archmage and I may yet allow you to walk out of here, Lor'themar.}}
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|Proudmoore! You will release my people from the Violet Hold, or I will cut you down myself!}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Your people are legitimate prisoners of war. They orchestrated an attack on Darnassus from MY city-}}
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|The Sunreavers knew NOTHING of Garrosh's raid on Darnassus!}}
:{{text|emote|Aethas Sunreaver shifts uncomfortably.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|ENOUGH!! There will be no more bloodshed today.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|I see now why your Alliance and Horde cannot stop fighting.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Every reprisal is itself an act of aggression, and every act of aggression triggers immediate reprisal.}}
: ''Jaina and Lor'themar shout over each other.''
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|They have undermined EVERY attempt at peace!}}
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|I must protect my sovereign people.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|SILENCE! YOU must break the cycle.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|It ends TODAY. Here. The cycle ends when you, Regent Lord, and you, Lady Proudmoore, turn from one another. And walk. Away.}}
:{{text|emote|Lor'themar narrows his eyes.}}
:{{text|emote|Jaina takes a deep breath.}}
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theorn|Rangers. Lower your weapons.}}
:{{text|yell|Scout Captain Elsia|My Lord!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Very well. We will stand down.}}
:{{text|yell|Vereesa Windrunner|They killed my husband!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmooore|This won't bring him back.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|But know this, "Blood" Elf: There can be no peace while Hellscream is Warchief of the Horde.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|That is precisely why I wish to conserve our strength today.}}
:{{text|emote|Jaina's expression softens.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Lady.}}
:''Lor'themar bows.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Lord.}}
:''Jaina curtsies.''
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|Gather the wounded. Withdraw to the harbor.}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Everyone, regroup back at the camp. Our work here is done.}}
:''The two forces turn and walk away.''
:{{text|yell|Taoshi|Lord Zhu!}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Champion, this cease-fire may not last, but remember what you have seen today.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|We must get you back to the monastery.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Shan Bu's monstrosity remains at the foot of the palace. It must be stopped before it wreaks havoc across Pandaria.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Yalia, take Lord Zhu to safety.}}
:''Yalia mounts up and drapes Taran Zhu sideways across it, before running in the direction of the Diremoor.''
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Hero, it will be up to you to defeat the Storm Lord Nalak. You will have to marshal a small army!}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|But after what I have seen today, I have faith in you.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|It has been a great honor to fight by your side. Thank you.}}

Head back to the [[Stormsea Landing]] gate and interact with the portal to end the scenario. Turn in to Lor'themar back at her usual spot on the [[Dawnseeker Promontory]].
