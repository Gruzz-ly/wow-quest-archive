==Description==
I have three magisters entrenched in [[Ihgaluk Crag]], monitoring the [[saurok]] and - where they can - turning them against the mogu. I need you to find them and see if they need any supplies or assistance.

They will be concealed from view. Look for shimmering columns of light within the saurok village.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Good luck, <name>.

==Completion==
<The Archmage listens carefully to your report.>

I understand. Thank you for your aid, <class>.

==Notes==
Make sure to complete [[Skin of the Saurok (Alliance)]] for ease of movement in [[Ihgaluk Crag]]!

From the northeastern path to the Crag, head in and turn northwest to head up the hill toward the two northernmost marked caves. Magistrix Sanal can be found at roughly {{co|51.7|74.0|Isle of Thunder}} pathing between them. Exit the area and circle around the filth pit counterclockwise. Yalis can be found at {{co|44.5|83.2|Isle of Thunder}} pathing around the southwestern cave marked on the map. Lyanis is at {{co|51.4|85.1|Isle of Thunder}} inside the southernmost marked cave. Step outside of the bubble when the path is clear and wait for the disguise to come back on.
