==Objectives==
Plant a Tactical Mana Bomb on a [[Sunreavers|Sunreaver]] ship, the Scrying Crystals, and on the most inland bridge of [[Dawnseeker Promontory]].
*Bomb placed on Sunreaver Ship
*Bomb placed on Bridge
*Bomb placed on Scrying Crystals
*[[Case of Tactical Mana Bombs]] (provided)

==Description==
Ah, <name>, just the <race> I was looking for. I have received another batch of tactical [[mana bomb]]s that I need planted in key positions across Dawnseeker Promontory to the northwest.

Here, take these. It is time to give the Sunreavers a taste of their own medicine.

Plant one on the Sunreaver ships, another one on their scrying crystals, and the last on the bridge that connects to their forward base.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|a-hp=75|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
I was part of the clean up crew in [[Theramore]]. It is time the [[horde]] learned what their warfare was like.

==Completion==
It pains me to resort to such weaponry, but the Sunreavers must be taught the price of their actions.
