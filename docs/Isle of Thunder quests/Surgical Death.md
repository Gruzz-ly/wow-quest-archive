==Objectives==
Slay 3 Zandalari Spiritbinders, 3 Zandalari Beastcallers, and 3 Zandalari Jaguar Warriors.
*[[Zandalari Beastcaller]] slain (3)
*[[Zandalari Jaguar Warrior]] slain (3)
*[[Zandalari Spiritbinder]] slain (3)

==Description==
The Zandalari train skyscreamers to become ferocious beasts in the skies. The spiritbinders require endless sacrifices - of our people - to be brought to them. And, the jaguar warriors venture ever closer toward the heart of our camp.

Find them in [[Za'Tual]] and remove the threat.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Have you found the trolls you seek?

==Completion==
With a few of their more dangerous kin slain, perhaps the Zandalari will show some reluctance next time they decide to trifle with us.

==Notes==
Look specifically for Zandalar trolls of the specified classes. The three named spiritbinders do count as well.
