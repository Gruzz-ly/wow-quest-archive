==Objectives==
Retrieve the Mask of the Dark Mystic and the Mask of the Spirit-Caller from [[Spiritbinder Tu'chek]] and [[Arcanital Ra'kul]].
*[[Mask of the Spirit-Caller]] {{co|59.4|56.7|Isle of Thunder}}
*[[Mask of the Dark Mystic]] {{co|56.7|46.4|Isle of Thunder}}

==Description==
[[Conqueror's Terrace]] is watched over by two brothers; Spiritbinder Tu'chek and Arcanital Rak'ul. They are powerful magic users and should not be underestimated.

Their power seems to stem from the ornate masks they wear; relics passed down from one generation to the next. Each owner imbuing it with their own magic before passing it on.

We must deal with the brothers and destroy their masks before they fall into the wrong hands.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Where are the masks?

==Completion==
It's a shame, really, that these masks must be destroyed. I would have liked to study this ancient magic, but it is better that they be destroyed than become the tools of the Horde.

Good work, <class>.

==Notes==
The two brothers can be found in the big tents at opposite corners of [[Conqueror's Terrace]]: [[Spiritbinder Tu'chek]] at {{co|59.4|56.7|Isle of Thunder||1}} in the southeast, and [[Arcanital Ra'kul]] at {{co|56.7|46.4|Isle of Thunder||1}} in the northwest.
