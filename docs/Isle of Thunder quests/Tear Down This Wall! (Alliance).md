'''Tear Down This Wall!''' begins the third stage of the [[Isle of Thunder storyline]], by breaching the walls to the [[Beast Pens]] and [[Conqueror's Terrace]] in an attempt to gain access to the [[Lightning Vein Mine]] and the [[Thunder Forges]]. Jaina will only offer this quest from her position on the [[Violet Rise]] once enough realm-wide progress has been made, irrespective of the individual player's standing with the [[Kirin Tor Offensive]].

Much like with the previous progression quest, [[The Assault on Shaol'mara]], this quest mostly takes place in a single-player scenario, also called "Tear Down This Wall!". As the scenario can only be completed once, it is documented here and not in a separate article.

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]], then break into the lower city and secure it for the Alliance.
*Speak to Lady Jaina Proudmoore to begin your mission
*Secure the lower city

==Description==
The time has come. Our forces are well-enough entrenched here that we can risk pressing forward, into the [[Throne of Thunder|Thunder King's lair]]. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like he'll be opening [[Emperor's Gate|that gate]] anytime soon.

I suppose we'll have to make a gate of our own then. Let me know when you're ready, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Let's tear down this wall.

==Completion==
With your help, we're one giant step closer to our goal.

Speak with Jaina again:
:{{gossip|I'm ready to tear down the wall! [Queue for solo instance.]}}
Much like with [[The Assault on Shaol'mara]] to start stage two, this quest plays out in a single-player scenario.

===Intro===
[[File:Tear Down This Wall 0 - Al'chukla charged.jpg|thumb|Al'chukla charged]]

:''The camera tracks along a path reaching the [[Emperor's Gate]], then pans to follow [[War-God Al'chukla]], a Zandalari troll, who walks up the path to [[Lei Shen]]. Al'chukla stops before Lei Shen and kneels.''
:{{text|say|Lei Shen|The unworthy have not yet learned of my power.}}
:{{text|say|Lei Shen|War-God Al'chukla, add my strength to your own.}}
:''Lei Shen casts something into Al'chukla, increasing his size and his power, as sparks of energy start flying from his body.''
:{{text|say|Lei Shen|Make a demonstration of these invaders, such that all nations tremble before me.}}
:{{text|say|War-God Al'chukla|All will fall before us!!}}
:''Al'chukla rises as Lei Shen turns to his right to face [[Shan Bu]]. Shan Bu faces Lei Shen and kneels.''
:{{text|say|Lei Shen|Shan Bu, secure the inner courtyard. None should look upon my works and live.}}
:{{text|say|Shan Bu|As my emperor wills!}}
:''Shan Bu rises to his feet as he shouts and the camera starts tracking back down the path away from the courtyard through the [[Diremoor]].''

===Stage 1: Find Lost Explosives===
[[File:Tear Down This Wall 1 - Find the bomb.jpg|thumb|The bomb cart beset by Zandalari]]
[[File:Tear Down This Wall 1 - Heavy Explosives.jpg|thumb|Heavy Explosives]]

*Acquire the Heavy Explosives {{co|48.4|50.9|Isle of Thunder||1}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|The siege is underway but our heavy explosives never made it to the wall!}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Gather up the explosives and get them to the wall while I rally the reinforcements.}}
Once the cinematic is done, head from the central building in the Diremoor to the northeast and look for the Heavy Bomb. Before getting too far, a [[Zandalari Jaguar Warrior]] and a [[Zandalari Spiritbinder]] will jump the champion. After the ambush, head due north to find the bomb at {{co|48.4|50.9|Isle of Thunder||1}} which has fallen off the back of a cart that was beset (and currently guarded) by four more jaguar warriors.

===Stage 2: Deliver Explosives===
[[File:Tear Down This Wall 2 - Fighting at Emperor's Gate.jpg|thumb|Fighting at Emperor's Gate]]
[[File:Tear Down This Wall 2 - Jaina and Vereesa beneath Conqueror's Terrace.jpg|thumb|Jaina and Vereesa beneath Conqueror's Terrace]]

:''Speak with Vereesa at the city wall.''
*Deliver the Explosives to Vereesa {{co|55.8|57.7|Isle of Thunder||1}}

Jaina and Al'chukla start yelling random lines pretty much instantly:
*{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Don't fall back. Don't give them an inch!}}
*{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Everyone, stay together. Stay focused.}}
*{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Press the attack!}}
*{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Press the attack! We're smarter than they are strong!}}
*{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|The Zandalari are nothing but lap-dogs. Do you hear me? You are pets for the mogu!}}
*{{text|yell|War-God Al'chukla|Turn away, weaklings! Dis be the realm of da Thunder King!}}
*{{text|yell|War-God Al'chukla|Crush them! Bleed them!}}
*{{text|yell|War-God Al'chukla|The spirits give us strength!}}
*{{text|yell|War-God Al'chukla|Break them!}}
*{{text|yell|War-God Al'chukla|Eviscerate them! Our gods will drink their blood!}}

Silver Covenant and Zandalari forces are skirmishing at the [[Emperor's Gate]] and points eastward. The Zandalari should all be engaged, so mount up, try to ignore them, and ride east to Vereesa's position at {{co|55.8|57.7|Isle of Thunder||1}} beneath the [[Conqueror's Terrace]] wall and speak with her:
:The explosives!
:Good work, <name>. Not a moment too soon.
:{{gossip|Here are the explosives, Vereesa.}}

===Stage 3: Detonate Explosives===
[[File:Tear Down This Wall 3 - Vereesa arming the bomb.jpg|thumb|Vereesa arming the bomb.]]
[[File:Tear Down This Wall 3 - Al'chukla escaping.jpg|thumb|Al'chukla escaping.]]

:''Light the fuse on the Heavy Explosives.''
*Detonate the Heavy Explosives {{co|56.3|56.1|Isle of Thunder||1}}
:''Vereesa runs toward the wall and plants the bomb.''
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|The wall is wired up and ready to go - the honor is all yours!}}
Follow Vereesa up to the wall and interact with the heavy explosives.

===Final Stage: Kill War-God Al'chukla===
[[File:Tear Down This Wall 4 - Charging Conqueror's Terrace.jpg|thumb|Charging in Conqueror's Terrace]]
[[File:Tear Down This Wall 4 - Vereesa and Al'chukla.jpg|thumb|Vereesa and Al'chukla facing off]]

*Kill War-God Al'chukla {{co|54.7|45.7|Isle of Thunder||1}}
:{{text|say|War-God Al'chukla|Destroy them, me brothers!}}
:''Al'chukla realizes what's about to happen and jumps off the wall mere seconds before the bomb explodes, opening a massive hole! Vereesa, Jaina and the Kirin Tor Offensive war party rush through.''
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Well done! We're through - pull together, everyone. Press the advantage!}}
:{{text|yell|Vereesa Windrunner|This way! The Zandalari are falling back!}}

Follow Vereesa as she fights a path through three [[Zandalari Bloodguard]]s, one [[Spirit-Bound Sentry]], another bloodguard, another sentry, a [[Zandalari Acolyte]]/[[Zandalari Haruspex]] pull, another sentry, and one last harsupex on the way from the broken wall through the [[Conqueror's Terrace]] to the other side of the [[Emperor's Gate]]. Vereesa stops short of War-God Al'chukla, getting a good look at him for the first time:
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|By the light - what did they DO to that thing?}}

[[War-God Al'chukla]] is a level 90 charged Zandalari troll with 2.7 million health and the following special ability:
*{{abilities|Lightning Pole|range=40|Summon a swirling cloud of lightning that attracks players, dealing damage when they reach the center.|notes=1.84 sec cast. Will suck players in the pole's area of effect toward it. If players get too close, they trigger...}}
**{{abilities|Lightning Pole|Fill an enemy's body with lightning, inflicting 24,512 to 28,488 Nature damage every 0.50 sec for 8 sec.}}

Wind up an attack to start the encounter:
:{{text|yell|War-God Al'chukla|Step forward! Witness the gift of the Thunder King!}}
Al'chukla's only ability outside of basic melee is to summon a '''Lightning Pole''' at a player's feet that will suck the player toward the center of the area of effect and do 25K/0.5sec Nature damage to players if they get too close. Start running the instant he winds up a cast and only stop once the pole's fully formed.

At 75%:
:{{text|yell|War-God Al'chukla|I was chosen. My blood burns with his power!}}

At 25%:
:{{text|yell|War-God Al'chukla|Too much... the spirits cannot contain his might.}}

Finish him off:
:{{text|yell|War-God Al'chukla|You will be punished! Your life a lesson in futility!}}
:{{text|yell|War-God Al'chukla|For Zandalar!!}}

This completes the "Tear Down This Wall!" portion of [[Isle of Thunder (achievement)]], but the scenario continues in the finale.

===Finale===
[[File:Tear Down This Wall 5 - Jaina, Vereesa, and the portal.jpg|thumb|Jaina, Vereesa, and the portal]]

:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Bar the gates! The Zandalari have failed to hold the wall.}}
:''Jaina's party finally catches up to Vereesa and the champion.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|It's dead! You're an inspiration to the Kirin Tor!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Vereesa, are you hurt?}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|It is nothing. I am fine.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You need to get back to camp. I can't lose you.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Gather up the wounded! We've struck a mighty blow today - the next big part of our campaign begins.}}

Use the Portal to the Isle of Thunder created by the Silver Covenant Spellblades to leave the scenario and return to the [[Violet Rise]] to turn in to Jaina.
