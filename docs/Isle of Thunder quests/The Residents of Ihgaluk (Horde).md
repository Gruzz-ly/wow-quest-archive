==Objectives==
Slay a Skumblade Brute, a Skumblade Saur-Priest, and a Skumblade Seadragon.
*[[Skumblade Seadragon]] slain
*[[Skumblade Saur-Priest]] slain
*[[Skumblade Brute]] slain

==Description==
The [[Skumblade tribe|Skumblade]] threaten our people, but responding with all-out slaughter would be an overreaction.

A more reasonable response to their threat would be to slay some of their tribal leaders. There will be less bloodshed, and they will still respect our perimeter.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
The saurok value strength above all else. They only respond to strength.

Peace with the saurok will require some amount of bloodshed. The question is, how much?

==Completion==
I know the true price of bloodshed. I know the cost of war.

It would be simpler to blindly massacre our attackers until they yield. But is it right?
