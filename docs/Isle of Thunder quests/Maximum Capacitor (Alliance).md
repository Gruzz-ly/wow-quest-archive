==Objectives==
Destroy the 3 [[Lightning Drill|lightning drills]] in the [[Lightning Vein Mine]], and kill Metal Lord Mono-Han.
*Western Lightning Drill destroyed {{co|20.8|69.3|Lightning Vein Mine}} / {{co|47.9|30.5|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*Central Lightning Drill destroyed {{co|31.9|37.7|Lightning Vein Mine}} / {{co|49.2|26.8|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*Eastern Lightning Drill destroyed {{co|61.7|15.0|Lightning Vein Mine}} / {{co|52.7|24.2|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*[[Metal Lord Mono-Han]] slain

==Description==
The mines [[Beast Pens|north of here]] are critical to the mogu supply line. They are using giant lightning enchanted drills to extract the ore.

If you can disrupt the drills, they'll be destroyed, greatly slowing their ability to make weapons.

Oh, also, kill whoever is in charge, will you?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 XP
* +100 reputation with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Completion==
Time to push ahead - to the forge!

==Notes==
Enter the [[Lightning Vein Mine]] at {{co|49|33|Isle of Thunder||1}} from the northwestern corner of the [[Beast Pens]] and turn left to find the Western Lightning Drill guarded by two [[Shan'ze Electromancer]]s. Take them out and interact with the drill to destroy it. Take the southern fork, heading east, then turn left to the north to head under the northern path to reach the pool, where thecentral drill can be found. Keep heading northeast to reach the northernmost extent of the mine to find the eastern drill. Kill a path to the eastern exit to reach the [[Thunder Forges]].

[[Metal Lord Mono-Han]] is pathing up and down the path on the lower level. See his article for abilities and tactics. On Mono-Han's death, the quest completes automatically.
