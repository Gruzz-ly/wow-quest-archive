==Objectives==
Kill 9 Kirin Tor Manafiends.
*[[Kirin Tor Manafiend]] slain (9)

==Description==
Manafiends are nasty creatures. Small and easy to underestimate, but deadly to our magic casters. The Kirin Tor have these pests crawling all over [[Violet Rise]].

We will need to handle them carefully. Alone they are easily managed, but in groups they become a different challenge altogether.

Go to Violet Rise and cut down their numbers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|h-hp=75|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Terrible little creatures aren't they?

==Completion==
This task will be ongoing, but you have done as a great service, <race>.
