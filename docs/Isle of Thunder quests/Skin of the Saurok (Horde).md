==Objectives==
Go to [[Ihgaluk Crag]] and slay a [[Skumblade tribe|Skumblade saurok]].
*Skumblade saurok slain

==Description==
Ihgaluk Crag is a dangerous place. Luckily, you have the magic of the Sunreavers behind you.

I can transform you into a saurok.

I will perform the first half of the illusion on you now. Afterwards, you should go directly to Ihgaluk Crag and slay one of the Skumblade saurok. Once you have done this, I will contact you and complete the second half of the illusion.

==Completion==
<The voice of Magistrix Saia echoes in your mind.>

Is it done yet? Ah, good.

I can complete the second half of the enchantment now. You will soon see your disguise appear. As long as you stay out of combat, the saurok should see you as one of their own.

Good luck!
