==Objectives==
Steal the Workshop Orders and slay the new captain of the Zandalari warship.
*Warship Captain slain
*[[Workshop Orders]]

==Description==
The [[Zandalari troll|Zandalari]] have already begun repairing that [[warship]], but we can keep it crippled with minimal effort.

Simply relieve the new captain of his post, and steal the ship's damage report from that workshop just outside the vault.

No captain. No repairs. No warship.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 XP
*+150 reputation with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
[[Lei Shen]] will fall to our onslaught, and my people will find glory in his ruin.

==Completion==
This so-called "Thunder King" is surrounded and cut off from his allies. No tyrant is strong enough to stand alone.

Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. Take this, with my thanks.

==Notes==
*Kill either [[Arcweaver Uzan]] or [[Beastcaller Tuk'wa]].
