==Objectives==
Steal the Workshop Orders and slay the new captain of the Zandalari warship.
*Warship Captain slain
*[[Workshop Orders]] {{co|63.8|38.8|Isle of Thunder||1}}

==Description==
The [[Zandalari Empire|Zandalari]] have already begun repairing that [[warship]], but we can keep it crippled with minimal effort.

Simply relieve the new captain of his post, and steal the ship's damage report from that workshop just outside the vault.

No captain. No repairs. No warship.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|45|60|lcgf=2}}
*471000 [[XP]]
*+400 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Each passing hour brings us closer to breaking the Thunder King.

==Completion==
Casualties are down significantly with that warship out of commission, and we continue to press the siege on [[Lei Shen]].

Fantastic work out there today, hero.

Please, take this - you have earned it.

==Notes==
Head down the hill into the [[Stormsea Landing]] and follow the edge of the building to the northeast. Just past the entrance to the [[Swollen Vault]] near the [[Smoldering Anvil]] are the [[Workshop Orders]] sitting on a table.

Down at the dock, hopefully, is the Zandalari warship. Either [[Beastcaller Tuk'wa]] or [[Arcweaver Uzan]] will be on deck.
