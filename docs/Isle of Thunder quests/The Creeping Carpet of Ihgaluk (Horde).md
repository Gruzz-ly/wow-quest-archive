==Objectives==
Crush 150 Ihgaluk Roaches.
*[[Ihgaluk Roach]] crushed (150)

==Description==
Ah, roaches! I once [[Jeremiah Payson|bought]] a pet roach in the [[Undercity]].

Roaches will soak up disease like a sponge, and then spread it as far as they can run. Which is pretty far.

Ihgaluk Crag is crawling with the things, and they carry Skumblade filth all over of this island. Crush as many of them as you can while you're there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
This should be fairly simple. Just smush them.

==Completion==
Every little bit helps.
