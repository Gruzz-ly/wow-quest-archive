==Objectives==
Slay 10 [[Skumblade tribe|Skumblade saurok]].
*Skumblade saurok slain (10)

==Description==
[[Ihgaluk Crag]] has no end of [[saurok]]. Those beasts attack my men and spread their disease into nearby water and wildlife, interfering with our operations.

Thin their numbers, <name>. Once the [[Alliance]] takes full control of [[Isle of Thunder|this island]], we can look for more permanent solutions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Our tacticians seem to think there is some value in the saurok's presence. I am starting to strongly question these views.

==Completion==
One day, this island will belong to the Alliance. I can only hope that it will be free of saurok before then.

<Modera sneers.>

At least they attack the Horde, too.

==Notes==
Make sure to complete [[Skin of the Saurok (Alliance)]] for ease of movement in Ihgaluk Crag!

Any saurok unit in [[Ihgaluk Crag]] counts, even the named.
