==Objectives==
Destroy 8 Grave Guardians.
*[[Grave Guardian]]s destroyed (8)

==Description==
Our assault on the [[Court of Bones (Isle of Thunder)|Court of Bones]] continues. Our progress remains slow, but measurable.

Unfortunately, we've received several reports of stone [[quilen]] statues coming to life without warning. These quilen are too dangerous to ignore.

Venture into the Court of Bones and destroy any quilen statues that you can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Although the stone quilen are dangerous, I may still be able to glean knowledge from their shattered pieces.

==Completion==
I am glad to hear that you left the quilen in a thousand tiny pieces. They are little more than a nuisance to my work here on the island.

==Notes==
[[Quilen]] statues can be found all over the court of bones. Much like with the [[Mogu Statue]]s in the [[Ruins of Guo-Lai]] for [[No Stone Unturned (quest)]], they can be interacted with. Most of the time they will instantly shatter, awarding quest credit, but they may activate and turn hostile. They have a standard amount of health for a level 90 mob and no special abilities.

==Progression==
