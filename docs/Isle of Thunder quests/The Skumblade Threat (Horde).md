==Objectives==
Slay 10 Skumblade saurok.
*Skumblade saurok slain (10)

==Description==
[[Ihgaluk Crag]] has no end of [[saurok]]. Those beasts attack my men and spread their disease into nearby water and wildlife, interfering with our operations.

Thin their numbers, <name>. Once the [[Horde]] takes full control of this island, we can look for more permanent solutions.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
If [[Sunwalker Dezco|Dezco]] weren't literally standing right there, I might ask you to murder the whole lot of them.

<[[Aethas Sunreaver|Aethas]] looks distastefully in the direction of Ihgaluk Crag.>

==Completion==
One day, this island will belong to the Horde. I can only hope that it will be free of saurok before then.

<Aethas sneers.>

At least they attack the [[Alliance]], too.
