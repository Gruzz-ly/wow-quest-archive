==Objectives==
Kill 5 Spirit-Bound Sentries and then use the Resonance Crystal to capture the Zandalari Spirits trapped within.
*Zandalari Spirits captured (5)
*[[Resonance Siphon]] (provided)

==Description==
The Zandalari do not tolerate weakness in their ranks, <class>.

Those that are deemed weak are often sacrificed in barbaric ceremonies. The victims' spirits are captured and entombed within the sentries you see guarding the grounds.

I wish to study their essence. For this I will need your help.

Take this resonance crystal and siphon the spirits from the sentry corpses.

Do not allow them to escape!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Have you completed your task, <class>?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <class>! This will aid my studies greatly, as well as advance our cause here.
