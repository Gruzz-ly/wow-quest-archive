==Objectives==
[[File:Gura the Reclaimed mob.jpg|thumb|[[Gura the Reclaimed]].]]

Use the Incantation of Gura in the [[Hall of the Exalted]], then defeat Gura the Reclaimed.
*[[Gura the Reclaimed]] slain {{co|36.8|56.4|Isle of Thunder}}
*[[Incantation of Gura]] (provided)

==Description==
Every day, we uncover additional relics from the [[Court of Bones (Isle of Thunder)|Court of Bones]].

Recently, we discovered this scroll amongst the gravestones in one of the deepest crypts.

I believe that this incantation can be used to call beyond the grave. And if my Mogu is up to date, I'd say you should use it in the last room in the Hall of the Exalted.

Would you be willing to test out my theory?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 XP
* +150 reputation with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
How did it go?

==Completion==
Ah yes, you've just confirmed my theory! Thank you, <class>.

==Notes==
Head into the eastern crypt of the [[Court of Bones (Isle of Thunder)|Court of Bones]] and circle around the locked door to the north end of the crypt to find Gura the Reclaimed's tomb marker.

See [[Gura the Reclaimed]]'s article for abilities and tactics.
