==Objectives==
Rescue the three captured Sunreaver agents within the [[Lightning Vein Mine]], and kill Metal Lord Mono-Han.
*[[Scout Elearis]] rescued
*[[Scout Merior]] rescued
*[[Scout Alaine]] rescued
*[[Metal Lord Mono-Han]] slain
*[[Arcane Emancipator]] (provided)

==Description==
The heavy mogu presence in the mines let us know it was a place of great importance - but we needed to gather more information on their activities there, so we sent agents into the mines to spy on them. Unfortunately, many were captured, and we've found that some are being tortured in the mines. You have to go rescue them - nobody deserves what they are going through... And, when you finish, kill whoever captured them. No mercy, <name>!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 XP
* +150 reputation with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Notes==
Enter the [[Lightning Vein Mine]] at {{co|49|33|Isle of Thunder}} from the northwestern corner of the [[Beast Pens]] and look to the right to find Scout Elearis hanging from a statue. Get within 15 yards of him, and while not in combat, use the item with Reginald targeted. It's got roughly a 5-second channel. When the channel is complete, Reginald will be teleported out. Take the southernmost fork, on the right, and head east to find Merior hanging from a ceiling on the lower level. Repeat the process, then keep moving eastward to reach the main cave. Turn left, facing west, to find Alaine, hanging from the ceiling as well. Free him, then exit the mines at its easternmost entrance to reach the [[Thunder Forges]].

[[Metal Lord Mono-Han]] is pathing up and down the path on the lower level. See his article for abilities and tactics. On Mono-Han's death, the quest completes automatically.
