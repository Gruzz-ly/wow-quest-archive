==Objectives==
Retrieve 6 Ritual Artifacts from around [[Conqueror's Terrace]].
*[[Ritual Artifact]] (6)

==Description==
This whole area is littered with [[Zandalari]] artifacts. I would be lying if I said studying them didn't interest me. I am fascinated by the significance of these objects to their rituals.

The more we understand our enemies, the better prepared we are to defeat them.

If I am to study them, I will need to see them up close. Bring me as many artifacts as you can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
What have you brought me, <class>?

==Completion==
These are excellent finds! Studying them will take time, but there is much to be gained in understanding the Zandalari. 

==Notes==
Ritual artifacts are found hanging from trees, bigger buildings, and upon many tables in the [[Conqueror's Terrace]].

==Progression==
