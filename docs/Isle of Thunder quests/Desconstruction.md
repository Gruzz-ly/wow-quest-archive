==Objectives==
Destroy 3 Kirin Tor Constructs around [[Violet Rise]].
*[[Kirin Tor Construct]] slain (3)

==Description==
The Kirin Tor constructs are primitive at best. Nevertheless, they pose a threat.

Go to Violet Rise and dismantle Jaina's pitiful war machines. Show the Kirin Tor how easily they can be defeated!

This will be a message the Kirin Tor cannot easily ignore.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Do the constructs still stand?

==Completion==
So the constructs have fallen? Good!

We will remind Jaina and the Kirin Tor at every turn that the Sunreavers are not to be taken lightly.
