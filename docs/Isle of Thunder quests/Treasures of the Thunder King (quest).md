Taoshi will only offer this quest after acquiring a [[Key to the Palace of Lei Shen]].

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Taoshi]] to enter the [[Troves of the Thunder King|Thunder King's Citadel]]. Inside, provide her with a [[Key to the Palace of Lei Shen]] to begin the timed raid on his treasure convoy.
*Speak to Taoshi in [[Bleak Hollow]] {{co|51.4|46.2|Isle of Thunder}}
*Raid the Thunder King's Citadel {{coords|35.9|79.8|Troves of the Thunder King}}

==Description==
My scouts have returned with word that more of the treasures from Lei Shen's tomb are being brought up into the citadel. We have access to a secret sewer entrance, but a door bars us from intercepting the shipment. If we're going to succeed in this raid, we will need a key that only the most trusted of Lei Shen's forces carry.

If you get your hands on such a key, bring it to me.

You can keep whatever spoils you steal from our raid. I simply want to see that this shipment never makes it to Lei Shen.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|24|72}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan Assault]]
*[[Burial Trove Key]]

==Progress==
We must disrupt Lei Shen in any way we can. Anything to hinder the rise of his power. Anything to hinder his armies from being bolstered.

If that means highway robbery, I can live with that.

==Completion==
Not entirely unsuccessful. Still, we'll do better next time.

Thanks for providing us with that key. The raid would not have gone off without you.

==Notes==
Get to the [[Bleak Hollow]] to pick up this quest, then speak with her again.

:We are ready to launch the raid at a moment's notice. All we need is the key. Have you found one?
{{gossip|I have the key, let's start the raid. [Queue for solo instance.]}}

Choosing Taoshi's gossip option will queue the adventurer for the [[Troves of the Thunder King]] scenario. See that article for tactics and a walkthrough.
