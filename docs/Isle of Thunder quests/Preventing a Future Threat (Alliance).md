==Objectives==
[[File:Hatchling Skyscreamer.jpg|thumb|[[Hatchling Skyscreamer]].]]
Frighten 12 Hatchling Skyscreamers by running near them.
*[[Hatchling Skyscreamer]]s frightened (12) {{co|28|80|Isle of Thunder}}

==Description==
It pains me to think of the torture the poor [[skyscreamer]]s must endure as the trolls train them to become implements of war.

The hatchlings are quite fearful, and will fly away if you even get close them. Please, frighten some away before the Zandalari corrupt them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Have you frightened the hatchlings off?

==Completion==
Welcome back, <race>. The hatchlings you frightened will live a better life without their captors.

==Notes==
On the southwestern beach of [[Za'Tual]], plenty of friendly Hatchling Skyscreamers are being tended to by [[Zandalari Beastcaller]]s. Run near to the skyscreamers to scare them off and fend off the beastcallers. Be sure to keep an eye out for a rare blue skyscreamer and scare it off to earn the achievement [[Blue Response]].
