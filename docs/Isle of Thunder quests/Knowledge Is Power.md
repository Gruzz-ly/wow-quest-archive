==Objectives==
Retrieve 6 Ritual Artifacts from around [[Conqueror's Terrace]].
*[[Ritual Artifact]] (6)

==Description==
The Zandalari here practice a different kind of magic. We must understand it before we can defeat it, <class>.

Their control over the arcane and shadow is impressive. I wish to learn how they have achieved what so many others have not.

I believe their ritual artifacts may hold the answers I seek. Bring me a sampling of the artifacts you find, and I will ensure you are rewarded properly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Did you find the artifacts?

==Completion==
These will do nicely, <class>. Excellent work.

==Progression==
