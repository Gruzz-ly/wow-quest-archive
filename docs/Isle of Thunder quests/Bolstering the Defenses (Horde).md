==Objectives==
Empower 6 Sunreaver Perimeter Wards.
*Empower [[Sunreaver Perimeter Ward]]s (6)

==Description==
This island holds many dangers for us. Threats loom from every side. We must defend our hold on these shores at all costs.

Perimeter wards have been placed around [[Dawnseeker Promontory]]. By default they will inflict damage, but are not fatal in their attack.

Now is not the time to be merciful, <race>. The perimeter wards need to be deadly!

Go and empower the perimeter wards surrounding our camp.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Is the perimeter protected?

==Completion==
Now that the wards have been fully armed, we can focus our attention elsewhere. Nothing will be slipping past us now!
