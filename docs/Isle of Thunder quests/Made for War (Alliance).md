==Objectives==
Kill the Pyrestar Demolisher.
*[[Pyrestar Demolisher]] slain {{co|34.9|38.1|Isle of Thunder}}

==Description==
Some things are built with multiple purposes in mind. Some things are built with the sole purpose of destruction.

A massive construct called the Pyrestar Demolisher sits guarding [[Dawnseeker Promontory]]. Its purpose is solely to destroy. It must be dismantled.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|a-hp=75|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
What of the Pyrestar Demolisher?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <race>. The problem with constructs is they can always be rebuilt.

I imagine it will not take the Sunreavers long to build a new death machine.

==Notes==
At {{co|34.9|38.1|Isle of Thunder||1}} on the bridge between the mainland and the [[Dawnseeker Promontory]] island is the [[Pyrestar Demolisher]]. A level-90 [[arcane golem]] with 2.7 million health, see its article for abilities and tactics to defeat it.
