==Objectives==
Kill any 8 [[Zandalar tribe|Zandalari trolls]] within [[Conqueror's Terrace]].
*Conqueror's Terrace Zandalari slain (8)

==Description==
The Zandalari here are a threat to our campaign, <class>.

Their use of magic is an abomination. They mix the power of arcane with the darkness of shadow with little care to consequence.

We cannot afford for them to find their full strength here or for the Horde to learn of their twisted magic.

Their numbers must be thinned. I will leave this task to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Have the casters been dealt with?

==Completion==
Well done, <class>. The more Zandalari we destroy, the less chance their magic will fall into Horde hands.

==Notes==
Any troll counts except for [[Arcanital Ra'kul]] and [[Spiritbinder Tu'chek]].
