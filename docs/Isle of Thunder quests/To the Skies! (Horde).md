== Objectives ==
Gain access to the [[Lightning Vein Mine]].
* Speak to [[Lor'themar Theron]] to begin your mission
* Assault the Lightning Vein Mines

== Description ==
We can use the [[pterrorwing]] that you found to strike a decisive blow against the [[mogu]]. Their mining operation is vulnerable to attack from the air, and your pterrorwing is the only beast we have capable of flying out there. Let me know when you are ready!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

== Progress ==
It's time to begin your mission!

== Completion ==
Incredible work. This presents us with a monumental opportunity.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|With the help of the Shado-Pan and this beast you recovered, I believe we can infiltrate and disable the Thunder King's armory.}}
Speak with him again:
:{{gossip|I am ready! [Queue for solo instance.]}}
This will queue the adventurer for the "To the Skies!" single-player scenario.

===Stage 1 - Taking Off===
[[File:Thunderwing Horde.jpg|thumb|Thunderwing]]

:''Mount your Thunderwing!''
*Mount Thunderwing {{co|32.22|34.36|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*Approach the Mine Entrance {{co|49|30|Isle of Thunder||1}}
Head south a few yards to approach the [[Thunderwing]]<!-- Thunderwing / 90 Pterrorwing Beast / Horde / 70208 Dawnseeker Promontory / 787,000 / Alive -->, and Elsia.
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Elsia is waiting for you, champion.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|This creature you've recovered is immune to the lightning strikes that protect the island.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Do you think you can ride it?}}
Hop on:
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Very good!  Once you take to the skies, the Zandalari will try to stop you.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Be ready to dogfight in the air. Jump from mount to mount if you have to!}}
:''The thunderwing takes off.''
:{{text|yell|Scout Captain Elsia|A Shado-Pan contact will be waiting to meet you behind the mines. Good luck!!}}
The pterrorwing will fly westward through the [[Diremoor]] then turn northward to start circling clockwise around the [[Lightning Vein Mine]] and the [[Thunder Forges]].

===Stage 2 - Intercepted===
[[File:To the Skies 2 - Ambush.jpg|thumb|Intercepted by Zandalari Beastcallers!]]

:''The Zandalari have spotted you! Defeat your attackers!''
*Defeat your Attackers! {{co|49.2|25.6|Isle of Thunder||1}}

[[Zandalari Beastcaller]]s fly up behind the adventurer and will start attacking it with throwing axes. Classes with ranged abilities may stay on their own mount, but the skyscreamers will occasionally get out of range of each other. It will thus likely be easier to '''Jump!''' with the bonus action button to the mount of the targeted beastcaller. While circling the mine, the champion is buffed with '''Thunderous Innervation''': "Killing enemies heals you for 30,000 every 1 sec for 5 sec."

One beastcaller will spawn, then two, then finally three. Take them all out. The skyscreamer will circle around before reaching the northwestern mine entrance, where [[Beastmaster Horaki]] will shoot the player off its mount!
:{{text|yell|Beastmaster Horaki|FOOLS! I will show you how it is done!}}

===Stage 3 - Master the Beastmaster===
[[File:To the Skies 3 - Beastmaster Horaki.jpg|thumb|Beastmaster Horaki]]

:''Horaki has knocked you from your mount! Defeat him!''
*Horaki defeated {{co|47.8|25.6|Isle of Thunder||1}}
:{{text|yell|Beastmaster Horaki|Did ya think ya could just fly ova' hea' unnoticed?!}}
:{{text|yell|Beastmaster Horaki|Well, ya got where you were goin'. Too bad you're not gonna live long enough to see it!}}
:{{text|yell|Beastmaster Horaki|Prepare to die, intrudah!}}

[[Beastmaster Horaki]] is a level-90 elite Zandalar troll with nearly three million health. See his article for a full strategy, but get out of the Frost Shot area of effect before he launches the Hail of Arrows. The hails will last for the rest of the encounter, so get just outside of the arrows' area of effect (marked by a red circle) to not waste space.

Finish him off to start the next stage.

===Stage 4 - Into the Mines===
[[File:To the Skies 4 - Meet up with Taoshi.jpg|thumb|Meeting up with Taoshi]]

:''Meet up with Taoshi, your Shado-Pan Contact.''
*Joined with Taoshi {{co|49.3|26.0|Isle of Thunder||1}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Well now. You sure know how to arrive in style.}}

Taoshi is standing by the cave-in. Speak with her:
:I will destroy this cave in, and then we can sneak in from behind. Let me know when you are ready.
:{{gossip|Alright. Let's go.}}

===Stage 5 - What's Yours is Mine===
[[File:To the Skies 5 - Blowing up the cave in.jpg|thumb|Blowing up the cave in]]

:''Make your way to the mine's main door.''
*Cave-in cleared {{co|49.5|25.5|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*Make Your Way to the Mine Entrance {{co|32.3|57.7|Lightning Vein Mine}} / {{co|49.2|29.1|Isle of Thunder||1}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Let's get down to business.}}
:''Taoshi runs up to the cave-in, drops a bomb, and then takes cover behind the adventurer.''

Head into the freshly-opened mine and start killing a path to the southwest through [[Shan'ze Electrocutioner]]s, [[Shan'ze Slaver]]s, and [[Saurok Slave]]s to reach the southern entrance. During this time, Taoshi will chime in randomly:
*{{text|say|Taoshi|I have seen many things. But the cruelty of the mogu still curdles my blood.}}
*{{text|say|Taoshi|Slaves - everywhere slaves. You can see what we fight against.}}
*{{text|say|Taoshi|We are in the heart of the mogu war machine.}}
*{{text|say|Taoshi|The Shado-Pan strike from the shadows, so that our enemies fear the dark.}}
*{{text|say|Taoshi|The mogu forge weapons of both blood and steel. Their blades feast on death.}}
*{{text|say|Taoshi|I have trained my entire life for this.}}
*{{text|say|Taoshi|I prefer a swift, silent kill. But your methods have their advantages.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|They will learn that no place is safe from the Shado-Pan.}}

===Final Stage - Cover Me===
[[File:To the Skies 6 - Taoshi and Shiaxu.jpg|thumb|Taoshi and Shiaxu]]
[[File:Slavemaster Shiaxu.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Slavemaster Shiaxu}}]]

:''Cover Taoshi while she deactivates the lock on the mine door, and defeat Slavedriver Shiaxu.''
*Shiaxu Defeated {{co|27.9|66.5|Lightning Vein Mine}} / {{co|48.7|30.2|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*Mine door unlocked
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Step lightly! We are almost to the gate.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|There - the slave master! Hold his attention while I undo the lock.}}
:{{text|yell|Slavemaster Shiaxu|What is this? Another uprising?}}
:''Taoshi drops what she's doing and runs to the southern door.''

[[Slavemaster Shiaxu]] is a level-90-elite mogu with 2 million health. See his article for abilities and full tactics. In short, get out of the '''Capture''' area of effect, as he will '''Deadly Kick''' the same area on his next attack, and get at least 40 yards away from the shackles to break the '''Chains'''.

Finish him off:
:{{text|yell|Slavemaster Shiaxu|You will be... punished...}}
:{{text|yell|Taoshi|I have it! The gates are undone!}}

This completes the "Take the Forge" portion of [[Isle of Thunder (achievement)]] as the scenario concludes.

===Finale===
[[File:To the Skies 6 - Horde finale.jpg|thumb|Wrapping up with Lor'themar]]

:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|Rangers! Secure the forge. Smash the gate, so it cannot be closed!}}
:''[[Sunreaver Ranger]]s charge in and clear the mine of mogu.''
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Incredible work. I knew the Shado-Pan would make excellent allies.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|We share a common enemy, Regent Lord, nothing more.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Regardless, we have delivered a terrible blow to the Thunder King today. Horde metalsmiths can begin studying mogu fabrication techniques immediately.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|With all respect - these abominable tools should be destroyed!}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|In good time, my pandaren friend. In good time.}}
Use the portal behind Lor'themar to return to Dawnseeker Promontory.
