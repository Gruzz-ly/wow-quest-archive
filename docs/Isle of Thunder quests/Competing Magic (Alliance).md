;Started by Lan'dalock, Modera, Narasi
:You're dependable, <name>. I like that.

;Jaina
:Your skills are impressive indeed. Thank you for doing this for me, <name>.

==Notes==
The least painful way to get to [[Arcweaver Jor'guva]]'s position from the ship is to cut through [[Ihgaluk Crag]] with the [[Skin of the Saurok (Alliance)]] buff. Jor'guva is situated at {{co|44.0|69.0|Isle of Thunder}} immediately northwest of Ihgaluk Crag,  between the crag, [[Za'Tual]], and the [[Diremoor]]. See his article for abilities and tactics.
