==Objectives==
Frighten 12 Hatchling Skyscreamers by running near them.
*[[Hatchling Skyscreamer]]s frightened (12)

==Description==
The creatures the Zandalari ride don't start out so big, nor do they start out the vicious and loyal creatures they become. If you can frighten some of the hatchling skyscreamers away from the beach, perhaps they will have a chance at a real life.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Were you able to frighten off the hatchlings?

==Completion==
You have returned, <race>. It is my hope that these young [[skyscreamer]]s have the lives they deserve without dealing with the harsh treatment of the trolls.
