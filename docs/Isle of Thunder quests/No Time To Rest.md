==Objectives==
Locate [[Scout Captain Daelin]] within [[Conqueror's Terrace]].

==Description==
We have accomplished much since arriving here, but now is not the time to rest. Your efforts have helped us breach the upper level of the [[Lei Shen|Thunder King's]] stronghold.

Now, I call on you to continue our campaign. Report to Scout Captain Daelin within Conqueror's Terrace. He will have further orders for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|96}}
*59000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The Zandalari here are not to be under-estimated, <class>. Powerful magic overwhelms this space.

We must be diligent in our efforts.

==Notes==
Exit the rise heading northwest to the mainland, then take the fork heading northeast to circle around counterclockwise to reach the east side of [[Conqueror's Terrace]]. Daelin and [[Miura Brightweaver]] are hiding in a shield, much like the ones used on [[Ihgaluk Crag]].
