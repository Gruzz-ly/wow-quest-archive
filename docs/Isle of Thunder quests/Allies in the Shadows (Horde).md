== Objectives ==
Speak to [[Taran Zhu]] in [[Bleak Hollow]].

== Description ==
The [[Shado-Pan]] arrived here before we did, and they are already at work undermining the [[Lei Shen|Thunder King]]'s forces.

I want to you meet with Taran Zhu, the leader of the Shado-Pan, and offer your services on behalf of the [[Sunreavers]]. I doubt he is truly in need of the aid, but the gesture holds importance in itself.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 [[XP]]

== Completion ==
Welcome, <name>.

== Notes ==
Use the teleporter on deck to reach [[Court of Bones]] and cut through the [[Zandalari troll]]-infested territory. Follow the road to reach [[The Emperor's Gate]].

Immediately west (to the left) of the gate is a cave, the [[Bleak Hollow]], which the [[Shado-Pan]] has claimed as their base.

Taran Zhu's followup quest, [[Secrets in the Isle of Thunder]], is not part of the main progression, but it is something to do while otherwise questing.

==Progression==
{{Sunreaver Onslaught progression|1}}

== Patch changes ==
* {{Patch 5.2.0|note=Added.}}
