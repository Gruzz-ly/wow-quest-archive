Retrieve the Mask of the Dark Mystic and the Mask of the Spirit-Caller from [[Spiritbinder Tu'chek]] and [[Arcanital Ra'kul]] within [[Conqueror's Terrace]].
*[[Mask of the Spirit-Caller]]
*[[Mask of the Dark Mystic]]

==Description==
The Zandalari have found a way to infuse items of great power with the essence of their loa. These items are often passed from one generation to another, each recipient adding to the item's power.

Two such items exist here. To be specific, two masks, worn by two brothers.

Spiritbinder Tu'chek and Arcanital Ra'kul must be stopped and their masks destroyed.

Kill them and return their masks to me. I will make sure the masks are disposed of.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Do you have the masks?

==Completion==
Getting these masks was no easy task, <class>. I am grateful for your service.
