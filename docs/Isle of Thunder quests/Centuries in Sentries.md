==Objectives==
Kill 5 [[Spirit-Bound Sentry|Spirit-Bound Sentries]] and then use the Resonance Crystal to capture the Zandalari spirits trapped within.
*Zandalari Spirits captured (5)
*[[Resonance Siphon]] (provided)

==Description==
Sacrifices are common place in Zandalari society. There is however one oddity among these barbaric rituals; volunteers. They treat it as a great honor!

The weak still seek to contribute, even if that means giving their lives to be bound to the sentries you see walking around. Locked away in service to their people.

Take this resonating crystal. Once destroyed, drain the sentry of its Zandalari inhabitant. Return the crystal to me when your task is complete.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 XP
* +150 reputation with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
How many spirits have you captured?

==Completion==
This is very interesting, <class>. The crystal hums with the rage of its captive inhabitants. Even after the passage of time their devotion has not decreased.

I will need to study this further.

==Notes==
Find and kill a [[Spirit-Bound Sentry]], target it, then use the [[Resonance Siphon]] to extract the soul from its corpse.
