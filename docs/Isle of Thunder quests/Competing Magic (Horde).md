==Objectives==
Kill Arcweaver Jor'guva.
*[[Arcweaver Jor'guva]] slain

==Description==
My scouts have spotted a dangerous Zandalari just this side of [[Za'Tual]]. I need someone capable to see him dispatched. Are you up to the task?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Sunreaver Bounty]] and {{cost|24|72|lcgf=5}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
You're dependable, <name>. I like that.

==Notes==
The least painful way to get to [[Arcweaver Jor'guva]]'s position from the ship is to cut through [[Ihgaluk Crag]] with the [[Skin of the Saurok (Horde)]] buff. Jor'guva is situated at {{co|44.0|69.0|Isle of Thunder}} immediately northwest of Ihgaluk Crag,  between the crag, [[Za'Tual]], and the [[Diremoor]]. See his article for abilities and tactics.
