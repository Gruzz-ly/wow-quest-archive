==Objectives==
Defeat the [[Thunder King]] within the [[Pinnacle of Storms]] and use the Staff of Antonidas to drain the remaining power from his dais.
*Staff of Antonidas charged
*[[Storm-Stave of Antonidas]]
*[[Staff of Antonidas]] (provided)

==Description==
It is rumored that the Thunder King's power comes directly from a hidden source within his palace.

Even when he is defeated a new tyrant, [[Garrosh]] perhaps, could still use this magic to a terrible end.

That is unless we make the first move!

Take my staff into the Pinnacle of Storms. Once Lei Shen has been defeated place my staff in the center of his dais.

We will drain the rest of his power and make sure it stays in our hands.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Glorious Standard of the Kirin Tor Offensive]] and {{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 XP
* +1000 reputation with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
We will be unstoppable once Lei Shen's power has been fused with my staff.

==Completion==
You have just secured our advantage, <name>. Your work here will be remembered.

Garrosh will be made to pay for his actions!

==Notes==
This quest is offered upon reaching {{rep|exalted}} standing with the [[Kirin Tor Offensive]].

On accept:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You've earned my trust, hero.  Simply place my staff on the Thunder King's dais and it will do the rest.  You are very brave to take this mission on; good luck!}}

Kill [[Lei Shen (tactics)|Lei Shen]] in the [[Throne of Thunder]] in any difficulty mode (Raid Finder, Normal, or Heroic).  See Lei Shen's article for more information.

Once he is dead, a ghostly placeholder of the staff will appear at the center of the [[Pinnacle of Storms (subzone)|Pinnacle of Storms]].  When clicked on, the staff rises up about hallway to the ceiling, absorbs all the lighting from it, and returns to you.  Return to Jaina.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You did it!  Incredible!  Pandaren [[Lorewalkers]] will be telling your story for generations!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I can feel it ... the Thunder King's power courses through my staff.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Best of all, you've forever disabled his infernal machine, leaving nothing for the Horde to claim as their own.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|When the time is right, I'll use this staff to bring the walls of Orgrimmar crashing down around Garrosh Hellscream's head.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Thank you, friend.  The Alliance is lucky to have you.}}
:''Jaina bows.''

As a bonus when ever you are near Jaina, she will buff you with Thunder's Boon, which increases damage done by 15% for 30 mins.
