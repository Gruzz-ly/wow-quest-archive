==Objectives==
Kill 9 Sunreaver Mana Wyrms.
*[[Sunreaver Mana Wyrm]] slain (9)

==Description==
Sometimes, even the smallest creatures can be the biggest threat.

The [[Sunreavers]] brought [[mana wyrm]]s with them. Though small in size they have the ability to cripple our casters in combat. Many have learned the hard way not to underestimate them.

They must be dealt with and quickly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|a-hp=75|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
What progress have you made?

==Completion==
You've made excellent progress today, <class>. Rest assured however, our work here is nowhere close to done.

==Notes==
[[Sunreaver Mana Wyrm]]s are found next to Sunreaver Mana Collectors all over the [[Dawnseeker Promontory]] and [[Wildvine Marsh]].

==Progression==
