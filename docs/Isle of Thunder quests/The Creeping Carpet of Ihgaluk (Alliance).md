==Objectives==
[[File:Ihgaluk Roach.jpg|thumb|[[Ihgaluk Roach]].]]
Crush 150 Ihgaluk Roaches.
*[[Ihgaluk Roach]] crushed (150)

==Description==
Ah, [[roach]]es! I once bought a pet roach in [[Booty Bay]].

Roaches will soak up disease like a sponge, and then spread it as far as they can run. Which is pretty far.

[[Ihgaluk Crag]] is crawling with the things, and they carry [[Skumblade tribe|Skumblade]] filth all over of this island. Crush as many of them as you can while you're there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
This should be fairly simple. Just smush them.

==Completion==
Every little bit helps.

==Notes==
Make sure to complete [[Skin of the Saurok (Alliance)]] for ease of movement in [[Ihgaluk Crag]]!

Don't focus on this quest while in Ihgaluk. Just keep running around.

==Progression==
