==Objectives==
[[File:Za'Tual setup 2.jpg|thumb|Lan'dalock's position in the Diremoor]]
Find [[Archmage Lan'dalock]] outside of [[Za'Tual]].

==Description==
The [[Zandalari]] have been a constant nuisance since we arrived on [[Isle of Thunder|this island]]. I've assigned Archmage Lan'dalock to take charge of dismantling their presence at Za'Tual, in the south.

Report to him when you are best able. He will have work for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|96}}
*59000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
One more to join the Zandalari hunt? Good. Very good.

==Notes==
Before completing [[The Assault on Shaol'mara]], Lan'dalock can be found inside the arcane bubble at the south end of [[Za'Tual]] at {{co|31.6|83.2|Isle of Thunder}} on a secluded portion of the beach bordering [[Backbreaker Bay]]. After taking the [[Violet Rise]], Lan'dalock's party is situated at {{co|42.2|66.3|Isle of Thunder||1}} near Za'Tual's southern entrance from the [[Diremoor]].

==Progression==
{{Kirin Tor Offensive dailies|1}}
