==Objectives==
Speak to [[Taran Zhu]] in [[Bleak Hollow]].

==Description==
The [[Shado-Pan]] arrived here before we did, and they are already at work undermining the [[Lei Shen|Thunder King's]] forces.

I want to you meet with Taran Zhu, the leader of the Shado-Pan, and offer your services on behalf of the [[Kirin Tor]]. I doubt he is truly in need of the aid, but the gesture holds importance in itself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Completion==
Welcome, <name>.

==Notes==
Use the teleporter on deck to reach [[Za'Tual]] and cut through the [[Zandalari troll]]-infested territory to reach the [[Diremoor]], the central swamp. An easy option is to head east around Za'Tual and the boneyard to reach the [[Ihgaluk Crag]] beach, then cut through Ihgaluk Crag with the aid of the [[Skin of the Saurok (Alliance)]] buff. Once in Diremoor, follow the main loop road to the northern part of the moor to reach the [[Emperor's Gate]], along the main path from the central shrine. Watch out for the wandering [[Mighty Devilsaur]] and [[Drakkari God-Hulk]] troll parties on the road!

Immediately west (to the left) of the gate is a cave, the [[Bleak Hollow]], which the [[Shado-Pan]] has claimed as their base. Speak with [[Taran Zhu]] inside:
:Lei Shen must not be allowed to marshal his full strength.
:A direct assault on the front gates will take time, and the aid of your Alliance and Horde. But if there is one thing we Shado-pan know it is that where there is a wall, there is a way around.
:The sewers at the back of this tunnel lead all the way to the fortress entrance. We must hold this entrance.
Taran Zhu's followup quest, [[Secrets in the Isle of Thunder]], is not part of the main progression, but it is something to do while otherwise questing.
