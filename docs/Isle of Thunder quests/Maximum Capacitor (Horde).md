==Objectives==
Interact with the three lightning drills in the [[Lightning Vein Mine]] to destroy them, and kill Metal Lord Mono-Han.
*Western Lightning Drill destroyed
*Central Lightning Drill destroyed
*Eastern Lightning Drill destroyed
*[[Metal Lord Mono-Han]] slain

==Description==
The mines north of here are being used to extract Ghost Iron ore and energize it with lightning energy. We need to destroy the drills they use to extract the ore. They are impervious to normal attack, but can be overloaded using the proper methods. Oh - and while you're there, take out whoever is running the operation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Completion==
Time to push ahead - to the forge!

==Notes==
Enter the [[Lightning Vein Mine]] at {{co|49|33|Isle of Thunder||1}} from the northwestern corner of the [[Beast Pens]] and turn left to find the Western Lightning Drill guarded by two [[Shan'ze Electromancer]]s. Take them out and interact with the drill to destroy it. Take the southern fork, heading east, then turn left to the north to head under the northern path to reach the pool, where thecentral drill can be found. Keep heading northeast to reach the northernmost extent of the mine to find the eastern drill. Kill a path to the eastern exit to reach the [[Thunder Forges]].

[[Metal Lord Mono-Han]] is pathing up and down the path on the lower level. See his article for abilities and tactics. On Mono-Han's death, the quest completes automatically.
