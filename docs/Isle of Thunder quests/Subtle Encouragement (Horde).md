==Objectives==
Plant Mogu Weapons into the corpses of 9 [[Skumblade tribe|Skumblade saurok]].
*Use Mogu Weapon on Skumblade corpse (9)

==Description==
The saurok are vile, but we share an enemy: the mogu. And I'd rather send saurok to kill mogu than send my own men.

We've been collecting mogu weaponry. Bury these polearms into the skulls of the saurok. Feed our enemies' rivalry, and you may save Horde lives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
As much as it pains me to say it: try not to kill them all. We need some alive if we want to turn them against the mogu.

==Completion==
Masterfully done, <class>.

==Notes==
Make sure to complete [[Skin of the Saurok (Horde)]] for ease of movement in [[Ihgaluk Crag]]!

Kill Skumblade saurok, then use the bonus action button to plant a mogu weapon into its corpse. The ability will stick weapons in as many corpses as possible, so don't think it has to be used after every kill.
