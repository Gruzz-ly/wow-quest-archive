'''Lightning Steel''' is started from the [[Strange Metal Ingot]], which drops from [[Itoka]], the master of the [[Thunder Forges]] on the [[Isle of Thunder]].

==Objectives==
Investigate the Thunder Forge to find the Secrets of Lightning Steel.

==Description==
Your trained eyes can see that this metal ingot has some very strange properties. Perhaps there are clues to its nature somewhere around here?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
{{itembox|
|Lightning Steel Ingot
|Notes on Lightning Steel}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|1|98|50}}
*23,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
While the language is incomprehensible, the diagrams in this book yield their knowledge to your skilled blacksmith's eye. It is clear that, by manipulating the properties of ghost iron, you can create a material of great power, perhaps powerful enough to recreate and increase the power of weapons long lost to the mists of time.

==Patch changes==
