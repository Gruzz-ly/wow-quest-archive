==Objectives==
Steal the Choker of Storms from [[Swollen Vault|The Swollen Vault]].
*[[Choker of Storms]]

==Description==
The Swollen Vault is a repository for some of Lei Shen's nastiest weaponry and most prized trinkets - not surprisingly, these are often one and the same.

One artifact in particular, an amulet known as the Choker of Storms, could help us to understand his apparent mastery over lightning.

Break into the vault and slay the [[Lu-Shero|hoard-keeper]]. Take his key and use it to recover the amulet from a cache at the back of the vault.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|45|60|lcgf=2}}
*471000 [[XP]]
*+400 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
The Thunder King's strength is legendary. We need every advantage we can get if we are to defeat him.

==Completion==
What's this? A necklace? What are you trying to- aah, I see... A relic from the Thunder King's vault! Fascinating... Powerful, too.

The Kirin Tor will keep it save. In return, please accept this.

==Notes==
Get to the [[Swollen Vault]], kill [[Lu-Shero]], and loot the [[Hoard-Keeper's Key]]. The pillars have a safe spot shown in one of the patterns listed on the Swollen Vault article. Complete the platforming puzzle to cross the way and use the key to loot the [[Choker of Storms]] from the chest.
