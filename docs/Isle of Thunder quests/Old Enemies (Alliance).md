==Objectives==
Kill 10 Sunreaver agents or players on the [[Isle of Thunder]].
*Sunreaver agents slain (10)

==Description==
To think, we were once on the same side! The [[Sunreavers]]' treachery caught us all off guard. Never again!

They have shown their true natures to us. Siding with [[Garrosh Hellscream|Garrosh]] and his madness has marked them all for death.

Kill any agent of the Sunreavers that you find. We will show them no mercy here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|a-hp=75|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
How many have been slain?

==Completion==
You have put a dent in the Sunreaver forces here. Like vermin, there will always be more. We must be at the ready at all times.

==Notes==
Valid units in the [[Wildvine Marsh]] and around the [[Dawnseeker Promontory]] include [[Sunreaver Magus]] and [[Silvermoon Spellbreaker]]. Additionally, any Horde players count. Note that the [[Sunreaver Construct]] arcane golems do ''not'' count for this quest, and neither do the [[Dawnseeker Guardian]]s defending Sunreaver quest givers on the promontory.
