==Objectives==
Disarm the [[Tactical Mana Bomb]]s at the Horde Ships, the Scrying Crystals, and the Bridge within [[Dawnseeker Promontory]].
*Ships Tactical Mana Bomb disarmed
*Crystal Tactical Mana Bomb disarmed
*Bridge Tactical Mana Bomb disarmed

==Description==
Well, it would seem the [[Jaina Proudmoore|Lady Proudmoore]] has decided to use our own weaponry against us. Our perimeter wards reported several [[Spy|spies]] slipping through our defenses carrying tactical mana bombs.

I would enjoy the irony if these bombs were less dangerous.

Search for these bombs and disarm them. Our wards reported one near the [[horde]] ships to the north, one on a bridge to the main isle, and one near our scrying crystals on the eastern side of the Promontory.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
I never thought I'd see the day when a Proudmoore would resort to [[mana bomb]]s. Tactical or no, they are hardly the weapon of choice for the morally balanced.

==Completion==
Good work. The real irony is had these been normal bombs we would have had a much harder time detecting them. Some [[Gnome|gnomish]] devilry could have spelled the end of our operation here.
