'''To the Skies!''' begins the fourth stage of the [[Isle of Thunder storyline]], gaining access to the [[Lightning Vein Mine]] and the [[Thunder Forges]]. Jaina will only offer this quest from her position on the [[Violet Rise]] once enough realm-wide progress has been made, irrespective of the individual player's standing with the [[Kirin Tor Offensive]].

Much like with the previous progression quest, [[Tear Down This Wall! (Alliance)]], this quest mostly takes place in a single-player scenario, also called "To the Skies!". As the scenario can only be completed once, it is documented here and not in a separate article.

==Objectives==
Gain access to the Lightning Vein Mine.
*Speak to [[Jaina Proudmoore]] to begin your mission {{co|63.2|72.2|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*Assault the [[Lightning Vein Mine]]

==Description==
We have a plan to halt the [[mogu]]'s weaponmaking capabilities, and it involves [[Wild Pterrorwing Hatchling (item)|the creature]] you recovered from the Zandalari.

Speak to me when you're ready to learn more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
It's time to begin your mission!

==Completion==
Incredible work. This presents us with a monumental opportunity.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Hail, friend!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I think I have a plan to infiltrate the Thunder King's armory. We'll use that creature you recovered, with a little help from the Shado-Pan.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Speak to me when you are ready to begin.}}
Speak with her again:
:{{gossip|I am ready! [Queue for solo instance.]}}
This will queue the adventurer for the "To the Skies!" single-player scenario.

===Stage 1 - Taking Off===
[[File:Thunderwing.jpg|thumb|Thunderwing]]

:''Mount your Thunderwing!''
*Mount Thunderwing {{co|63.3|74.3|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*Approach the Mine Entrance {{co|49|21|Isle of Thunder||1}}
Head south a few yards to approach the [[Thunderwing]]<!-- Thunderwing / 90 Pterrorwing Beast / Alliance / 70208 Violet Rise / 787,000 / Alive -->, Jaina and Vereesa, and the rest of the NPCs at the Violet Rise.
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Vereesa is waiting for you, champion.}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|This beautiful creature you rescued is immune to the lightning strikes that protect the island.}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Do you think you can ride it?}}
Hop on:
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Wonderful! Once you take to the skies, the Zandalari may come after you.}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Be ready to dogfight in the air. Jump from mount to mount if you have to!}}
:''The thunderwing takes off.''
:{{text|yell|Vereesa Windrunner|A Shado-Pan agent will meet you behind the mines. Good luck!}}
The pterrorwing will fly westward through the [[Diremoor]] then turn northward to start circling clockwise around the [[Lightning Vein Mine]] and the [[Thunder Forges]].

===Stage 2 - Intercepted===
[[File:To the Skies 2 - Ambush.jpg|thumb|Intercepted by Zandalari Beastcallers!]]

:''The Zandalari have spotted you! Defeat your attackers!''
*Defeat your Attackers! {{co|49.2|25.6|Isle of Thunder||1}}

[[Zandalari Beastcaller]]s fly up behind the adventurer and will start attacking it with throwing axes. Classes with ranged abilities may stay on their own mount, but the skyscreamers will occasionally get out of range of each other. It will thus likely be easier to '''Jump!''' with the bonus action button to the mount of the targeted beastcaller. While circling the mine, the champion is buffed with '''Thunderous Innervation''': "Killing enemies heals you for 30,000 every 1 sec for 5 sec."

One beastcaller will spawn, then two, then finally three. Take them all out. The skyscreamer will circle around before reaching the northwestern mine entrance, where [[Beastmaster Horaki]] will shoot the player off its mount!
:{{text|yell|Beastmaster Horaki|FOOLS! I will show you how it is done!}}

===Stage 3 - Master the Beastmaster===
[[File:To the Skies 3 - Beastmaster Horaki.jpg|thumb|Beastmaster Horaki]]

:''Horaki has knocked you from your mount! Defeat him!''
*Horaki defeated {{co|47.8|25.6|Isle of Thunder||1}}
:{{text|yell|Beastmaster Horaki|Did ya think ya could just fly ova' hea' unnoticed?!}}
:{{text|yell|Beastmaster Horaki|Well, ya got where you were goni'. Too bad you're not gonna live long enough to see it!}}
:{{text|yell|Beastmaster Horaki|Prepare to die, intrudah!}}

[[Beastmaster Horaki]] is a level-90 elite Zandalar troll with nearly three million health. See his article for a full strategy, but get out of the Frost Shot area of effect before he launches the Hail of Arrows. The hails will last for the rest of the encounter, so get just outside of the arrows' area of effect (marked by a red circle) to not waste space.

Finish him off to start the next stage.

===Stage 4 - Into the Mines===
[[File:To the Skies 4 - Meet up with Taoshi.jpg|thumb|Meeting up with Taoshi]]

:''Meet up with Taoshi, your Shado-Pan Contact.''
*Joined with Taoshi {{co|49.3|26.0|Isle of Thunder||1}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Well now. You sure know how to arrive in style.}}

Taoshi is standing by the cave-in. Speak with her:
:I will destroy this cave in, and then we can sneak in from behind. Let me know when you are ready.
:{{gossip|Alright. Let's go.}}

===Stage 5 - What's Yours is Mine===
[[File:To the Skies 5 - Blowing up the cave in.jpg|thumb|Blowing up the cave in]]

:''Make your way to the mine's main door.''
*Cave-in cleared {{co|49.5|25.5|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*Make Your Way to the Mine Entrance {{co|32.3|57.7|Lightning Vein Mine}} / {{co|49.2|29.1|Isle of Thunder||1}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Let's get down to business.}}
:''Taoshi runs up to the cave-in, drops a bomb, and then takes cover behind the adventurer.''

Head into the freshly-opened mine and start killing a path to the southwest through [[Shan'ze Electrocutioner]]s, [[Shan'ze Slaver]]s, and [[Saurok Slave]]s to reach the southern entrance. During this time, Taoshi will chime in randomly:
*{{text|say|Taoshi|I have seen many things. But the cruelty of the mogu still curdles my blood.}}
*{{text|say|Taoshi|Slaves - everywhere slaves. You can see what we fight against.}}
*{{text|say|Taoshi|We are in the heart of the mogu war machine.}}
*{{text|say|Taoshi|The Shado-Pan strike from the shadows, so that our enemies fear the dark.}}

===Final Stage - Cover Me===
[[File:To the Skies 6 - Taoshi and Shiaxu.jpg|thumb|Taoshi and Shiaxu]]
[[File:Slavemaster Shiaxu.jpg|thumb|[[Slavemaster Shiaxu]].]]

:''Cover Taoshi while she deactivates the lock on the mine door, and defeat Slavedriver Shiaxu.''
*Shiaxu Defeated {{co|27.9|66.5|Lightning Vein Mine}} / {{co|48.7|30.2|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*Mine door unlocked
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Step lightly! We are almost to the gate.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|There - the slave master! Hold his attention while I undo the lock.}}
:{{text|yell|Slavemaster Shiaxu|What is this? Another uprising?}}
:''Taoshi drops what she's doing and runs to the southern door.''

[[Slavemaster Shiaxu]] is a level-90-elite mogu with 2 million health. See his article for abilities and full tactics. In short, get out of the '''Capture''' area of effect, as he will '''Deadly Kick''' the same area on his next attack, and get at least 40 yards away from the shackles to break the '''Chains'''.

Finish him off:
:{{text|yell|Slavemaster Shiaxu|You will be... punished...}}
:{{text|yell|Taoshi|I have it! The gates are undone!}}

This completes the "Take the Forge" portion of [[Isle of Thunder (achievement)]] as the scenario concludes.

===Finale===
[[File:To the Skies 6 - Alliance finale.jpg|thumb|Wrapping up with Jaina]]

:{{text|yell|Vereesa Windrunner|Rangers! Secure the forge. Smash the gate, so it cannot be closed!}}
:''[[Silver Covenant Ranger (Isle of Thunder)|Silver Covenant Rangers]] charge in and clear the mine of mogu.''
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Lady Proudmoore, it is safe for you to enter.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|You two did it! I knew the Shado-Pan would make excellent allies.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|We share a common enemy, Lady Proudmoore. Nothing more.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|But together we have delivered a terrible blow to the Thunder King!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Vereesa, gather up everything we can find before the mogu return. Leave nothing for the Horde to claim.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|My lady. Weapons of the Thunder King are an abomination. They should be destroyed.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Oh, they will be. But knowledge is power, and I will never turn down an opportunity to study something new. Thank you, Taoshi.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|And thank YOU, hero. It will be difficult to hold the forge, but think of what we can learn here!}}
Use the portal behind Jaina to return to Violet Rise.

==Notes==
If you are doing this as a [[hunter]], you may find the '''Intercepted!''' part very hard, heaving good endzone gear will be a boon. Keep in mind that [[Spirit Bond (hunter talent)]] is useless without your pet. Should you want to keep the ability, buy two [[Tome of the Clear Mind]] and exchage your ability with [[Exhilaration]]. Also, try to stun them with [[scatter Shot]] and use a [[Heavy Windwool Bandage]] to heal.

==Progression==
