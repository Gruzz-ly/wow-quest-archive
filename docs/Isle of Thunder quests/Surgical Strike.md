*[[Zandalari Jaguar Warrior]] slain (3)
*[[Zandalari Spiritbinder]] slain (3)

==Description==
Zandalari spiritbinders peform sacrifices to their gods, the beastcallers bend innocent skyscreamers to their will, and the jaguar warriors venture closer to us by the day.

Dispose of these threats in [[Za'Tual]], <race>, and watch the might of the trolls weaken.

You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Have you found the trolls you seek?

==Completion==
With a few of their more dangerous kin slain, perhaps the Zandalari will show some reluctance next time they decide to trifle with us.

==Notes==
Look specifically for Zandalar trolls of the specified classes. The three named spiritbinders do count as well.
