==Objectives==
Recover a [[Wild Pterrorwing Hatchling]].
*[[Wild Pterrorwing Hatchling (item)]]

==Description==
I've just received a report that another young [[pterodactyl|pterrorwing]] has been spotted in the [[Diremoor]].

We need to recover as many of these as we can find. They may be the key to flying on [[Isle of Thunder|this island]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
A great gloom looms over this island...

==Completion==
Wonderful! I'll pass him off to our caretaker. Thank you.

==Notes==
There are two hatchlings in the [[Diremoor]]. One flies each path, landing at the points shown below. The eastern pterrorwing flies in a clockwise loop, where the western one flies a more complicated path but lands at the five points counterclockwise. The landing points are numbered starting from the northernmost landing point.
