This quest starts being offered once [[Isle of Thunder storyline#Take the Forge|Stage 3]] of the [[Isle of Thunder storyline]] has begun. The [[:Head of the Chamberlain]] spawns in various locations all over the southern half of the island -- the [[Court of Bones (Isle of Thunder)|Court of Bones]], [[Ihgaluk Crag]], and [[Za'Tual]], as well as the lower portion of Lei Shen's Citadel: the [[Beast Pens]] and [[Conqueror's Terrace]]. As the latter two areas are gated until Stage 3, this quest will not be offered until after players have completed [[Tear Down This Wall! (quest)]]

==Objectives==

[[File:Torso of the Keymaster setup.jpg|thumb|[[Torso of the Chamberlain]]]]

Recover the Shoulder, Head, Staff, Hair and Torso of the Chamberlain.
*[[Head of the Chamberlain]] (provided)
*[[Shoulder of the Chamberlain]]
*[[Staff of the Chamberlain]]
*[[Hair of the Chamberlain]]
*[[Torso of the Chamberlain]]

==Description==
You there! Assist me.

In life I was the Royal Chamberlain for his majesty, the [[Lei Shen|Thunder King]]. For my dedication, I was condemned to this stone form, forever forced to watch over a portion of his wealth.

Someone has desecrated my glorious body and sent pieces of it across [[Isle of Thunder|the island]]. The thought of spending an eternity without my body depresses me.

Search the island, recover these pieces and I shall grant you one of his majesty's treasures.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}} and [[Shan'ze Ritual Stone]]
*236000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I require ALL of my pieces. If so much a pebble is missing, I shall consider forfeiting our agreement.

==Completion==
Ah! To feel whole again! You have my gratitude, servant. Take this stone and use it wisely. Should you encounter his majesty the Thunder King in your travels, do not tell him where you received the key, or you will be standing in a statue next to me for the remainder of eternity.

==Notes==
This is a weekly quest, offered by a [[Head of the Chamberlain]] object that spawns in various locations around the island.

The objects are also strewn about in a handful of locations. The [[Shoulder of the Chamberlain]] will be somewhere in [[Ihgaluk Crag]], accessible only by jumping with the Skin of the Saurok buff. The [[Staff of the Chamberlain]] is at an out-of-the-way area in [[Za'Tual]]. The [[Hair of the Chamberlain]] is on top of a building in the [[Beast Pens]] or the [[Conqueror's Terrace]]. The [[Torso of the Chamberlain]] is either on top of a building or in an out-of-the-way spot in the [[Court of Bones (Isle of Thunder)|Court of Bones]].

If the adventurer somehow manages to complete this quest within 10 minutes of picking it up, the achievement [[The Crumble Bundle]] will be awarded.

While the adventurer is killing mobs, the head will chime in on occasion:
*{{text|whisper|Ah! Now that was a proper smiting. There is hope for you yet.}}
*{{text|whisper|Enough dilly dallying, supplicant! I demand you assemble my body.}}
*{{text|whisper|I have seen saurok with more fighting panache than what you just displayed.}}
*{{text|whisper|I survived for hundreds of years during the Thunder King's reign. Do you know how? By not keeping my masters waiting!}}
*{{text|whisper|Oh sure. You have time to kill hapless island folk but no time to assemble my glorious body?}}
*{{text|whisper|Was that thing you just killed carrying part of my body? No? Well then I demand ten percent of the loot.}}
*{{text|whisper|What a pitiful creature. And the thing you just killed.}}
*{{text|whisper|You call that slaying an opponent? I expected more... fire. Or maybe some lightning.}}
