==Objectives==
Kill the Arcane Destroyer.
*[[Arcane Destroyer (Isle of Thunder)|Arcane Destroyer]] slain

==Description==
Jaina thinks this battle will be easily won. I intend to show her how wrong she is!

The Kirin Tor brought a weapon with them that must be destroyed. The Arcane Destroyer is a large construct capable of turning the tides of war in their favor.

Destroying this monstrosity would send a very clear message to Proudmoore.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|h-hp=75|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Does the Destroyer still stand?

==Completion==
I wish I could be there to see the look on Proudmoore's face as she mourns the loss of her death machine!

We can be certain she will build another, but we have at least set her back.
