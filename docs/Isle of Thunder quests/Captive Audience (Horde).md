==Objectives==
Free 5 Sunreaver Captives around [[Violet Rise]].
*Free [[Sunreaver Captive]]s (5)

==Description==
The [[Kirin Tor Offensive|Kirin Tor]] have gone too far! Now they hold our fellow Sunreavers as war prisoners!

There will be no discussion of prisoner exchange. We will handle this ourselves.

Go to Violet Rise and free as many prisoners as you can. Do not get captured yourself. We cannot afford to lose you too.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
What news do you have of our fellow agents?

==Completion==
Those you have rescued today would no doubt thank you, if they had the strength.

Our task here will be ongoing. I refuse to leave anyone behind!

==Notes==
*Although the captives can be freed while mounted, players should note that doing so will cause the Rune Trap to not vanish and thus not respawn with a new captive for others that seek to preform the quest.
