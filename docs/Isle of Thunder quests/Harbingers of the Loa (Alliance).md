==Objectives==
Slay 2 Harbingers of the Loa
*Defeat Harbingers of the Loa (2)

==Description==
If you spend some time in [[Za'Tual]], you will likely see one of their large tents emanating a pure form of evil.

Please, venture into the troll camp and put a stop to these rituals.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
The rituals must be stopped!

==Completion==
Most who witness such rituals never return, and those who do tend to be shaken. You, <name>, seem little moved by your incredible deeds. I am impressed.

==Notes==

In [[Za'Tual]], look for big tents with lightning sparks coming out of them. Inside will be a [[Zandalari Arcanital (Isle of Thunder)|Zandalari Arcanital]], a [[Zandalari Speaker]], or a [[Zandalari Spiritweaver]]. Kill it, then look for another.
