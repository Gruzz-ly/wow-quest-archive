Kill Zur'chaka the Bonecrafter.
*[[Zur'chaka the Bonecrafter]] slain {{co|54.5|45.2|Isle of Thunder||1}}

==Description==
We've spotted a Zandalari leader up the [[Emperor's Gate|central stairs]]. We need to eliminate him before returning to camp.

Would you be willing to do the deed?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Arcane Trove]] and {{cost|24|72|lcgf=5}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
You're a good <class> to have around, that's for certain. Thank you.

==Notes==
Cut through to the [[Emperor's Gate]] and head up the central stairs to find [[Zur'chaka the Bonecrafter]], who has relocated here from the [[Za'Tual boneyard]]. See his article for abilities and tactics to defeat him, but be warned that the pack of [[Skeletal Lashling]]s will patrol right through Zur'chaka's position, so pull him further up the stairs.
