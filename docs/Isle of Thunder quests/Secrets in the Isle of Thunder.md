==Objectives==
Recover 3 Shan'ze Ritual Stones. These stones are very rare, and may take some time to gather.
*[[Shan'ze Ritual Stone]] (3)

==Description==
I do have one thing I would ask of you, <class>.

We've gotten our hands on a powerful ritual stone that the Shan'ze mogu use to beckon their allies into battle, but we need more than one to perform their rituals.

If you come upon 3 of these stones, bring them back to me. We can gather our forces and use these stones to beckon some of Lei Shen's most powerful servants directly into our traps.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan Assault]]

==Progress==
Have you found the stones I speak of?

==Completion==
Perfect. I will show you how to use these stones, and then you can spring the ambush.

==Notes==
While otherwise questing on the [[Isle of Thunder]], adventurers will come across a [[Shan'ze Ritual Stone]] in hidden coffers or on the corpses of [[Champions of Lei Shen]]. Gather three, but don't grind for them. This quest is not designed to be completed on the spot, as the eventual repeatable followup is a weekly quest. See the ritual stone article for more information on sources.

Turning in the quest will give the adventurer back the three [[Shan'ze Ritual Stone]]s that were turned in to Taran Zhu, so fear not.

==Progression==
