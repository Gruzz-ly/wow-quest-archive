==Objectives==
Defeat 10 Zandalari trolls in the [[Beast Pens]].
*Beast Pens Trolls slain (10)

==Description==
Inside the Beast Pens you will encounter some of the most skilled beast tamers in the Zandalari military. They are trained to kill with axe, beast, and claw. This is where they build their cavalry.

We need you to kill any Zandalari you find in there before they can get their mounted monstrosities out into the open battlefield.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Good luck.

==Completion==
A trained Zandalari beastcaller with a mount unleashed on the battlefield can kill twenty times their number. Your preemptive attack has saved many lives. Thank you!
