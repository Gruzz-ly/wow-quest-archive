Suggested Players [5]

==Description==
Take these 3 ritual stones to the location I have marked on your map. There, you will find a Shan'ze ritual object that you can use to beckon one of their powerful allies.

You will need capable friends at your side for this trap to work. Do not go alone, for these will be some of the Thunder King's most powerful servants.

When your enemy show himself, show no mercy.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Shado-Pan Assault]]

==Progress==
Did the ambush succeed?

==Completion==
Very impressive.

Should you find more stones, you should continue to use this ruse. It is sure to be quite some time before they catch on to our ploy.

==Notes==
The [[Echo of Kros]] is summoned at the [[Skumblade tribe]] sacrificial altar on the southeastern beach of [[Ihgaluk Crag]]. If [[Kroshik]] is currently being sacrificed, today is not a good day to do this quest, as part of the encounter will have the echo move back to it's summoning spot to eat a saurok to regain four million health. See the echo's article for information about summoning the devilsaur ghost and tactics for defeating it.
