==Objectives==
Free the Tormented Skyscreamer.
*[[Tormented Skyscreamer]] freed {{co|41|70|Isle of Thunder}}

==Description==
One of the trolls' [[skyscreamer]]s in [[Za'Tual]] is undergoing a ritual of torture, its will being bent forever to serve its masters.

Kill those that inflict such torment on the creature and we can only hope that it will return to the skies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Have you freed the creature?

==Completion==
I hope that creature has the intelligence necessary to know who saved it. It seems to me that it would be a dangerous foe if provoked.

==Notes==
At {{co|41|70|Isle of Thunder}} on the northeast side of [[Za'Tual]] are three [[Zandalari Arcweaver]]s channeling something at the [[Tormented Skyscreamer]]. Kill all three and the skyscreamer will fly free.

==Progression==
