==Objectives==
Plant a Tactical Mana Bomb on an Alliance Ship, Alliance Supply Shipment, and on the Construct Ritual.
*Bomb placed on Alliance Ship
*Bomb placed on Supply Shipment
*Bomb placed on Construct Ritual
*[[Case of Tactical Mana Bombs]] (provided)

==Description==
Ah, <name>, just the <race> I was looking for. I have received another batch of tactical mana bombs that I need planted in key positions across [[Violet Rise]] to the southeast.

Here, take these. I do not trust our standard soldiers with such firepower. Oh... and don't shake them, whatever you do.

Plant one of the Kirin Tor ships, another one near their supplies, and the last on the construct they are building.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|h-hp=75|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
The tactical mana bomb was a joint research project of Kirin Tor mages during the war with the Lich King. Sadly their design was not perfected until only just recently. We could have used such weapons then.

==Completion==
I am sure the use of even these smaller mana bombs has Jaina squirming with rage. Serves her right.

Dalaran was my home before her grandparents were born. What right did she have to expel me from my home?
