==Objectives==
Destroy 3 Fetid Meat Piles.
*[[Fetid Meat Pile]] destroyed (3)

==Description==
The [[Skumblade tribe|Skumblade saurok]] do not eat all of the meat they hunt. They reserve large portions of it to rot in piles near their homes, attracting pests and spreading disease.

We can't have the saurok spreading their disease beyond the borders of [[Ihgaluk Crag]]. Dispose of any excess meat that you find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
I know of many ways to spread disease, but this one is novel.

==Completion==
Left standing, those piles of discarded food are the perfect breeding ground for disease.

Were I still in the disease-spreading business, I'd consider using them myself.

==Notes==
Make sure to complete [[Skin of the Saurok (Alliance)]] for ease of movement in [[Ihgaluk Crag]]!

Look for Fetid Meat Piles and kill them. [[Fetid Bloodworm]]s will pop out as the pile is damaged. Take them out too.
