==Objectives==
Destroy 6 Zandalari Offerings.
*[[Zandalari Offering]]s destroyed (6)

==Description==
The spirtibinders of the Zandalari perform sacrificial rites to appease the loa and their vile gods. These dark rituals involve the sacrifice of our people. Destroy any offerings you can find among their tents in Za'Tual and perhaps we can stall the sacrifices.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
I truly hope this helps slow them down. The sacrifices proceed at an alarming rate.

==Completion==
The tide of blood is slowed, at least for a time. Thank you for your efforts in stalling the sacrifices, <class>.
