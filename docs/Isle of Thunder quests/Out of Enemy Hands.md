==Objectives==
Steal 7 Loa-Infused Blades from [[Conqueror's Terrace]]
*[[Loa-Infused Blade]] (7)

==Description==
Magic is a frightening opponent when wielded by an experienced caster. A blade however, is terrifying in even the most inexperienced hands.

The Zandalari have some impressive weapons, made even more deadly by the magic they are enhanced with. We should relieve them of this advantage.

Steal as many of the weapons as you can find.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
What did you find out there? Anything that can be of use?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <class>! These weapons are impressive. Now we have a few less things to worry about in the field of battle.

==Notes==
Blades are found all over the terrace on hooks at the sides of tables and in weapon racks next to tents.

==Progression==
