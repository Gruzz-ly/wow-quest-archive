==Objectives==
Travel with [[Vereesa Windrunner]] to the [[Isle of Thunder]].
*Speak with Vereesa
*Isle of Thunder discovered

==Description==
There is no time to waste, <name>. Every moment we delay here gives the [[Sunreavers]] more of a hold on the Isle.

[[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]] awaits us. We should not make her wait any longer.

Speak to me when you are ready to depart. I will escort you there myself.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Kirin Tor Beacon]] and {{cost|4|96}}
*59000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Completion==
You have arrived just in time, <name>. This land needs to be controlled by the Kirin Tor for everyone's safety. This will not be an easy task.

==Notes==
Speak with her again:
:There is no time to waste. The Horde move on the Isle of Thunder as we speak!
:{{gossip|''I'm ready to go.''}}
:''Vereesa and the adventurer mount up on hippogryphs and start flying north.''
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Over 12,000 years ago, the mogu empire was founded by Lei Shen, "The Thunder King."}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|He united the mogu, defeated the other pandaren races, and built an empire that would last for thousands of years.}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Legend has it that the Thunder King possessed enormous power, and built himself a palatial fortress.  We should be able to see it soon...}}
:''A loading screen appears, and on the other side of it, Vereesa and the adventurer have reached the southern side of the Isle of Thunder, south of [[Ihgaluk Crag]].''

The rest of Vereesa's speech and text no longer activates, but is still interesting to note for lore.

:{{text|say|Vereesa Windruner|There it is!  The Isle of the Thunder King.  Already, the Horde is circling it like hungry birds of prey.}}
<nowiki>/script PlaySoundFile("Sound/creature/Vereesa/VO_52_Ally_Vereesa_Intro_07.OGG")</nowiki>
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|If the Thunder King is not defeated, Pandaria will suffer.  But worse: if the Horde lays their hands on the source of his power, the whole WORLD will pay the price.}}
:''A lightning bolt strikes the water yards away from Vereesa.''
<nowiki>/script PlaySoundFile("Sound/creature/Vereesa/VO_52_Ally_Vereesa_Intro_08.OGG")</nowiki>
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Whoa - look out!  We have to land.  It is almost impossible to fly here!}}
<nowiki>/script PlaySoundFile("Sound/creature/Vereesa/VO_52_Ally_Vereesa_Intro_09.OGG")</nowiki>
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Lady Jaina Proudmoore would like to see you as soon as possible.}}
:''Vereesa and the adventurer land on deck of ''[[Seabolt|The Seabolt]]'', one of three [[Kirin Tor Offensive]] ships in [[Backbreaker Bay]].''
Speak with Jaina to continue.

On completion:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|This has been the worst year of my life: Theramore, destroyed. And a betrayal from within the Kirin Tor.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|The lesson is clear. From here on out, I'm taking the initiative.}}
:''Jaina steps over to the port side of the ship and summons a [[Bound Water Elemental (NPC)|Bound Water Elemental]] from the water, which jumps up on deck and follows Jaina back to her earlier position.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Just down the coast, the Horde is searching for a place to land their troops.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|They seek to defeat the Thunder King, not to protect Pandaria, but to claim his power for themselves.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|But this time, we're a step ahead.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|The Horde will find no purchase on these shores. And when the Thunder King lies beaten, the Pandaren will see that it was Alliance heroes who stood by them in their hour of need.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|This fight will take everything we have. I hope you're ready.}}

This completes the "First Landing" criterion of the [[Isle of Thunder (achievement)]] quest achievement.
