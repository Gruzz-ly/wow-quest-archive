'''A Bold Idea''' begins the fifth stage of the [[Isle of Thunder storyline]], gaining access to the [[Stormsea Landing]]. Taoshi will only offer this quest from her position on the [[Violet Rise]] once enough realm-wide progress has been made, irrespective of the individual player's standing with the [[Kirin Tor Offensive]].

Much like with the previous progression quest, [[To the Skies! (Alliance)]], this quest mostly takes place in a single-player scenario called "Stormsea Landing". As the scenario can only be completed once, it is documented here and not in a separate article.

==Objectives==
Infiltrate [[Stormsea Landing]] and open the courtyard gate from within. Speak with [[Taoshi]] to begin the mission.
*Infiltrate Stormsea Landing

==Description==
Zandalari [[warship]]s plunder the seas around this island. They ferry in soldiers and war beasts from [[Zandalar]] to bolster [[Lei Shen|Lei Shen's]] army.

If we can capture the palace [[shipyard]], the Thunder King's supply line will be cut off, and your foothold here will be secure.

I have a plan to do just that, and it won't take an entire army.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Completion==
Well done. That warship won't be raining fire on us again any time soon.

[[Taran Zhu]] has informed me that the [[Shado-Pan]] will keep vigil over Stormsea Landing, freeing Kirin Tor resources to press the siege elsewhere. Taoshi will be there. I am sure she will be glad to work with you again.

We are all grateful for your contributions, <name>. Thank you.

Once enough realm-wide progress has been made, [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Taoshi]], and [[Taran Zhu]] move over by the stables. Taoshi will offer this quest.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Ah! Hero, we were just talking about you.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|It does not matter. Taoshi's proposal is too dangerous.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|If we are to bring down the Thunder King, we must breech the shipyard. Now is the time for bold ideas!}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Champion, hear me out: We strike the shipyard at night, using this magnificent beast you have tamed.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Once inside, we sabotage the Zandalari ship. In the chaos, we will slip into the courtyard and open the gates from within.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|I love it! Brains over brute force.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Very well, Taoshi. If our champion here agrees, the mission may proceed.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Thank you, Lord Zhu. I will not let you down.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Speak with me when you are ready.}}

Speak with her again:
:I believe [[Thunderwing]] here is our opportunity to score a devastating blow against Lei Shen.
:{{gossip|I'm with you. Let's break into that shipyard! [Queue for solo instance.]}}

===Stage 1: Blending In===
[[File:A Bold Idea 1 - Taoshi and Thunderwing.jpg|thumb|Taoshi and Thunderwing]]
[[File:A Bold Idea 1 - The doomed patrol.jpg|thumb|The doomed patrol]]

:''Ride Thunderwing to scout Stormsea Landing from the air.''
*Intercept the Zandalari Patrol {{co|67.9|45.5|Isle of Thunder||1}}
Step a few yards closer to Taoshi and Thunderwing:
:{{text|say|Taoshi|I count six... no, seven guards on patrol in the sky.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|One of them flies higher than the others... He loops far out over the water - alone. He is over-extending. That is our in.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|We will neutralize him and take his route. Let's go!}}

Hop on. Taoshi will take the skyscreamer northward and attack the over-reaching guard:
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Just a little closer...}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Hyah!}}

===Stage 2: Path of Smoke===
[[File:A Bold Idea 2 - Clearing a path.jpg|thumb|The path to clear]]

:''Drop smoke bombs on sentry totems to deactivate them.''
*Sentry Totems deactivated x10
:{{text|say|Taoshi|The Zandalari are more cautious than I thought. Look down there - swarming with patrols.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|And their shaman have laid out a network of sentry totems.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|One of these smoke bombs will blind a sentry totem.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Clear a path from the ship to the gate at the upper level - we will need to cross on foot.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|We cannot circle up here for long. Do what you can while I plan our next move.}}
:''The skyscreamer makes a first pass, heading a bit further southwest to get closer to the main gate, where [[Shan Bu]] is awakening [[Hu'seng the Gatekeeper]].''
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Awaken, Hu'seng! The docks are your responsibility. See that none pass his majesty's gates.}}
:{{text|say|Hu'seng the Gatekeeper|The Thunder King wills it; it shall be done.}}

While on Thunderwing, the champion has access to one ability:
*{{abilities|Smoke Bomb|Throws a smoke bomb that will blind a Zandalari sentry totem, allowing you to sneak past on foot.|id=137246|icon=ability_rogue_smoke}}

Use the smoke bomb to take out 10 totems. Taoshi will only allow ten to be taken out, so choose targets wisely!

===Stage 3: Shadows in the Storm===
[[File:A Bold Idea 3 - Neutralizing guards.jpg|thumb|Neutralizing guards]]
[[File:A Bold Idea 3 - Trapping siege weapons.jpg|thumb|Trapping siege weapons]]

:''Knock out the crew members marked by Taoshi and sneak to the siege weapons at the front of the ship.''
*[[Veteran Wingrider|Marked crew members]] neutralized x7
*Siege weapons trapped by Taoshi x4
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Our time is up. We need to get aboard that ship.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|We should sabotage the siege weapons toward the bow. Then we will go below decks and find the captain.}}
:''Taoshi lands Thunderwing on deck astern, portside.''
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Easy now... Get in close and incapacitate them.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Taoshi nods towards the crewman on the right. Sneak up behind him to knock him out!}}

On foot, Taoshi buffs the champion with Infiltrating Stormsea Landing: "Taoshi uses Wu Kao shadow arts to stealth herself and her ally, enabling the use of Knock Out on targets afflicted by Mark of Taoshi. May be detected by enemies within 5 yards or revealed by sentry totems." The champion will have a 5-yard-radius circle extending from it's position. So long as no zandalari get within that circle, the champion will stay stealthed. However, to use '''Knock Out''', which is provided via the bonus action button, get behind the marked [[Veteran Wingrider]] and inch forward until the red circle includes the NPC. This will bring up the bonus action button, so use it.

If the champion's cover is blown, Taoshi will drop a purple smoke flare on the ground that functions like a [[Vanish]]:
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Here! Into the smoke!}}

Step into it to regain stealth.

After knocking out the wingrider on the right, Taoshi will inch foward and indicate two wingriders standing to the starboard side of deck. Another is patrolling behind them, so make sure to take the two standing guards out when the patrolling one isn't looking. Once those two are down, Taoshi will sneak foward and casually knock out the patrolling wingrider. Take out the next to marked wingriders to continue. Taoshi will neutralize another, then trap the two starboard siege weapons:
:{{text|say|Taoshi|There will be a very unpleasant surprise waiting for the next troll who disturbs these. Let's keep moving.}}

Taoshi will mark one of two wingriders near the skyscreamers. Tap it and Taoshi will do her thing, then trap the two port-side siege weapons. Incapacitate the last wingrider to finish this stage.

===Stage 4: Wetwork===
[[File:A Bold Idea 4 - Taoshi and Halu'kal.jpg|thumb|Taoshi and Halu'kal]]

:''Head below decks and assassinate Captain Halu'kal.''
*[[Captain Halu'kal]] slain {{co|67.1|47.4|Isle of Thunder||1}}
:''Taoshi keeps moving astern past the last wingrider and heads below deck via the now-opened pathway down. Once below decks, she inches forward until she spots Captain Halu'kal:
:{{text|bossemote|Taoshi motions at Captain Halu'kal, then draws a finger across her neck.}}

Follow Taoshi forward, then get within range of Halu'kal and attempt to kill him:
:{{text|emote|Captain Halu'kal snores peacefully.}}
:{{text|say|Captain Halu'kal|Hm-wha? Stowaways!}}

[[Captain Halu'kal]] is a level-90 elite Zandalar troll with 2 million health. See his article for abilities and a full strategy.

Get out of the '''Wallop''' area of effect and try to run away from the '''Keg Toss'''. Halu'kal will gain '''Well Fed''' on occasion, which will heal him and increase his damage output for ~12 seconds.

Occasionally, a [[Drunken Wingrider]] will awaken with a terrible '''Hangover'''. Take it out or not (it only has 788K health), but keep focusing on the captain.

Finish him off:
:{{text|say|Captain Halu'kal|You never get outta here... alive.}}

===Stage 5: Keep Quiet===
[[File:A Bold Idea 5 - Keep Quiet.jpg|thumb|Dodge the patrols]]
[[File:A Bold Idea 5 - Hu'seng.jpg|thumb|{{NPC||Hu'seng the Gatekeeper}}]]
[[File:A Bold Idea 6 - Hu'seng and Taoshi.jpg|thumb|Hu'seng and Taoshi]]

:''Sneak across the shipyard and up the hill to reach Hu'seng the Gatekeeper.''
*[[Hu'seng the Gatekeeper]] located {{co|59.2|44.6|Isle of Thunder||1}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Not as quiet as I would prefer, but it works.}}
:''Taoshi makes her way to the exit below deck.''
:{{text|say|Taoshi|The courtyard gate is directly up that hill.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Remember to stay clear of those sentry totems.}}

Taoshi will tag along beside the adventurer. Assuming a decent path was made, move along it to get up the hill toward the gate. [[Zandalari Spirit-Twister]]s and [[Zandalari Beast Handler]]s lead [[Zandalari Conscript]]s in patrols of the grounds. Steer clear of the patrols and also of the blue circles denoting the range of the sentry totems.

Should the champion enter the detection radius of a sentry totem, the totem will move a beam of light in the direction of whomever it detected. If the beam reaches the intruder, it will break the champion's and Taoshi's stealth for 10 seconds.

Along the way, the trolls find out about the trapped siege weapons the hard way:
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Sounds like they found our little present.}}

Keep moving up the hill and get close to Hu'seng:
:{{text|yell|Hu'seng the Gatekeeper|Enough hiding, little ones!}}

===Stage 6: Light Up the Night===
[[File:A Bold Idea 6 - Chained.jpg|thumb|Chained]]
[[File:A Bold Idea 6 - Lightning Storm.jpg|thumb|Lightning storm]]

:''Slay Hu'seng the Gatekeeper and recover his key.''
*[[Hu'seng the Gatekeeper]] slain {{co|59.2|44.6|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*[[Gatekeeper's Orb]]
:{{text|say|Hu'seng the Gatekeeper|There is no escape now. The only way out is through me!}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Through you, is it? I think we can manage that.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Would you prefer we go through the belly, or the ribcage?}}

[[Hu'seng the Gatekeeper]] is a level-92 elite [[terracotta warrior]] with almost 4 million health. See his article for abilities and a full strategy. 

Hu'seng will likely start off with an '''Empower Axe''' cast. Start running away from him with help via the '''Fixate''' speed increase, but don't get too far that he starts casting '''Hook'''.

At 50% of total health remaining, Hu'seng will cast '''Cease''', summoning chains that will root the champion in place. The chains only have ~100K health, so quickly destroy them before he gets his '''Desist''' cast off, which will hit all units in the marked area of effect for ~150K Physical damage.

At 20% total health remaining, Lei Shen will get upset and unleash a '''Lightning Storm''' upon the area. Standing in the pools will inflict 15K Nature damage a second, so move quickly.

Finish Hu'seng off:
:{{text|say|Hu'seng the Gatekeeper|None... shall...}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Well fought! Now - the gates. Before the thunder king's entire army comes down on us!}}
Loot the [[Gatekeeper's Orb]] from Hu'seng's corpse.

===Final Stage: Breaking Out===
[[File:A Bold Idea 7 - Breaking out.jpg|thumb|Open the gate]]
[[File:A Bold Idea 8 - finale.jpg|thumb|Vereesa and Taoshi]]

:''Use the Gatekeeper's Orb to open the gate to the Bloodied Crossing.''
*Gate opened {{co|58.6|42.9|Isle of Thunder||1}}
Tollow Taoshi up the steps to the [[Bloodied Crossing]] and use the orb on the Deactivated Access Generator.

This completes the "Assault the Shipyard" portion of [[Isle of Thunder (achievement)]].

:''The gates slam open!''
:{{text|yell|Vereesa Windrunner|Rangers - shatter the hinges. Wedge the doors open!}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Your plan worked! The two of you accomplished the work of an army.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|The fighting skills of my companion are quickly becoming legendary among the Shado-Pan.}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Indeed. We must get you two back to safety. Thanks to you, the Thunder King is now completely under siege.}}

Follow Taoshi and interact with the portal to end the scenario and return to the [[Violet Rise]]. Speak with Jaina to turn in.
