==Objectives==
Kill 5 Raptors and 10 Trained Compies in the [[Beast Pens]].
*Raptor slain (5)
*[[Trained Compy]] slain (10)

==Description==
The raptors and compies of the Zandalari represent a substantial threat to our forces here. They are superb hunting beasts that can track prey over great distances and are often lethal to encounter when caught unawares.

I need you to head into the Beast Pens and cull their numbers. We need to make sure to slay them before they are fully trained.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Say what you will about the Zandalari but none can contest their ability to turn even the most repellant of creatures into a trained weapon.

==Completion==
We lost three good soldiers when we first arrived on this island. Killed in their sleep by compies that had snuck into their tent. Some nights I still hear the screams.
