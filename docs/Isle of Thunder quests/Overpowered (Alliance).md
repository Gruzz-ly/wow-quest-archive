==Objectives==
Destroy 7 Sunreaver Mana Collectors around [[Dawnseeker Promontory]].
*Sunreaver Mana Collectors destroyed (7)
*[[Kirin Tor Mana Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
The Sunreaver forces have grown more powerful recently. I suspect magic to be at play here, but I can't be certain.

I think it would be wise to investigate their camp to see if you can find the source of this extra power.

Once you find it, use this crystal to overload and destroy it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|a-hp=75|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 XP
* +150 reputation with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Did you find the source of their extra power?

==Completion==
So they've constructed objects that infuse their forces with additional power? This will have to be watched closely.

Thank you for your efforts today.

==Notes==
Two [[Sunreaver Mana Wyrm]]s are flying next to each Sunreaver Mana Collector in the [[Wildvine Marsh]] and [[Dawnseeker Promontory]]. Kill the wyrms and then use the provided [[Kirin Tor Mana Crystal]] to destroy the mana collector.
