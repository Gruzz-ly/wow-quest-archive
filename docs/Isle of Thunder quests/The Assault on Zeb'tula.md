*Speak to [[Lor'themar Theron]]
*Complete the Assault on [[Zeb'tula]]

== Description ==
Our scouting efforts along the coast have given us valuable intelligence about the island, <class>.

However, we will accomplish nothing if we do not advance forward onto the mainland.

I have assembled a team of our most elite aerial units to begin the attack.

I would like you to join the assault. A champion such as yourself could turn the battle in our favor at the critical moment.

When you are ready to begin the attack, speak to me.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
We must claim a better strategic position on the island itself.

== Completion ==
Yes! You have done it, champion!

We will be as a tide that sweeps over this island, bringing with it a new destiny for our people. And you, hero, are at its forefront.

== Notes ==
Speak with Lor'themar again:
:{{gossip|I am ready! [Queue for solo instance.]}}
This will put the adventurer in the queue for the solo scenario Assault on Zeb'tula.

===Stage 1: Rendezvous with Scout Captain Elsia===
:''Mount the Sunreaver Bloodhawk and fly with Ranger Scout Captain Elsia over the island.''

Lor'themar immediately starts the event:
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|I have selected a landing site for our forces: a small peninsula to our east that is easily defended.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Alas, the Zandalari trolls have already claimed and fortified it.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|They're protecting it with a powerful spirit barrier. We will need to disable it before our ships can land.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Champion, I need you to lead a ground assault and take down that barrier from within!}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Mount up and rendezvous with Scout Captain Elsia. She is organizing an elite group of rangers to accompany you. May the light of the sun shine upon you.}}

Hop on the Hawk that Lor'themar is standing next to.
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Up here, champion!}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|The Sunreavers have devised a way to ward our flying mounts against the lightning. But fly in loose formation, just in case.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Look below! Our continued assaults on the town and crypts have thrown the enemy into disarray. The mogu and the Zandalari already fear the might of the Horde.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Do you see the [[Diremoor|central tower]]? Lightning strikes it continuously. Aethas suspects that the storms originate from the heart of the palace itself.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|The Thunder King's palace lies ahead. We must secure a foothold on the island before we can assault his fortress.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|The other rangers are waiting for us just ahead. Our first priority is - Look out!}}
:''Lightning strikes start knocking the other riders out of the sky.''
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|By the sunwell! The skies betray us - we are not safe up here!}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Down! Everyone down!}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Ugh! Hold on!}}
:''The strikes finally hit Elsia's and the adventurer's mounts.''
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Champion, are you alright?}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|We were not safe at all. They were waiting for us. Our forces are scattered throughout the swamp, and we are alone behind enemy lines!}}

===Stage 2: Ambush===
:{{text|say|Arcanital Mara'kah|They come! To arms me brothers - hurl them back to the sea!}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|No. Not good.}}

Two [[Shaol'mara Beastcaller]]s and four [[Shaol'mara Raptor]]s move in for the ambush. Finish them off.
:{{text|say|Arcanital Mara'kah|You have not seen the full might o' the Zandalari!}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|They are pulling back, but we cannot let up now.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Our only hope of getting out of here alive is to take the town.}}

===Stage 3: Destroy the Barricades===
*Destroy the Barricades and its defenders
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|The entrance is barricaded. Break it down!}}
:{{text|say|Arcanital Mara'kah|Hold the ruins. Slay them where they stand!}}

Two [[Zeb'tula Stoneshield]]s, three [[Zandalari Barricade]]s and three [[Zeb'tula Spearanger]]s block the path. Destroy them all.
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Good work, hero. Let's move on.}}

===Stage 4: Kill Kresh the Ripper===
*Kill Kresh the Ripper
:{{text|say|Arcanital Mara'kah|Crush the intruders. The barrier must not fall.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|I do not like the look of that troll. Be careful!}}

:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|You make this look easy.}}

===Final Stage: Kill Arcanital Mara'kah and his Spirit Mask===
*Kill Arcanital Tula'chek
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|They are protecting that mask. It must be the source of the barrier. Destroy it!}}
:{{text|say|Arcanital Mara'kah|Face me now! My will is iron. My people, unbreakable!}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Destroy the spirit mask to bring down the barrier!}}

Marakah is a Zandalari troll with 2.7 million health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Arcanital's Spark|Strike an enemy with the power of the heavens, dealing 10,335 to 10,865 Holy damage.|notes=1.83 sec cast. Interruptible|range=30}}
*{{abilities|Arcanital's Barrier|range=20|notes=Instant. Summons a barrier that lasts roughly a minute, reducing damage taken by 50% and removing all silence effects.}}
*{{abilities|Waves of Light|range=300|Inflicts 103,040 to 107,016 Holy damage to enemy players in its path.|notes=2.75 sec cast. Uninterruptible. Hits in a ~8-yard-wide path that extends a long distance from Maraki's position.}}

Additionally, the untargetable Spirit Mask has two abilities:
*{{abilities|Spirit Gaze|Inflicts 4,875 to 5,125 Holy damage to enemies within 2 yards of the point of focus.|notes=Instant.}}
*{{abilities|Hymn of Silence|range=20|notes=1.38 sec cast. Silences units for 10 seconds and ticks for ~52K Holy damage}}

Try to stay in one of the '''Arcanital's Barriers''' he spawns, but keep Mara'kah out of it, as it will limit the damage he takes as well. Try to interrupt his '''Arcanital's Spark''' ability and sidestep out of '''Waves of Light'''. Make sure to get under a shield when the spirit mask winds up a '''Hymn of Silence''', which is cast every 30-40 seconds. There is a Devil's Blood Potion on the altar behind him, and there is another inside the big tent.

Finish him off.
:{{text|say|Arcanital Mar'kah|Zandalar...}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|The shield - it is down! We did it!}}
:''A large portal from Silvermoon appears at the top of the steps and many members of the Sunreaver Onslaught teleport through it.''
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Champion, without your help I would've died in that swamp. I owe you my very life.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Victory to the Sin'dorei! And another triumph for the Horde.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|[[Rommath]], establish a perimeter. [[Aethas]], begin placing the sentry wards. [[Kethiel Sunlance|Kethiel]], unload the shelters and supplies.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Brothers and sisters of the Horde! Enemies surround us on all sides! Your courage in weeks to come will be the difference between victory and defeat.}}

===Wrap-up===
Leave the instance and turn in to Lor'themar.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Champion, you have brought glory to the Horde. Your unshakable will has secured our position here. Now, the true work begins.}}
This completes the "Build a Base" portion of [[Isle of Thunder (achievement)]].

Immediately behind Lor'themar's new position on the [[Dawnseeker Promontory]] is an [[Assignment Map]], which starts the day's round of questing by offering a choice for daily questing, PvE or PvP. See the Assignment Map article for more information.
