Disrupt the [[Ancient Stone Conqueror]] ritual in the [[Hall of the Grand Imperion|main temple]] at the [[Court of Bones (Isle of Thunder)|Court of Bones]].
*Disrupt the Ancient Stone Conqueror ritual {{co|35|65|Isle of Thunder}}

==Description==
In the Court of Bones, the Thunder King's sorcerers perform dark rituals.

To bolster their numbers, the Shan'ze soulrippers are imbuing ancient stone statues with stolen spirits from the living. After these stone conquerors are brought to life, they will be formidable opponents on the battlefield.

We must stop their ritual before these statues can be revived.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
It is a mystery how the mogu can imbue life into inanimate stone, but with enough study, we, woo, may one day be able to understand that power.

==Completion==
A good defense is just as effective as a strong offense. One less enemy to worry about.

Well done.

==Notes==
Get to the southern end of the [[Court of Bones (Isle of Thunder)|Court of Bones]] and enter the southernmost building, the [[Hall of the Grand Imperion]]. Kill the four soul-stealers.
