==Objectives==
[[File:Risen Ancestor.jpg|thumb|[[Risen Ancestor]].]]
Kill 15 Risen Ancestors.
*[[Risen Ancestor]] slain (15)

==Description==
Have you seen the ghosts wandering [[Court of Bones (Isle of Thunder)|the graveyard]]?

They are risen ancestors, the spirits of slain mogu who have been called back to this world.

When angered, they attack swiftly and silently, and their numbers increase by the day.

They do not belong here. Destroy them, and send them back beyond the grave.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
How is the situation at the graveyard?

==Completion==
Wonderful work, <class>. This will help our offensive a great deal.

==Notes==
Risen Ancestors move around in groups of three-four. A well-placed AoE will quickly take them out.
