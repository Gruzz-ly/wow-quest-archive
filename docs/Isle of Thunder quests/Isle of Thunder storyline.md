# Isle of Thunder storyline

{{shortcut|itquest}}
[[File:VZ-Isle of Thunder-t1.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''[[Isle of Thunder]] storyline''' plays out in stages during the [[Mists of Pandaria campaign]], tracked via the quest achievement [[Isle of Thunder (achievement)]]. Much like during the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] to retake the [[Isle of Quel'Danas]] back in [[patch 2.4]], completing daily quests will unlock realm-wide progress on the Isle of Thunder, gaining access to different parts of the isle.

==Progression==
The player needs to do all the available "phase progression" scenarios before being able to do daily quests.

The progression is tracked in the achievement [[Isle of Thunder (achievement)]]

===First Landing===
The initial stage of progression is merely getting to the Isle of Thunder itself. There are several one-time quests that start comprise this stage:

#[[Thunder Calls]]
#[[The Storm Gathers]]
#[[Allies in the Shadows]]

===Build a Base===

Immediately after making it to the isle, the first real stage of the storyline is building a more permanent base rather than living on ''[[Crimson Treader|The Crimson Treader]]'' and ''[[Seabolt|The Seabolt]]''. Daily quests taking place in [[Court of Bones (Isle of Thunder)|Court of Bones]], [[Ihgaluk Crag]], and [[Zeb'tula]] are then used to advance the realm-wide stage.

Adventurers will be offered eleven quests from three hubs, followed by a boss-killing quest:

</li></ul>

Once enough realm-wide progress has been made, leaders will offer the quests [[The Assault on Shaol'mara]] or [[The Assault on Zeb'tula]], which play out in single-player scenarios. Upon completing the scenarios and quests, the next stage will begin.

===Break Down the Wall===
[[File:Tear Down This Wall 2 - Jaina and Vereesa beneath Conqueror's Terrace.jpg|thumb|Jaina and Vereesa beneath the Conqueror's Terrace with War-God Al'chukla looking down on them]]

After assaulting Shaol'mara and Zeb'tula, phasing in the [[Violet Rise]] and the [[Dawnseeker Promontory]] respectively, the leaders' focus turns to opening the [[Emperor's Gate]] and tearing down the wall blocking access to the [[Beast Pens]] and [[Conqueror's Terrace]], the first level of Lei Shen's citadel.

The [[Assignment Map]] is made available in this stage and all subsequent stages, providing adventurers the option of completing PvE- or [[#PvP option|PvP-based]] quests for the day. If the PvE option is chosen, daily quests in the previous three areas in addition to the [[Diremoor]] are then used to advance the realm-wide stage.

Eleven quests from the three Stage 1 areas and the Diremoor are offered, followed by a Stage 1 boss quest. For the sake of brevity, only the newly-available quests are listed here:

'''[[Diremoor]]'''
* [[A Wing to Fly On]]
* [[Enemies Beneath the Tower]]
* [[The Shuddering Moor]]
* [[The Sleepless Legion]]
* [[The Zandalari Colossus]]

Once enough progress has been made, players can choose to start the next stage by completing [[Tear Down This Wall! (quest)]], which plays out in a single player scenario.

===Take the Forge===

After tearing down the wall, new quests open up in the [[Beast Pens]] and [[Conqueror's Terrace]], which are then used to progress toward the [[Lightning Vein Mine]] and the [[Thunder Forges]]. The weekly quest [[The Crumbled Chamberlain]] is now available as well.

Adventurers are first offered eight quests from Stage 1-2 areas, and are then offered three quests from one Stage 3 area, followed by a Stage 3 boss quest. As before, only the newly-available quests are listed here:

The end of this stage plays out in [[To the Skies!]], the third single-player scenario.

===Assault the Shipyard===
[[File:A Bold Idea 1 - Taoshi and Thunderwing.jpg|thumb|Taoshi and Thunderwing looking on Stormsea Landing]]

The next step is progressing toward the [[Stormsea Landing]], north of the Conqueror's Terrace and east of the Thunder Forges:

After completing six quests from Stages 1/2 (plus one Stage 1 boss), then three quests from one Stage 3 hub, adventurers will be sent to the Lighting Vein Mines: 

'''[[Lightning Vein Mine]]'''
#One of:
#*[[Maximum Capacitor]]
#*[[On Her Magic-ey Secret Service]]
#*[[Save Our Scouts!]]
#[[Forge Ahead!]]

[[A Bold Idea]] and [[Decisive Action]] will end this stage.

===The Fall of Shan Bu===

The final stage is gaining access to the [[Foot of Lei Shen]] in the center of the citadel, which is the doorstep to the [[Throne of Thunder]], Lei Shen's seat of power.

After completing the Stage 4 daily quests, Taoshi offers one last quest for the day:

'''[[Stormsea Landing]]'''
* [[Extended Shore Leave]]
* [[Raiding the Vault]]

The end of this stage plays out in [[The Fall of Shan Bu]].

===PvP option===
