==Objectives==
Recover a Charged Moganite and bring it to [[Warmage Yurias]].
*[[Charged Moganite]] returned to [[Violet Rise]]

==Description==
We have been dispatching spies into the Sunreaver [[Dawnseeker Promontory|base of operations]] on a daily basis. Some had orders to recover charged moganite from the enemy and bring it here.

They have not returned, and I can confirm they have left the Sunreaver base.

Search the jungle between here and there and find any of the charged moganite that might have been lost in transit. Bring it to me and we will put it to good use.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40|lcgf=2}}
*13,700 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
We can use these charged crystals to power our defenses.

==Completion==
Well done, champion. This artifact will be put to better use in our hands than in the hands of the Sunreavers.

==Notes==
All over the [[Diremoor]] are [[Dead Spy|dead spies]] of either faction, each with a blue moganite crystal near their corpse, which is indicated by a floating gear icon and a mark on the minimap. Interact with the crystal to pick it up. While carrying the moganite, it grants a buff:
:{{Abilities|Charged Moganite|Your attacks have a chance to call down lightning on your opponent. Dying will drop the charged moganite.|icon=inv misc gem crystalcut 01|id=137257}}

Upon delivery, Warmage Yurias may say one of the following:
:{{text|say|Warmage Yurias|Excellent! Can you feel the power of this crystal? I can almost feel my hair standing on end.}}
:{{text|say|Warmage Yurias|A powerful gem.}}
:{{text|say|Warmage Yurias|Mmm. This is a good crystal. You have done well, <name>.}}

Delivering the crystal will also remove Charged Moganite and replace it with a temporary buff:
:{{Abilities|Essence of Moganite|Your recent exposure to moganite has increased your run speed by 5% while on the Isle of Thunder.|notes=15 minute duration.|icon=inv datacrystal05|id=137262}}
