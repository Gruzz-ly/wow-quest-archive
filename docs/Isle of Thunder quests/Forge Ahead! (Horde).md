[[File:Fleshcrafter Hoku.jpg|thumb|[[Fleshcrafter Hoku]].]]
Kill the Master of the Forge and collect a Codex Fragment from [[Fleshcrafter Hoku]] in the [[Isle of Thunder]].
*[[Itoka]] slain
*[[Mogu Codex Fragment]]

==Description==
There's more you must do. Kill Itoka, master of the forge, and find a codex fragment from Fleshcrafter Hoku, gatekeeper of the Thunder King.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Sunreaver Bounty]] and {{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=5}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Well?

==Completion==
Good work. What you did today brings us one step closer to our ultimate goal.

==Notes==
[[Itoka]] is immediately up the hill to the northeast from where [[Metal Lord Mono-Han]] was. A level-90 mogu with 4 million health, Itoka has some very annoying abilities. See his article for tactics on defeating him.

Immediately southeast of Itoka is [[Fleshcrafter Hoku]], a level 90 mogu with 4.7 million health. Kill him for the [[Mogu Codex Fragment]], then head to the [[Bloodied Crossing]] to find [[Scout Captain Daelin]] near the gate to the [[Stormsea Landing]].

If adventurers have gained access to the Stormsea Landing, Taoshi will offer followup quests.
