==Objectives==
Destroy 6 Sunreaver Perimeter Wards around [[Dawnseeker Promontory]].
*Destroy [[Sunreaver Perimeter Ward]]s (6)

==Description==
Even the strongest defense can still have a weakness, <class>. We just need to find the weakness in the Sunreaver's defense and then exploit it as much as possible.

Scouts have reported the use of perimeter wards around Dawnseeker Promontory. They're powerful, but not deadly.

Disabling them would allow us to keep closer watch on their activities.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|40|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
How many wards did you disable?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <race>! I was able to get a few of my scouts behind their lines before the perimeter wards were repaired.

==Notes==
Much like with the [[Kirin Tor Perimeter Ward]]s guarding the [[Violet Rise]], there are equivalent [[Sunreaver Perimeter Ward]]s guarding the [[Dawnseeker Promontory]] and [[Wildvine Marsh]]. Interact with the red gem beneath the icon to disable it.
