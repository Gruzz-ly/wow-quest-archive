==Objectives==
Slay 2 Harbingers of the Loa.
*Harbingers of the Loa slain (2)

==Description==
Have you heard of the [[loa]]? We do not understand all of what it is, but it seems to be a dark magic with some degree of sentience.

We do not know what power the loa might possess, but I must ask you to put a stop to their rituals, <class>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
These stygian rites must end if we are to gain the upper hand, <race>.

==Completion==
I can only imagine what horrors you witnessed, <name>. Your bravery was put to the test this day, and you did not fail the Horde in your task.

==Notes==
Kill [[Zandalari Speaker]], [[Zandalari Arcanital (Isle of Thunder)|Zandalari Arcanital]], or [[Zandalari Spiritweaver]].

==Progression==
