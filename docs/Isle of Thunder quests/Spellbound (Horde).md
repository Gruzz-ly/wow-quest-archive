==Objectives==
Retrieve Jaina's Weathered Spellbook from [[Violet Rise]].
*[[Jaina's Weathered Spellbook]]

==Description==
Jaina possesses several very powerful magic artifacts. These items travel with her at all times, and are never far from her grasp. I have an interest in one of these items.

A tome, filled with knowledge, passed from one archmage to another. I have only ever seen glimpses of it.

Now that we fight on opposite sides I see no issue in removing the tome from her possession.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|h-hp=75|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Do you have it? Do you have the book?! 

==Completion==
I have desired this book for many years, <race>. It's{{sic}} power is too immense to describe. You have done me a great service.
