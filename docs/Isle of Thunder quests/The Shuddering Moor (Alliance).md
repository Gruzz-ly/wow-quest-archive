==Objectives==
Kill the Mighty Devilsaur.
*[[Mighty Devilsaur]] slain

==Description==
There is an immense beast in the swamp. It has not yet marched upon us, but I place no stock that we will continue to be so fortunate.

Strike it down before it grows hungry enough to brave our defenses.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
I still feel the ground shake with its footsteps. Your task is not yet done.

==Completion==
You are not one to be trifled with. I am sure to have further use of your services.

Come back to me in a day's time, <class>.

==Notes==
The [[Mighty Devilsaur]] paths from {{co|47.0|47.4|Isle of Thunder}} to {{co|53.3|59.2|Isle of Thunder}} along the northern road of the Diremoor. A level-90 elite devilsaur, it has 4.7 million health. See it's article for abilities and tactics.

Much like with the [[Zandalari Colossus]] wandering about the southern road of the Diremoor, it is entirely possible to kill the devilsaur without taking any damage whatsoever, simply by getting out of the areas of effect.

==Progression==
