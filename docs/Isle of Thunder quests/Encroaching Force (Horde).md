==Objectives==
Kill Nurkala, the Zandalari [[War Leader]].
*[[Nurkala]] slain

==Description==
My [[scout]]s have spotted a Zandalari war party on the northern beach. I need someone capable to see him dispatched. Are you up to the task?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Sunreaver Bounty]] and {{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=5}}
*294000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Is it done?

==Completion==
You have our gratitude, <name>.

==Notes==
Immediately north of the [[Violet Rise]] on the beach east of [[Conqueror's Terrace]] is [[Nurkala]] and his war party of a [[Zandalari Firespear]], a [[Zandalari Frostspear]], a [[Zandalari Prophet]], and a [[Zandalari Fleshrender]]. All of the trolls have ~2 million health, except for the prophet who only has one million. See [[Nurkala]]'s article for more details, but in short: the firespear and the frostspear only cast their area-of-effect ability and the prophet will chain-cast a heal. Burst down the prophet, then work on Nurkala while getting out of the two areas of effect.
