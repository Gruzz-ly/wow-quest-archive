==Objectives==
Find [[Scout Captain Elsia]] at the [[Beast Pens]].
*Find Scout Captain Elsia at the Beast Pens

==Description==
We need to counter the beasts the [[Zandalari]] are using to strike at our camp. I have dispatched Scout Captain Elsia to the Beast Pens along with some war mages to provide cover.

Go and find her east of here near the breaches in the wall and help her trim down the cavalry and siege beasts being levied against us.

They are masked, so look for the shimmers of their magical cloaking spells.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|96}}
*59000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I'm glad you were the one [[Lor'themar]] sent. These beasts are more than we can handle on our own. Time to spook the livestock.
