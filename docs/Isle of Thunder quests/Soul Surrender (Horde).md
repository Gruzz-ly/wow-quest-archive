Save 6 Sunreaver Scouts or Silver Covenant Scouts.
*Scouts rescued (6)

==Description==
We assault the mogu at the [[Court of Bones (Isle of Thunder)|Court of Bones]], but I fear we merely send them fodder for their abominable rituals.

The mogu do not merely kill their prisoners - they steal their souls and imbue them in machinations of stone, or reforge the fallen into ghostly tools of war.

Horde or Alliance, it matters not. We cannot allow the mogu to bolster their numbers.

Go into the crypts. Free any prisoners that are still living.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
The mogu will steal the very souls from the living. I will not allow this atrocity to continue!

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. You have lightened my heart of a heavy burden through your heroic actions.

I will remember your efforts on this day.

==Notes==
At the Court of Bones, look for scouts of ''either'' faction that are being actively channeled by [[Shan'ze Soulripper]]s and aggro the soulripper. There are also scouts in cages that can be freed.
