==Objectives==
[[File:Kirin Tor Captive.jpg|thumb|[[Kirin Tor Captive]].]]
Free 5 Kirin Tor Captives near [[Dawnseeker Promontory]].
*Free [[Kirin Tor Captive]]s (5)

==Description==
The [[Sunreavers]] will stoop to even the lowest levels to get what they want, <name>.

I received reports earlier that several [[Kirin Tor]] have gone missing. I suspect the Sunreavers may have something to do with this.

Hopefully they have not been harmed, or my wrath will be swift and terrible. I trust you to bring them back in one piece, but please hurry.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Magic runes to hold them captive? That is despicable!

==Completion==
You have saved many today, <name>. I cannot imagine the horror of being frozen and helpless among so many enemies.

==Notes==
[[Kirin Tor Captive]]s are trapped in red runes all over [[Wildvine Marsh]] and the [[Dawnseeker Promontory]]. Interact with the red rune to free the captive:
*{{text|say|Kirin Tor Captive|Thank you.}}
*{{text|say|Kirin Tor Captive|I owe you my life.}}

*Although the captives can be freed while mounted, players should note that doing so will cause the Rune Trap to not vanish and thus not respawn with a new captive for others that seek to preform the quest.
