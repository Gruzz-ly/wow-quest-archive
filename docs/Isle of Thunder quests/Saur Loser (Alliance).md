==Objectives==
Defeat 10 [[Zandalari]] trolls in the [[Beast Pens]].
*Beast Pens Trolls slain (10)

==Description==
Inside the Beast Pens you will encounter some of the most skilled beast tamers in the Zandalari military. They are trained to kill with axe, beast, and claw. This is where they build their cavalry.

We need you to kill any Zandalari you find in the Bestiary before they can get their mounted monstrosities out into the open battlefield.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Good luck.

==Completion==
These trolls have been using dark magics to achieve their goals. No patience, no honor. You have done the world a good service in reducing their numbers today.

==Notes==
Any troll counts, except for the [[Loa Speaker (Isle of Thunder)|Loa Speaker]]s. Go nuts.
