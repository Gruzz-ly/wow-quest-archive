==Objectives==
Defeat a Loa Speaker.
*[[Loa Speaker (Isle of Thunder)|Loa Speaker]] slain

==Description==
The [[Zandalari]] have found a way to bind loa to their beasts giving them impressive and lethal powers.

We need to put a stop to this.

Search the [[Beast Pens]] for a loa speaker and slay him. You should be able to find them by keeping a look out for their glowing beasts.

We must not allow these atrocities to continue.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
I always believed the loa to be a simple troll superstition. These Zandalari are full of surprises.

==Completion==
Well done, champion. These beasts are strong enough. We don't need them infused with an angry spirit now, do we?

==Notes==
There are three [[Loa Speaker (Isle of Thunder)|Loa Speaker]]s in the Beast Pens:
*Three [[Loa-Infused Compy|Loa-Infused Compies]] at {{co|50.0|44.1|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*A [[Loa-Infused Bladetalon]] at {{co|53.2|44.3|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*A [[Loa-Infused Bloodhorn]] at {{co|52.1|36.5|Isle of Thunder||1}}
Each of the speaker-and-beast encounters has it's own set of tactics -- see the three beast articles for more information.
