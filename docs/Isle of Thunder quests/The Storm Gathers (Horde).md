== Objectives ==
Travel with [[Scout Captain Elsia]] to the [[Isle of Thunder]].
*Speak with Elsia
*Isle of Thunder discovered

== Description ==
There is no time to waste, <name>. Every moment we delay here gives [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]] and the [[Kirin Tor]] more of a hold on the Isle.

[[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]] awaits us. Speak to me when you are ready to depart. I will escort you there myself.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
{{cost|4|96}}
* 59000 [[XP]]
*[[Sunreaver Beacon]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

== Completion ==
You have arrived just in time, <race>. It is crucial we gain control of these shores before the Kirin Tor.

There is much to explain.

== Notes ==
Speak with her again:
:There is no time to waste. The Alliance move on the Isle of Thunder as we speak!
:{{gossip|I'm ready to go.}}
:''Elsia and the adventurer mount up on dragonhawks and start flying north.''
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|[[Pandaren]] legends tell of [[Lei Shen]], "The Thunder King." He was the brutal founder of the Mogu empire over 12,000 years ago.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|He united the mogu, defeated the other pandaren races, and founded a glorious nation with the slave labor of those he conquered.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|The Thunder King built a palatial fortress on the borders of his empire. We should see it soon...}}
:''A loading screen appears, and on the other side of it, Elsia and the adventurer have reached the southern side of the Isle of Thunder, south of [[Za'Tual]].''
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|There! Just ahead: the Isle of the Thunder King.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|The pandaren are terrified that the former Emperor will try to reclaim his empire, and enslave them once again.}}
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|But we have our own reasons for assisting them. I will allow Lor'themar to explain.}}
:''A lightning bolt strikes the water yards away from Elsia.''
:{{text|say|Scout Captain Elsia|Whoa! Careful - it is nearly impossible to fly anywhere near the island!}}
:''Elsia and the adventurer land on deck of ''[[Crimson Treader|The Crimson Treader]]'', one of three [[Sunreaver Onslaught]] ships in [[Greymist Firth]].''
Speak with [[Lor'themar Theron]] to continue.

On completion:
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Aethas, leave us for a moment.}}
:''[[Aethas Sunreaver]] teleports away.''
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Hero, you have served the Horde nobly across many campaigns. I feel I can take you into confidence.}}
:''Lor'themar steps over to the port side of the ship.''
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Our Warchief's campaign across Kalimdor and Pandaria is pulling the Horde apart at the seams.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|We are here to fight the Thunder King. Justice demands it, and [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]] is too preoccupied at [[Domination Point]] to pay attention here.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|But, in defeating him, we must seek out the source of his great power. We must claim it for ourselves, as leverage against our "Warchief."}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|In the event of an uprising, we must be prepared.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Heads up!}}
:''Lor'themar shots down a Zandalari.''
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Ha-hah! It will feel good to bloody my blade again. Against Alliance or mogu, does not matter to me.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Enough talk. You know how precarious our position is. Between the Alliance and the Thunder King, only with the help of heroes like you can we hope to succeed here.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Anar'alah belore, hero. Good luck.}}

This completes the "First Landing" criterion of the [[Isle of Thunder (achievement)]] quest achievement.
