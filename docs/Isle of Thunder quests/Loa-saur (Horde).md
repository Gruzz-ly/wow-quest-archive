==Objectives==
Defeat a Loa Speaker.
*[[Loa Speaker (Isle of Thunder)|Loa Speaker]] slain

==Description==
The [[Zandalari]] have found a way to bind loa to their beasts giving them impressive and lethal powers.

We need to put a stop to this.

Search the [[Beast Pens]] for a loa speaker and slay him. You should be able to find them by keeping a look out for their glowing beasts.

We must not allow these atrocities to continue.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Completion==
Well done, champion. These beasts are strong enough. We don't need them infused with an angry spirit now do we?
