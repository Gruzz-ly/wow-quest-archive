== Objectives ==
Go to [[Ihgaluk Crag]] and slay a [[Skumblade tribe|Skumblade saurok]].
*Skumblade saurok slain

== Description ==
Ihgaluk Crag is a dangerous place. Luckily, you have the magic of the [[Kirin Tor]] behind you.

I can transform you into a [[saurok]].

I will perform the first half of the illusion on you now. Afterwards, you should go directly to Ihgaluk Crag and slay one of the Skumblade saurok. Once you have done this, I will contact you and complete the second half of the illusion.

== Completion ==
<The voice of [[Archmage Vargoth]] echoes in your mind.>

Are you there yet? Ah, good.

I can complete the second half of the enchantment now. You will soon see your disguise appear. As long as you stay out of combat, the saurok should see you as one of their own.

Good luck!

("Image of Archmage Vargoth: I will transform you to look like a saurok.")

== Notes ==
This is a one-time quest, but make sure to do it before getting to work on the rest of the daily quests at [[Ihgaluk Crag]]!

Reach the entrance to [[Ihgaluk Crag]] and kill any saurok unit, even one of the named mobs, to complete the quest automatically.

On complete, the player casts "Skin of the Saurok" on itself, gaining a saurok disguise, which turns all [[Skumblade tribe]] saurok neutral. The disguise will be shed upon entering combat, and will be automatically regained a few seconds after leaving combat. Hunter pets, warlock demons, and mage water elementals are also affected, becoming basilisks, oozes, carrion grubs, or something else of the sort. Mounts do not work while shapeshifted; instead, jump to leap a huge distance.
