==Description==
I do not want to see another [[Zandalari]] beast rider breach our defenses!

I have dispatched Scout Captain Daelin and some war mages to the Beast Pens northwest of here. Their mission is to infiltrate and harass the Zandalari siege and cavalry units. I want you to join them and lend your expertise.

Keep an eye out for the tell tale shimmer of their magical cloaking spell.

*59000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Today, we hunt the hunters!

==Notes==
Head to the main gate and take a left heading northwest to reach the [[Beast Pens]]. Daelin is marked by a gossip icon on the minimap and his location is surrounded by the pillars of light.
