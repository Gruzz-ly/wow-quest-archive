'''The Fall of Shan Bu''' ends the fifth and final stage of the [[Isle of Thunder storyline]], gaining access to the [[Foot of Lei Shen]] and the world boss [[Nalak]]. [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]] will only offer this quest from her position on the Violet Rise once enough realm-wide progress has been made, irrespective of the individual player's standing with the Kirin Tor Offensive.

Much like with the previous progression quest, [[A Bold Idea]], this quest mostly takes place in a single-player scenario also called "The Fall of Shan Bu". As the scenario can only be completed once, it is documented here and not in a separate article.

==Objectives==
Defeat [[Shan Bu]]
*Speak to [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]]
*Capture the [[Foot of Lei Shen]]

==Description==
[[Lei Shen]] found a clutch of rare storm dragon eggs early in his campaign. One - known as [[Nalak]] - was particularly brutal and killed all of its handlers, so he took it for his own.

Now, Shan Bu, one of Lei Shen's most loyal servants, works to resurrect the dragon.

It is time for us to strike against Shan Bu!

Speak to me when you are ready to launch the assault!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+300 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
The time to defeat Shan Bu is now!

==Completion==
You've done it, <class>! Shan Bu is dead once and for all, and we've learned that Lor'themar may not be all that he seems.

==Notes==
On approach before accept:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Your timing is perfect as always, hero. It is time to kick down the Thunder King's front door.}}
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Speak to me when you are ready to launch the assault!}}
Speak with her again:
:{{gossip|I am ready to launch the assault [Queue for solo instance.]}}

===Stage 1 - Bloodied Crossing===
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 1 - Alliance intro.jpg|thumb|Alliance getting ready to go]]
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 1 - Alliance, Horde, and Shan Bu.jpg|thumb|Alliance, Horde, and Shan Bu]]
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 1 - Taran Zhu and Shan Bu.jpg|thumb|Taran Zhu and Shan Bu]]

:Work with your allies to assault the [[Bloodied Crossing]].
*Speak with your [[Vereesa Windrunner|Assault Leader]] {{co|59.0|43.8|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*Enter the Courtyard
*Zandalari slain x14
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Good, you are here.}}

Step forward and speak with Vereesa:
:Are you prepared, <name>?
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|Lady Proudmoore! Everyone is in position, and [[Shado-Pan]] are inside, but...}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|But what?}}
:{{text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|The [[Horde]] is just across the courtyard.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Of course they are. One problem at a time, Vereesa.}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmooore|Everyone! Advance!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|... and if anyone sees that traitor, [[Aethas Sunreaver]], save that one for me...}}
:''The party marches forward as Vereesa opens the gate. The Horde war party is already set up on the opposite side of the Bloodied Crossing. Suddenly, the gate to the Foot of Lei Shen opens!''
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Taran Zhu! It does not matter how many you array against the Thunder King. Soon all will kneel before him.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|YOU will kneel when you beg for my mercy, monster.}}
:''A squad of [[Zandalari Stoneshield]]s jump down from the wall as the gate closes!''
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|One problem at a time, people. Focus on the Zandalari!}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Ignore the Horde - focus on the Zandalari guarding the door!}}

Let the NPCs get initial aggro on the trolls, then do some damage to all of them, even the trolls attacking the Horde war party. Trolls will keep spawning until the champion has credit for killing 14.

===Stage 2 - Destroy the Gatekeepers===
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 2 - Destroy the Gatekeepers.jpg|thumb|Destroy the gatekeepers]]

:Defeat the Palace Gatekeeprs to unlock the gates
*[[Palace Gatekeeper]] slain x2
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Those statues wield the power of the first emperor. Destroy them!}}

Two [[Palace Gatekeeper]]s, level-90 elite [[terracotta warrior]]s with 1.5 million health each, activate with the following abilities: <!--90 Elite Terracotta warrior Humanoid / Combat / 69510 Bloodied Crossing / 1,575,000 / Killable -->
*{{abilities|Boulder Throw|range=150|Throws a massive boulder.|notes=0.921 sec cast. The missile will trigger...}}
**{{abilities|Boulder Impact|range=150|Throws a massive boulder, dealing 40,500 to 49,500 damage and knocking back any nearby enemies.|notes=Instant. Area of effect marked with a shadow on the ground.}}
*{{abilities|Thundering Slam|range=10|Deals 75,400 to 84,600 Physical damage to all enemies within 15 yards of the impact location.|notes=2.3 sec cast}}
*{{abilities|Crushing Stomp|Crushes nearby enemies, inflicting Physical damage to all enemies in front of the caster.|notes=2.49 sec cast. Hits for ~55K Physical.|cd=8 sec.}}

As before, let the NPCs tank them, but help finish them off.

===Stage 3 - The Foot of Lei Shen===
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 3 - The Foot of Lei Shen.jpg|thumb|The Foot of Lei Shen]]
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 3 - Fending off enemies.jpg|thumb|Fending off enemies]]

:Defeat Shan Bu's Mogu and Zandalari defenders
*Follow Taran Zhu into the courtyard {{co|58.6|39.9|Isle of Thunder||1}}
*Zandalari and Mogu slain x8
:{{text|yell|Vereesa Windruner|Lady Proudmoore - more Zandalari are approaching from the docks.}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|They're trying to flank us. Hold this position!}}
:''The Alliance war party backtracks to the [[Stormsea Landing]] gate as the Horde war party moves back to defend the [[Thunder Forges]].''
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Taoshi, get those doors open.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Champion, with me. We must press forward while your comrades cover the rear.}}

Move forward and reach Taran Zhu's position:
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Shan Bu! Again you try to create a God. When will you learn?}}
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Who needs a God? We have the Thunder King!}}
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Trolls - make yourselves useful. I am almost finished here.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Zandalari reinforcements are coming.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Yalia - we need more healing! Taoshi - cover the rear!}}
:''Taoshi pulls back as a handful of [[Zandalari Stoneshield]]s, [[Shan'ze Electrocutioner]]s and [[Quilen Guardian (Isle of Thunder)|Quilen Guardians]] draw in to attack.''

Finish them off.

===Final Stage - Defeat Shan Bu===
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 4 - Taran Zhu and Shan Bu.jpg|thumb|Taran Zhu and Shan Bu]]
[[File:The Fall of Shan Bu 4 - Shan Bu choking Taran Zhu.jpg|thumb|Shan Bu choking Taran Zhu]]

:Assaist Taran Zhu and Yalia in bringing down Shan Bu.
*[[Shan Bu]] slain
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Arise, Nalak! Protect our beloved emperor.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Face me, Shan Bu! Or is the court of the Thunder King a den of cowards?}}
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|The emperor will be most pleased when I present him with your head, Shado-Pan.}}
:{{text|yell|Nalak|I am born of thunder!}}
:''Nalak files up and away as Shan Bu begins his attack.''
Shan Bu is a boss-level mogu with 3,151,000 health and the following abilities:
*{{abilities|Draw Shadows|Inflicts 75,524 to 83,475 Shadow damage to nearby enemies.|notes=2.76 sec cast. Uninterruptible.}}
*{{abilities|Shadow Crash|range=50|Fires a missle at a random target. When this missile lands, it deals 49,024 to 56,975 Shadow damage to all enemies within 20 yards of that location.|notes=1.84 sec cast. Uninterruptible.|cd=5 sec}}
Shan Bu will also summon two [[Onyx Stormclaw]]s with ~100K health to harry the champion. Additionally, [[Nalak]] will rain down an electrical storm:
*{{abilities|Electrical Storm|Deals 73,537 to 85,463 Nature damage to enemies in the area.|notes=Instant. Area is marked a few seconds beforehand with crackling lightning.}}

Try to stay near Yalia, who has a Divine Renewal aura that will heal for 13-16% of total health every few seconds. That aura will outheal incoming damage from the Shadow Crash and the Electrical Storm. Do take out the summoned Onyx Stormclaws - as they will build up as the fight progresses.

During the fight, Taran Zhu and Shan Bu have a few random yells:
*{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Ours is to rule. Yours is to serve.}}
*{{text|yell|Shan Bu|You are weak. You Shado-Pan scurry through shadows like roaches.}}
*{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Your "Alliance" is all flash, no strength whatsoever.}}
*{{text|yell|Shan Bu|Your cries of pain delight his majesty!}}
*{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Dance around Shan Bu's attacks. We are faster! We are smarter!}}
*{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Keep moving! Avoid the Stone Lord's lightning!}}
*{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Stay close to Yalia's healing, champion!}}
*{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Stay near Yalia so that she may heal you!}}

At around 15% of total health remaining, Shan Bu stops what he is doing and grabs Taran Zhu in a chokehold:
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|I tire of your insolence! I will choke the life from you, impudent slave!}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Auugh - kill him. Quickly!}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Finish him!}}

Finish Shan Bu off:
:{{text|yell|Shan Bu|I ... no... My Emperor! My Emperor, I have failed you!}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|You see? No power of this world can trample the pure of spirit.}}

This completes "The Fall of Shan Bu" portion of [[Isle of Thunder (achievement)]], and thus awards the achievement itself. The scenario keeps going:

:{{text|yell|Taoshi|Lord Zhu! The Alliance - the Horde - all chaos is about to erupt out here!}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Like children.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Taoshi! Hand me my weapon.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|My Lord... you are gravely wounded!}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|My weapon! Champion, with me. I want you to see this.}}
:''Taran Zhu hobbles back to the Bloodied Crossing, where the Alliance and Horde war parties are facing each other down.''
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Hand over the Archmage and I may yet allow you to walk out of here, Lor'themar.}}
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|Proudmoore! You will release my people from the Violet Hold, or I will cut you down myself!}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Your people are legitimate prisoners of war. They orchestrated an attack on Darnassus from MY city-}}
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|The Sunreavers knew NOTHING of Garrosh's raid on Darnassus!}}
:{{text|emote|Aethas Sunreaver shifts uncomfortably.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|ENOUGH!! There will be no more bloodshed today.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|I see now why your Alliance and Horde cannot stop fighting.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|Every reprisal is itself an act of aggression, and every act of aggression triggers immediate reprisal.}}
: ''Jaina and Lor'themar shout over each other.''
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|They have undermined EVERY attempt at peace!}}
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|I must protect my sovereign people.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|SILENCE! YOU must break the cycle.}}
:{{text|yell|Taran Zhu|It ends TODAY. Here. The cycle ends when you, Regent Lord, and you, Lady Proudmoore, turn from one another. And walk. Away.}}
:{{text|emote|Lor'themar narrows his eyes.}}
:{{text|emote|Jaina takes a deep breath.}}
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theorn|Rangers. Lower your weapons.}}
:{{text|yell|Scout Captain Elsia|My Lord!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Very well. We will stand down.}}
:{{text|yell|Vereesa Windrunner|They killed my husband!}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmooore|This won't bring him back.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|But know this, "Blood" Elf: There can be no peace while Hellscream is Warchief of the Horde.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|That is precisely why I wish to conserve our strength today.}}
:{{text|emote|Jaina's expression softens.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Lady.}}
:''Lor'themar bows.''
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Lord.}}
:''Jaina curtsies.''
:{{text|yell|Lor'themar Theron|Gather the wounded. Withdraw to the harbor.}}
:{{text|yell|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Everyone, regroup back at the camp. Our work here is done.}}
:''The two forces turn and walk away.''
:{{text|yell|Taoshi|Lord Zhu!}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Champion, this cease-fire may not last, but remember what you have seen today.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|We must get you back to the monastery.}}
:{{text|say|Taran Zhu|Shan Bu's monstrosity remains at the foot of the palace. It must be stopped before it wreaks havoc across Pandaria.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Yalia, take Lord Zhu to safety.}}
:''Yalia mounts up and drapes Taran Zhu sideways across it, before running in the direction of the Diremoor.''
:{{text|say|Taoshi|Hero, it will be up to you to defeat the Storm Lord Nalak. You will have to marshal a small army!}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|But after what I have seen today, I have faith in you.}}
:{{text|say|Taoshi|It has been a great honor to fight by your side. Thank you.}}

Head back to the [[Stormsea Landing]] gate and interact with the portal to end the scenario. Turn in to Jaina back at her usual spot on the [[Violet Rise]].
