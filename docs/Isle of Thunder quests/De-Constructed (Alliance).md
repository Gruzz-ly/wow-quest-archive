Recover the four stolen Silver Covenant Constructs.
*Recover [[Disabled Silver Covenant Construct|Disabled Construct]] {{co|44.1|81.7|Isle of Thunder}}
*Recover [[Buried Silver Covenant Construct|Buried Construct]] {{co|53.6|91.3|Isle of Thunder}}
*Recover [[Distressed Silver Covenant Construct|Distressed Construct]]

==Description==
[[Saurok]] consistently test our borders, and our constructs usually fend them off. Some constructs, however, have been defeated and dragged back to [[Ihgaluk Crag]].

I want those constructs back. No slithering lizard will steal [[Silver Covenant]] property under my watch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Hmph... saurok.

<Modera spits.>

==Completion==
That's more like it.

Thank you, <class>.

==Notes==
Make sure to complete [[Skin of the Saurok (Alliance)]] for ease of movement in Ihgaluk Crag!

The buried construct is, well, buried up to its neck on the beach. The disabled construct is at the southwest cave entrance. The distressed construct is running in a large circuit around the crag. The malfunctioning construct is by the bonfire in the northwest.
