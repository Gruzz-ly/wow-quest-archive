== Objectives ==
Free the Tormented Skyscreamer.
*[[Tormented Skyscreamer]] freed

== Description ==
The Zandalari treat their skyscreamer pets as little more than scuttling vermin, bending them to their will with violence and torment.

I can hear one writhing in pain at their hands.

Find the tormented skyscreamer within Za'Tual and help it break free of its captors.

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50|lcgf=2}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

== Progress ==
Have you found the skyscreamer?

== Completion ==
It what?! It killed its master? Wonderful. These skyscreamers  have more fight in them than I realized. Thank you for helping free the beast, <race> - it is one less threat to the Horde, and one more for the Zandalari.

== Notes ==
Kill four [[Zandalari Arcweaver]]s.
