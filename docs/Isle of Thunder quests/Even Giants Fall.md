==Objectives==
[[File:Guardian Tak'u.jpg|thumb|[[Guardian Tak'u]].]]
Destroy Guardian Tak'u within [[Conqueror's Terrace]].
*[[Guardian Tak'u]] slain {{co|60.3|54.2|Isle of Thunder}}

==Description==
The [[Zandalari]] worship the [[Loa]]; animal spirits they often call to their aid. They may be trying to bind these spirits into a huge [[golem]]. The outcome would be disastrous.

I've sent ahead a scout to gather more information, but I think this task may require your expertise.

Stop that ritual at all costs!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
*236000 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Kirin Tor Offensive]]

==Progress==
Did you stop the ritual in time?

==Completion==
It's fortunate that you were able to intervene, <class>. Who knows what damage that golem would have caused had he not been stopped.

==Notes==
Immediately southeast of Daelin is [[Guardian Tak'u]] surrounded by four loa priests, each channeling a buff on him. There is also a Silver Covenant Scout stealthed at the entrance to Taku's area from the main path.

Upon damaging one of the priests:
:{{text|say|Silver Covenant Scout|The priests imbue the guardian with their Loas! They must be stopped!}}
:{{text|say|Silver Covenant Scout|The guardian's power grows! Kill them before it is too late!}}
:{{text|say|Silver Covenant Scout|You must hurry!}}
:{{text|say|Silver Covenant Scout|The guardian has awoken! Destroy it!}}

While the priests are alive, Tak'u cannot be interacted with, so quickly kill as many priests as possible before he activates. Dead priests confer no buff, so take a look at the buffs the priests provide and focus on the most annoying one to take it out first. See Taku's article for more information and tactics.
