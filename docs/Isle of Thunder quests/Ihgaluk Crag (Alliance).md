==Objectives==
[[File:Ihgaluk Crag setup 2.jpg|thumb|Modera's other position outside Ihgaluk Crag]]
Find [[Archmage Modera]] outside of [[Ihgaluk Crag]].

==Description==
Archmage Modera has taken over at Ihgaluk Crag, to the southeast, continuing her efforts to turn the [[saurok]] against the [[Zandalari]] and the [[mogu]].

Go to her, and help in any way that you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|96}}
*59000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You have good timing. I am quite in need of your assistance.

==Notes==
Before capturing [[Violet Rise]], Modera's party can be found between [[Ihgaluk Crag]] and [[Za'Tual]], north of the bone-filled area dominated by [[Zur'chaka the Bonecrafter]] and the [[Eternal Spirit of Tharon'ja]]. After claiming the Rise, her party is situated immediately outside of the crag at its southeastern entrance, yards away from the Violet Rise territory.
