==Objectives==
Steal the Choker of Storms from [[Swollen Vault|The Swollen Vault]].
*[[Choker of Storms]]

==Description==
The Swollen Vault is a repository for some of Lei Shen's nastiest weaponry and most prized trinkets - not surprisingly, these are often one and the same.

One artifact in particular, an amulet known as the Choker of Storms, could help us to understand his apparent mastery over lightning.

Break into the vault and slay the [[Lu-Shero|hoard-keeper]]. Take his key and use it to recover the amulet from a cache at the back of the vault.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|45|60|lcgf=2}}
*471000 [[XP]]
*+200 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
You have good news, I hope.

==Completion==
Ah, I know a powerful artifact when I see one. You were wise to bring this here. I will see that Aethas examines it right away + perhaps we can put it to work in our favor.

In the meantime, take this in trade.
