==Objectives==
Use the Attuned Crystal to retrieve the Remnants of the Animus from the [[Dark Animus]] within the [[Throne of Thunder]].
*[[Remnants of the Animus]]
*[[Attuned Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
{{Questportrait|image=DarkAnimus.jpg|name=The Dark Animus}}
Scouts unearthed this strange construct hidden within the Ghostly Veins. A secret weapon of the Thunder King no doubt.

Perhaps, there is a chance we can use this discovery to our benefit. If we can re-animate it, we can study it. More importantly, we can discover its weakness.

Go to the Throne of Thunder and use this crystal to capture whatever essence animates these constructs.

Return to me when the task is complete.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Glorious Standard of the Sunreaver Onslaught]]
*{{cost|19|84|50}}
* 236000 [[XP]]
* +1000 [[reputation]] with [[Sunreaver Onslaught]]

==Progress==
Were you successful in our endeavor?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <class>. This is a dark magic indeed. We have much to learn here if we are to succeed.

Now, we have only to hope that we can reanimate this creature.
