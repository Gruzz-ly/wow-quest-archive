[[File:Cracking His Shell.jpg|thumb|A [[Brimstone Enforcer]] guarding an Aberrus Charge]]

==Objectives==
[[File:Aberrus Charge.jpg|thumb|Aberrus Charge]]

Destroy the conduits generating the shield at the [[Aberrus Approach]].
* Connection destroyed (2) {{co|47.5|16.3|Zaralek Cavern}} {{co|49.1|16.6|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
We have seen shields like this before. [[Scalecommander Sarkareth|Sarkareth]] is drawing on the power of [[Aberrus]] to protect himself while he finds his way in.

Cowardly, but clever.

Disrupt the conduits that are supplying his shield power, and we should be able to reach him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Dark Talons]]
* +50 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]

==Progress==
We must bring that shield down!

==Completion==
Good. Now I have one last chance to reason with him.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|yell|Scalecommander Sarkareth|More! I must have more power!}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I will keep an eye on him while you figure out a way to bring down the shield!}}

Defeat the [[Brimstone Enforcer]] guarding each charge, then interact with the [[Aberrus Charge]] to disable it. On return:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|We must stop him!}}

==Progression==
{{Inevitable Confrontation}}
