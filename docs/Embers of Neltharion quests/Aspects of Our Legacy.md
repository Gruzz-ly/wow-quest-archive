'''Aspects of Our Legacy''' concludes the second chapter of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]], "Sundered Legacy". The next chapter, "The Ancient Bargain", begins immediately after with [[Where There's Smoke, There's Fire]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Ebyssian]] in [[Loamm]].
* Meet Ebyssian in Loamm

==Description==
I am proud to see that [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] is blossoming into a confident leader once more. Her people need her.

But that [[Scalecommander Sarkareth|Sarkareth]] found [[Oathbinder]] is a reminder of the horrors of [[Neltharion]]'s legacy and the folly of following him.

I have a feeling that we will discover more than his trinkets and whispers here in [[Zaralek Cavern|these caverns]].

Come. We have much to discuss. Let us go back to Loamm and see if my brothers have found a way to subdue [[Fyrakk]].

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Endowed Breeches]]
*[[Inherited Leggings]]
*[[Bequeathed Tassets]]
*[[Bestowed Greaves]]

You will also receive:
* [[Shiny Token of Gratitude]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +50 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Completion==
I am... startled by Ebyssian's censure. 

Any objects of power Neltharion was hoarding would have been a boon to us.

But he is right... if I want to be an Aspect, I need to show everyone what power the true heir to the black dragonflight holds.

I will start with Fyrakk.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Ebyssian silently walks out.''

On the way out, Rannan, Tuberros, and Perisimona have set up inside. They all have gossip:
;Rannan Korren: Did you see all of that stuff? All those artifacts?
:It's like a "greatest hits" collection of things I want but don't need.
:Oh yeah... and the Dragonscale Expedition would probably like a report on them too... 
:Now that everything has calmed down, maybe we should come back after we return to Loamm?
:Talk to me then if you're interested!
;Tuberros: I'm so glad you were able to help Emberthal deal with Sarkareth. The Sundered Flame won't be as much of a problem anymore.
:It'll make the area safe for my new venture with my uplander client!
:Yeah! We're going to be partners! There are a couple... things he'd like to get done around here.
:Sell some artifacts, do some experiments... me and my grubnector are going to help him out!
:Be sniffing you later!
;Perisimona: Look at my Tuberros, my snailslime! 
:He is so brave... so brilliant!
:I never thanked you and Emberthal for bringing him back to me with his nose still attached. The both of you are always welcome in my hut for some dustmoth cocoon tea.
:Hope to smell you again around Loamm!

Return to the main building of Loamm, where Sabellian and Wrathion are having another argument. Sabellian has gossip:
:With a full stomach and a clear mind for a fresh perspective, my plan to take out Fyrakk is ready.
:I wish Wrathion would have been less self-centered and more forthcoming to my invitation to join my troops. I even offered him a high-ranked position.
:It is the best outcome for him once I become an aspect.

Speak with Ebyssian:
:From the looks of it, my brothers have not reached an agreement let alone formulated a plan for our next steps against Fyrakk.
:<Ebyssian sighs heavily.>
:I am... frustrated by their childishness.
:{{gossip|You should talk to them.}}

A cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|nG2mU6TyMr8}}
:''Sabellian and Wrathion are having an argument by the main building of [[Loamm]] as [[Ebyssian]], [[Emberthal]], and the champion walk up.''
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Ah, my good friends. What treasures have you brought me?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Ignore him. He has no claim to my father's possessions.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Is that truly the matter at hand?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Who is the rightful heir to a legacy of deceit, control, and fear?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|So you did find something.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|We did. And I destroyed it.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|You had no right!}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I had every right.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|So long as that device existed my people would never be free.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|What has she done?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|While you two bicker like petulant whelps, she did what was right for her people.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Let go of the past.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Your flight needs you here and now.}}
:''Ebyssian walks away, and Emberthal shakes her head before doing the same. Sabellian and Wrathion take a long look at each other as the scene fades to black.''

This concludes the "Sundered Legacy" portion of [[Embers of Neltharion (achievement)]]. Sabellian continues the campaign with [[Where There's Smoke, There's Fire]].
