==Objectives==
Find out why the [[Sundered Flame]] expedition is in [[Zaralek Cavern]].
* Clues found (4)
* [[Sundered Flame Expedition Notes]] (6)

==Description==
It no longer matters how the Sundered Flame got here; now we need to know why. What is in [[Nal ks'kol|this vault]] that [[Scalecommander Sarkareth|Sarkareth]] is after?

<Name>, while you are in [[Sundered Flame Camp|their camp]], look for notes, research papers, journals--anything you can find that might reveal their intentions. Please bring whatever you find to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Endowed Mitts]]
*[[Inherited Gloves]]
*[[Bequeathed Gauntlets]]
*[[Bestowed Crushers]]

You will also receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +50 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Were you able to learn anything yet?

==Completion==
The information in these notes is... troubling, but it does not tell me why Sarkareth is trying to find and enter Aberrus.

The only way to know will be to catch up to him.

==Notes==
Head south into the [[Sundered Flame Camp]]. Defeat [[Sundered Defender|Sundered defenders]], [[Sundered Mender|menders]], and [[Sundered Researcher|researchers]] for their [[Sundered Flame Expedition Notes]]. Look for scrolls and texts, which contain notes:

;Draconic Scroll: {{text|say|Neltharion|The whispers showed me through the veil of lies, and now, I am free. Aberrus will be barred to all but my most trusted subjects, the keys hidden in Nal ks'kol.}}
;Draconic Text: {{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|At last, my research has given me a clue how to reach Aberrus. A nearby titan vault contains a copy of all Neltharion's plans and bases. I must get inside!}}
;Titan Scroll: {{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|The titans abandoned the vault to the south, but father claimed it, naming it Nal ks'kol.}}
;Titan Writings: {{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Can it be? Did father really hide this artifact in Nal ks'kol? I must have it!}}

==Progression==
{{Sundered Legacy}}

==PTR version==
;Completion
We should make haste to Nal ks'kol, the titan vault. According to these notes, Neltharion was using it to store information and perhaps artifacts. 

It is troubling that Sarkareth was looking something there. Does he want access to Aberrus? Why?
