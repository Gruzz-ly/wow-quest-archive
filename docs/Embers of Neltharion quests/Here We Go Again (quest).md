'''Here We Go Again''' begins the fourth chapter of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]], "Inherited Sin". This chapter (and the next) were unlocked the week of May 9, 2023.

==Objectives==
Meet [[Ebyssian]] in [[Zaralek Cavern]].
* Ebyssian found
* Ask [[Kalecgos]] for a Portal (Optional)

==Description==
I understand [[Alexstrasza]]'s concerns. [[Shadowflame]] is a vile force that poses an indescribable threat to anyone who comes close to it, as we have personally witnessed. Unfortunately, [[Aberrus]] may contain even more threats.

We need to continue to push forward.

Before I left Zaralek Cavern, I made contact with soldiers stationed by [[Neltharion]] at the [[Obsidian Rest]]. Luckily for us, they remain loyal to the [[Black dragonflight|Black Dragonflight]].

Let us meet there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am glad you were able to join us, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Come, everyone. There is no time to waste.}}
:{{text|say|[[Wrathion]]|Easy, [[Sabellian]]. You may heal quickly, but the injury you sustained was rather significant.}}
:''Sabellian huffs.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I will be fine.}}
:''They walk southwest, shift to their [[dragon]] forms, and fly off.''

Handily, [[Kalecgos]] can be asked to provide a portal by speaking with him:
:{{gossip|quest=|I need a portal to Zaralek Cavern.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I cannot promise the accuracy of this [[teleportation]] spell, as teleporting to underground locations can be... challenging.}}
:''A portal to Zaralek Cavern appears in front of Kalecgos.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Good luck, <name>.}}

The portal drops players off at {{co|48.7|40.0|Zaralek Cavern}} in the middle of the [[Acidbite Ravine]] roughly 100 yards up!
:{{text|yell|Kalecgos|Not today!}}
:''A Mirror Image of Kalecgos catches the player in an arcane bubble before they {{wp|lithobrake}}.''
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|That was too close, friend.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|I couldn't live with myself if anything happened to you because of a bad teleportation spell.}}
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Now with that being said... I don't think we need to mention this to Alexstrasza, right?}}
:''The mirror image teleports away.''

Catch up with Ebyssian, Sabellian, Wrathion, and two [[Obsidian Scout]]s just southwest of the [[Obsidian Rest]] in northern [[Zaralek Cavern]].

Wrathion has gossip:
:Here we are again in a very unusual environment, <name>.
:But I have a strong feeling that everything will change once we uncover the secrets of Neltharion's legacy.
*{{gossip|Tell me about Aberrus.}}
:A mysterious and foreboding place, hidden away from the rest of the world--and for a good reason. 
:The very walls of the Laboratory seem to whisper with the echoes of dark magic and forbidden knowledge. It is a place of both danger and fascination--one we must explore if we hope to confront our father's legacy head on.
*{{gossip|What about Sabellian?}}
:<Wrathion lowers his voice.>
:You mean our "heir apparent"?
:His wounds seem to heal very quickly. I wouldn't be surprised if he was back to full strength already.
:Sadly, he is still convinced the leadership of the black dragonflight is his right. He is the very personification of the old days... A remnant of the past, if you will.
:And that is why I cannot let him have it. We need to step away from the old ways. I must take the flight forward.

As does Sabellian:
:Nothing should stand in the way of our efforts to get inside the Laboratory. 
:It is of the utmost importance that we succeed in this task.
:{{gossip|How is your wound?}}
:It is fine. It takes a lot more to take me down.
:But I worry what [[Fyrakk|Fyrrak]]'s<!-- is this sic? --> transgression might mean for all of us. Stronger than him have succumbed and lost their way in the [[shadowflame]].

So does Ebyssian:
:Ah, <name>. My thanks again for your timely arrival.
:{{gossip|Why is Aberrus so important?}}
:Aberrus was Neltharion's secret laboratory for many years--even before any of us were born. 
:Many may have different intentions for seeking it, but our primary concern should be ensuring that anything remaining in Aberrus does not end up in the hands of our enemies.
