==Objectives==
Meet [[Elder Honeypelt]] in [[Loamm]].
*Meet Honeypelt on the outskirts of Loamm {{co|58.6|54.6|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
I smelled you weren't a bad sort from the start. A little sweaty, but not a bad sort.

Consider this your personal invitation to Loamm, home of the [[niffen]]!

Let's all meet just outside the entrance. That way I can give you and your pals the proper niffen welcome!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +2,500 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

==Progress==
You got Elder Honeypelt with you somewhere?

Hiding inside your boots, maybe?

==Completion==
Welcome to Loamm, Uplander! Our shining smell of a city!

[[Aurantia]] is the name. I'm the High Redolence around here, which is just a fancy way of saying I'm the leader. It also means I'll be protecting my people from all the trouble that's broken on through from above.

But, you know what? We've got time for all that later! [[Ebyssian]] and [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] have already filled me in, so why not take a second to rest up on a soft patch of dirt?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Mmmm... we'll be eating good tonight. Young man, would you help an elder carry this ton of meat to her wagon just outside the nests?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|It would be my pleasure. Are these deepflayers what your people normally eat?}}
:''Wrathion grabs a chunk of meat as they start walking off.''
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Oh no! The opposite usually. But someone needs to go and fight the horrors that prey on the people of my town.}}
:''The disappear into the distance.''

Head south into Loamm to find Sabellian, Wrathion, and Elder Honeypelt at the eastern entrance:
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Over here!}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|A dead Sundered Flame was in those nests? It never ends, does it.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|The Flame we can handle. What it would seem they are after, perhaps not so much.}}

Speak with Honeypelt:
:You ready for the greatest city under the sunny ground?
:{{gossip|We're ready to enter Loamm.}}
:''Honeypelt starts walking into town.''
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Looks like the uplanders you were waiting for have already settled in with us. Told you the niffen were hospitable!}}

:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|She's back... she's back!}}

Brynnsahce runs up to [[Elder Honeypelt]]

:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Elder Honeypelt! You've returned! Tell me everything!}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Calm down, Brynnsahce. These uplanders got into quite the scrape with that fiery beast we scented earlier. Let's get them settled in, and I'll tell you the tale.}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Of course! Where are my manners? Welcome to Loamm, uplanders!}}

[[File:Smells Like Loamm final.jpg|thumb|The players at Loamm's central building]]
They stop outside the main building in the center of town. Present are [[Brynnsahce]], [[Effervesta]], [[Aurantia]], [[Ebyssian]], [[Scalecommander Emberthal]], [[Wrathion]], and [[Sabellian]]. Most have gossip:
; Brynnsahce: Hey hey, Uplander!
: Let me know if you need anything! I am Elder Honeypelt's number one, after all. 
: I'm not even making it up, either! She told me I was!
; Effervesta: Hi! I'm Effervesta. But you're gonna call me Effie because I'm telling you to, got it?
: Things are getting busy and busier down here in lil Loamm! Plenty of uplanders have come to visit since that tunnel to the top was made. 
: I know there's some extra dangerous types roaming around Zaralek now, but it's all just so smellin' exciting! Ain't it!
; Aurantia: The niffen of Loamm are everything to me.
; Ebyssian: It is lucky that the niffen are such a welcoming and generous people. They have given us a place to recover and plan our next move.
; Scalecommander Emberthal: It is good to see you are well, <name>, if not a little worse for wear.
: That being said, can you believe this? An entire world existing right below us. 
: Fascinating.
;Sabellian: Seeing Ebyssian again after everything we went through...
:It has not been long at all, but there is much we must discuss with each other. I cannot deny a certain amount of shame at our failure to slay Fyrakk. Perhaps it is made worse by the fact that we were not patient enough to wait for his and Emberthal's arrival.
:No matter. Once we have spoken and I have recovered, the Incarnate's days will be numbered.
;Wrathion: Fortune must truly favor us, <name>. I could not imagine better luck than getting a hot bath and a warm meal after fighting through Primalists, Fyrakk, and those dreaded deepflayers.
:I would say we owe a great debt to Honeypelt. Do you not agree?
