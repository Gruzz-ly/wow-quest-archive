==Objectives==
Meet the Keeper of Renown, Renown Quartermaster, and the Flight Master in [[Loamm]].
* [[Mimuup|Keeper of Renown]] {{co|56.5|55.6|Zaralek Cavern}}
* [[Harlowe Marl|Renown Quartermaster]] {{co|56.4|55.6|Zaralek Cavern}}
* [[Avogadro|Flight Master]] {{co|55.6|54.8|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
I'm impressed. [[Elder Honeypelt]] speaks highly of you--and that's rare!

Your friends [[Ebyssian]] and [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] admittedly made similar impressions with us after we caught their scent. They told me of your hunt for [[Fyrakk|the fiery monster]] that's invaded [[Zaralek Cavern|Zaralek]] from the uplands. A worthy reason to become allies.

But we'll need a bit more time to discuss it. Why not take a short break to meet with my people. Trade, leisure, travel--there's no shortage of ways to spend your time here in Loamm!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Smells around every corner, but nothing dangerous!

==Completion==
Zaralek Cavern will not see the end of these new enemies any time soon, so let us continue getting to know each other with open arms and open snouts.

Consider this your official invitation to stay with us here in Loamm, the great city of smells!

==Notes==
After picking up all three quests and speaking with Brynnsahce:
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Woah... You smell completely different to anything I've ever smelled. Even Elder Honeypelt doesn't come back with scents this unexpected.}}
:{{text|say|Aurantia|Why don't we all move to Carrilion Belfry? We're clogging up the streets here.}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Anyway!  I'll be your guide in Loamm.  Let me show you why Elder Honeypelt chose me as her monster hunter apprentice!}}
:''The players all move north.''

[[Mimuup]], the Keeper of Renown is inside the main building:
:Well, hey howdy hey, uplander!
:The dirt around these parts hasn't been so disturbed since our greatmothers burrowed up to found Loamm oh so long ago.
:I won't lie, we'd sure like to get to know you better. All this calamity, it can't be handled unless we work together. 
:Am I right?
:{{text|say|Mimuup|Welcome! Lots 'o uplanders been coming lately. Darn exciting, if you ask me!}}
:{{text|say|Harlowe Marl|Almost as exciting as when we first hired the drogbar to help with guarding the town!}}
:{{text|say|Mimuup|Almost! No need to worry about 'em though, friend. Snails, swallows, and premium crystals keep our two races nice and friendly.}}
:{{text|say|Harlowe Marl|Darn dirtin' right!}}

Mimuup starts [[A Worthy Ally: Loamm Niffen]], a weekly quest.

[[Harlowe Marl]], the quartermaster, is next to Mimuup. Outside to the north, [[Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher]] starts [[Power Unified]].

Northwest of the main building is [[Avogadro]], the flight master:
:{{text|say|Avogadro|Hey howdy, uplander! I'm the main mole when it comes to zoomin' around ten thousand leagues under the sun lands!}}
:{{text|say|Avogadro|Well, maybe not ten thousand...}}

Next to Avogadro is an image of [[Kalecgos]], who starts [[Fyrakk's Forces]] &mdash; the breadcrumb to [[Fyrakk Assaults]] &mdash; and a poster that starts [[TICKET: Glimerogg Games]].

;Description
I'm impressed. [[Elder Honeypelt|Honeypelt]] rarely vouches for anyone, but she speaks highly of you.

Your [[Ebyssian]] has admittedly done the same with us upon his arrival as well. He and [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] arrived shortly before you, but have explained the situation.

I implore you to put our mutual foes to the side, just for a moment. Take a short break to meet with my people. Trade, professions, leisure--there's no shortage of ways to spend your time here in Loamm.
