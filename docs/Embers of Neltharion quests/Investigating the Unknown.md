==Objectives==
Investigate the origins and motivations of the creatures in the area.
* [[Zaqali Berserker|Djaradin corpse]] inspected
* [[Drakonid Poacher|Poacher corpse]] inspected
* Contact made with a [[Slitherdrake (NPC)|slitherdrake]]

==Description==
We can only assume that something ambushed the marching [[djaradin]]. Who could have done this?

We should investigate it before we proceed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
So, the djaradin were stopped here by an unknown [[dragonkin]] force. Judging by how many lie dead, these dragonkin are as brutal as the djaradin.

What worries me the most is that they still carry [[Neltharion]]'s banner, which means they remain loyal to him and whatever task he once gave them.

We must be careful--this has just got more complicated.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Easy, little one. We won't hurt you.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|This one still carries Father's banner.}}

[[Ebyssian]] is looking at the corpse of a [[Zaqali Berserker]]:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Killed by drakonid weapons.}}

[[Sabellian]] is inspecting the corpse of a [[Drakonid Poacher]]:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|It would seem they remain loyal to Neltharion. Could they be coming from Aberrus?}}

[[Wrathion]] is with three [[slitherdrake]]s:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Extraordinary creatures. This area must be their nesting grounds.}}

On complete, Ebyssian has new gossip:
:There is much we do not know about Zaralek Cavern.
:{{gossip|Remind me what this place is?}}
:When the djaradin found this cave, they also discovered the existence of the slitherdrakes.
:After following the djaradin here, we discovered they were ambushed by a dragonkin force unknown to us. According to Sabellian, they carry Neltharion's banner, which probably means they remain loyal to him.
