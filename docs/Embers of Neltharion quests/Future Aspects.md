'''Future Aspects''' begins the second chapter of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]]: "Sundered Legacy".

==Objectives==
Suggest [[Elder Honeypelt|Honeypelt]] as a guide.
* Suggest Honeypelt as a guide
*Meet Ebyssian in the Crystal Fields.

==Description==
My brothers are not interested in investigating the [[Sundered Flame]] or helping [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]]. 

It worries me that we are dividing our efforts, but I understand their motivation in considering our next steps against [[Fyrakk]] immediately.

I will aid Emberthal as I promised, but perhaps we should ask for help from the local [[niffen]]...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
While my brothers investigate and make plans, we should help Emberthal in her pursuit of the Sundered Flame.

==Completion==
Thank you for continuing to aid us, <name>. Emberthal will fill you in on what we have discovered so far.

==Notes==
Speak with Ebyssian again:
:The niffen here in [[Loamm]] all speak of [[Nal ks'kol|this mysterious temple]].
:By its description, [[Sabellian]] and I agree that it is most likely a [[Titan]] vault. 
:We should find a guide and investigate if the Sundered Flame are there.
*{{gossip|We don't need a guide.}}
:Ah, <name>, but we do. 
:This cavern is vast, dangerous, and new to us all. Going out there without proper guidance would be reckless even if we went together.
:{{gossip|A valid point.}}
*{{gossip|We could ask Kalecgos.}}
:With what we have experienced down here, I am... loathe to bring more dragons into the caverns.
:Also enlisting outside help would take time. We need someone more... local.
:{{gossip|A valid point.}}
*{{gossip|We could ask Honeypelt.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|We need a guide to the titan vault, Honeypelt. We believe it has a connection to Aberrus.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Well, my scent hasn't marked that route. You'll need Tuberros to take you there. [[Perisimona]]! Where's your husband?}}
:{{text|say|Perisimona|Oh, Elder Honeypelt... I was just coming to tell you. [[Tuberros]] went to the vault and... he's gone!}}
:{{text|say|Perisimona|He and his uplander client were kidnapped... by the cinder-smelling scale people! Like her!}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|You mean like me? The Sundered Flame must be there! But... why?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|It seems our purposes are aligned once more, Emberthal. Can you take us there, Perisimona?}}
:{{text|say|Perisimona|Anything for my sweet-smelling snailykins. I mean, Tuberros. Follow me and I'll show you where I last saw him!}}
:''Perisimona and Emberthal run off as Ebyssian starts walking.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|And when you get to the vault, remember anything you find is mine by birthright.}}
:''This stops Ebyssian short.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|You're welcome to it. I want nothing from Neltharion.}}
:''Ebyssian resumes walking off.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Honeypelt, I require food and drink to clear my head and strategize. Do you wish to join me?}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Sure thing! I know just the place!}}
:''Sabellian, Honeypelt, and Ebyssian walk off.''

Before walking off, Sabellian has gossip:
:The black dragonflight is battle-tested, which means we may lose a fight, but we will win the war.
:If I don't take out Fyrakk, my reputation as a general and a black dragon will be tarnished. I cannot let that happen.
:{{gossip|What will you do next?}}
:I have to devise a plan. Hopefully, Wrathion will bring back useful information. 
:Until then, you may be more help to Ebyssian and Emberthal.

As does Emberthal:
:Is this what leadership is all about to these two? Who can do it better? I have not seen them in one clear-minded moment where they have thought of anything but their agendas. The Neltharion I knew would have been disappointed. I know I am.
:{{gossip|What do you have in mind?}}
:I am concerned about the dead Sundered Flame that you have found. 
:What are they truly after?

[[File:Future Aspects - Nal Ks'kol.jpg|thumb|Ebyssian, Perisimona, and Emberthal outside Nal ks'kol]]
Catch up with Ebyssian, Emberthal, and Perisimona at the [[Crystal Fields]] outside [[Nal ks'kol]]. Emberthal has new gossip:
:We know that Sarkareth is trying to find traces of Neltharion...
:But what is he looking for?
:Are the Sundered Flame here a reconnaissance team?
