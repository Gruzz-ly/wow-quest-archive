==Objectives==
Collect the shards of [[Sarkareth]]'s signet.
*[[Signet Shard]]s Collected (3)

==Description==
[[Emberthal]] is in mourning. In truth, she has been grieving for Sarkareth for some time now.

The way forward is for her to determine. We can only be there to support her along the way.

There are shards of Sarkareth's signet scattered all over this room. Would you gather them? I believe she would appreciate the gesture.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Emberthal is in no mood to speak just yet.>

==Completion==
<Emberthal looks up as you approach.>

==Notes==
Three signet shards light up in the southwestern portion of the room.

:{{text|say|Emberthal|It is time for the dracthyr to make our own path.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Where do you hope it will lead?}}
:{{text|say|Emberthal|Far from the shadows of the past that have haunted us, and free to build a legacy of our own.}}

:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I am... humbled.}}
