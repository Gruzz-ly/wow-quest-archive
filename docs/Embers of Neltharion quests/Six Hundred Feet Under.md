'''Six Hundred Feet Under''' concludes the "Breaking Ground" chapter of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]]. The second chapter of the campaign, "Sundered Legacy", begins with the direct followup: [[Future Aspects]].

After the first character on the account completes this quest, all other characters have instant access to repeatable content in Zaralek Cavern, such as world quests and public objectives.

==Objectives==
Discuss the next plan of action with [[Ebyssian]].
* Regroup with your companions

==Description==
That was just a taste of the [[niffen]] lifestyle. There's still far more to [[Loamm]] and even more from [[Zaralek Cavern]]. Continue exploring while you pursue [[Fyrakk|the fiery monster]], and let its scents continue to amaze you!

For now, Ebyssian asked that I send you his way. Seems your companions are planning what to do next.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
* {{Abilities|Zaralek Cavern World Quests|Unlocks access to World Quests and other outdoor activities in Zaralek Cavern.|id=408876|icon=ability_evoker_dragonrage2}}

You will also receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
There is much to discuss.

==Completion==
Though I still wish you had waited for [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] and myself to arrive, I do not believe the outcome would have been any different. This Incarnate is more powerful that we anticipated.

There is much to consider.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|emote|Ebyssian waves you over.}}

[[Ebyssian]], [[Scalecommander Emberthal]], [[Wrathion]], and [[Sabellian]] are a few yards away. Check in with Ebyssian:
:Getting familiar with Loamm, <name>? 
:Good. I am beginning to realize we will need the niffen's help if we are to survive down here.
:{{gossip|Let's discuss our next steps.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|The niffen saw an eruption of fire in the cavern you came from. Was that Fyrakk?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|He defeated us as if we were nothing.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|He is surprisingly stealthy. I am sure we can devise an effective strategy if we are not distracted by...}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|The whispers...}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Yes. They distracted us at key moments. They are quieter when I use my visage.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Also, I have discovered some recording artifice of my father's. He talked of a laboratory called Aberrus. A Sundered Flame partisan was killed by one of them.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Neltharion... That must be why Sarkareth is here.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I will go and search for this Aberrus--quietly and alone.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Stay hidden, Wrathion.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Queen Aurantia has spoken of a nearby temple. Could it be connected to Aberrus?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I would ask Elder Honeypelt to guide you. She is quite capable.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Indeed, she saved Sabellian from the deepflayers. You should have heard his cries! Ha!}}
:''Wrathion walks off.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I was able to rescue myself without any assistance whatsoever! Unlike--bah, it is foolish sparring with that whelp!}}

Ebyssian has new gossip:
:It seems our skirmish with Fyrakk has been a blow to us all. I was hoping to proceed with caution, strategy... and unity.

Sabellian has new gossip:
:The black dragonflight is battle-tested, which means we may lose a fight, but we will win the war.
:If I don't take out Fyrakk, my reputation as a general and a black dragon will be tarnished. I cannot let that happen.

Scalecommander Emberthal has new gossip:
:Is this what leadership is all about to these two? Who can do it better? I have not seen them in one clear-minded moment where they have thought of anything but their agendas. The Neltharion I knew would have been disappointed. I know I am.

This concludes the "Breaking Ground" criterion of [[Embers of Neltharion (achievement)]].

Ebyssian starts the direct followup, [[Future Aspects]]. Additionally, [[Elder Honeypelt]] starts [[Slime Time Live]], and [[Effervesta]] starts [[A Swallow's Tale]], both optional. Further in Loamm, [[Examiner Tae'shara Bloodwatcher]] starts [[Power Unified]].
