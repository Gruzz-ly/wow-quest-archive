'''Where There's Smoke, There's Fire''' begins the third chapter of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]], "The Ancient Bargain".

==Objectives==
Meet [[Ebyssian]] and [[Sabellian]] outside the [[Zaqali Caldera]].

==Description==
If you are finished indulging [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Ebyssian's associate]], I would have us return to more pressing matters. 

Locating [[Fyrakk]] is still our primary mission. We cannot continue to delay it.

I have discovered a massive caldera at the western edge of [[Zaralek Cavern|Zaralek]]. If Fyrakk is still here, then logic dictates that this volcanic area would be his hideout.

Meet us there and we will proceed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
You found your way here. Good.

We have not seen Fyrakk yet, but we have seen djaradin. Many of them.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Meet us outside the caldera, <name>. If my suspicions are correct, we will need to tread stealthily.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Ebyssian, I think a smaller force of just you and <name> is prudent. No need to involve any others.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Hmm. I suppose it is for the best.}}
:''Sabellian and Ebyssian walk off.''

Catch up with them south of the [[Elders' Gift]] near [[Igira's Watch]]:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|The whispers grew louder for me as I approached. How are you faring Sabellian? You do not look well.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I am managing. I have dealt with the dark beckoning all my life. I had thought it would be gone with the fall of [[N'Zoth]], but evil always persists.}}

==Progression==
