[[File:In the Right Hands.jpg|thumb|The [[Ebon Eviscerator]], a [[Fearsome Artisan]] and a [[Brimstone Adept]]]]

==Objectives==
Retrieve the Ebon Eviscerator and the Resting Blade from the [[Brimstone Garrison]].
* [[Ebon Eviscerator]] {{co|45.1|18.5|Zaralek Cavern}}
* [['The Resting Blade']] {{co|45.1|21.0|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
[[File:Ebon Eviscerator.jpg|thumb|[[Ebon Eviscerator]]]]
There are several weapons of historical value that I believed were lost to time. I would bet my talons that they are here at this garrison.

The [[dragonspawn]] and [[drakonid]] loyally cling to the memory of my [[Neltharion|long-dead father]]. Misguided fools. 

They have access to my father's forges and weapons, and it is likely the very weapons I thought lost are stored nearby. 

If they find out what they have, they will use the weapons against us. They cannot remain in their claws.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +1000 reputation with [[Wrathion (faction)|Wrathion]]

==Progress==
These fools must be parted with such powerful blades.

==Completion==

We make a great team, my friend!

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|The true [[black dragonflight]] are the rightful owners of those weapons!}}
:''Those capable shift to their dragon forms and fly away. The rest run up the bridge.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I will find another way to [[Sarkareth]] while you push your attack here. We shall meet ahead and face him together.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Thank you, <name>. I will never forget your kindness in my time of need.}}
:''Emberthal flies away.''

[['The Resting Blade']] is by the forge in the on the eastern edge of the quest area guarded by a [[Fearsome Artisan]] and a [[Brimstone Assistant]]. The [[Ebon Eviscerator]] is due north next to an anvil by another Fearsome Artisan and a [[Brimstone Adept]].

Complete the objectives of this and the other quests, then find [[Wrathion]], [[Ebyssian]], and [[Sabellian]] atop a building in the northern part of the garrison.

On complete, Wrathion has new gossip:
:It feels so good to lay out one's frustrations through blade and flame, don't you think?

==Progression==
{{Inevitable Confrontation}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Hotfix|date=2024-08-26|bluenote=The Resting Blade should now be collectable.}}
*{{Patch 10.1.0|note=Added.}}
