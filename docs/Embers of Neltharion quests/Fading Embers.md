'''Fading Embers''' begins the fifth chapter of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]]: Inevitable Confrontation. This chapter was made available the week of May 9, 2023.

==Objectives==
Help [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] stop [[Sarkareth]] at the [[Brimstone Garrison]].
* Speak to Emberthal {{co|45.9|26.3|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Sarkareth stopped (0/100%)

==Description==
[[File:Fading Embers - Sarkareth.jpg|thumb|Sarkareth, two drakonid, and the blue circle on the ground]]
This is a difficult situation, my friend. Wounds and insecurities cannot be easily dismissed. Only time--and cooperation--can soothe the sting born of longstanding rivalries.

But there are more urgent matters to address. If there is a large force of [[drakonid]]s still loyal to the memory of [[Neltharion]], this land is much more dangerous than any of us expected.

Emberthal still pursues Sarkareth--alone. She must be made aware of the threats that surround her. We must find her and give her aid.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I only hope Emberthal has not fallen into danger.

==Completion==
Sarkareth may try to hide behind the might of Aberrus but to no avail.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I am not angry, <name>. If anything, I feel sad.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|It is heartbreaking to see Wrathion and Sabellian fighting like this, unable to put their ambitions and differences aside for even a moment.}}

Ebyssian has a new gossip:
:Once again, the sliterdrakes suffer because of the Black Dragonflight. It is only fair that we take action to rectify this situation.

Find [[Scalecommander Emberthal]] on the bridge into [[Brimstone Garrison]] from the [[Battlefield Ruins]]:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I do not know what Sarkareth is planning, but it cannot be anything good.}}

Speak with her:
:Sarkareth.
:I have been searching for him ever since we last crossed paths. I suspect he is still unready to see reason this time, but I cannot give up on him yet.
:There are so few of us left, now.
:{{gossip|quest=|I am ready to face him with you.}}
:''Emberthal runs forward and spots Sarkareth interacting with a titan console.''
:{{text|emote|Sarkareth lays a shred of the Oathbinder on the console.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Stop this, Sarkareth!}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|I am no coward like you. I will embrace the power available to me!}}

Step inside the blue circle on the ground and start defeating hostiles that appear, including [[Brimstone Bulwark|brimstone bulwarks]] and [[Brimstone Conspirator|conspirators]] until the bar fills. Once it hits 100%:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Follow the dark whispers if you must, but do not drag our people down with you. Let them make their own choice!}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|The [[Sundered Flame]] are mine to use as I please!}}
:''Ebyssian flies in and uses his breath attack on Sarkareth.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|No matter. You are beneath my attention, Emberthal!}}
:''Sarkareth flies away.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Thank you, Ebyssian.}}
:''Emberthal and Ebyssian walk to the midpoint of the bridge.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Are you all right?}}
:{{text|emote|Emberthal sighs.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I want to save my people... but Sarkareth has the protection of Aberrus now. We may be unable to stop him.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Perhaps not. Leave that to me.}}

Before complete, Ebyssian has new gossip:
:Our flight stands more fractured than ever, but this is not how the story will end.

And after complete:
:Sarkareth wielding Oathbinder, briefly as it was, has marked him or he still carries a shred of it. Now the power of Aberrus is on his side.
:Troubling. Most troubling.
