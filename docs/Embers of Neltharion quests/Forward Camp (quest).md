==Objectives==
Find [[Ebyssian]] in the [[Brimstone Garrison]].
* Meet Ebyssian at the Brimstone Garrison

==Description==
Since [[Scalecommander Sarkareth|Sarkareth]] now wields the power of [[Aberrus]]'s defenses, he has an army that will shield him from us.

The next step for us will be to establish a stronghold inside the garrison. That way we can search it without interruption. 

Meet me there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +50 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
I have full faith we will carve a path through the garrison.

==Completion==
Good. Now we can safely support Emberthal in her search. I know she will succeed in stopping Sarkareth.

==Notes==
Ebyssian has new gossip here:
:I am pleased to see us working as one, finally. I hope this is a sign of a united future.

On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|The true [[black dragonflight]] are the rightful owners of those weapons!}}
:''Those capable shift to their dragon forms and fly away. The rest run up the bridge.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I will find another way to Sarkareth while you push your attack here. We shall meet ahead and face him together.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Thank you, <name>. I will never forget your kindness in my time of need.}}
:''Emberthal flies away.''

Complete the objectives of the other quests, then find [[Wrathion]], [[Ebyssian]], and [[Sabellian]] atop a building in the northern part of the garrison.

On complete, Ebyssian has new gossip:
:These dragonspawn have borne a loyalty to a dead dragon for thousands of years. I admire their tenacity and steadfastness. I only hope that we can convince them that there is another way.

==Progression==
