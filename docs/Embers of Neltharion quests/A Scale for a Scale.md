[[File:Zaqali Dragonslayer's Spear.jpg|thumb|upright|Zaqali Dragonslayer's Spear]]

==Objectives==
Collect a Zaqali Dragonslayer's Spear for [[Sabellian]].
* [[Zaqali Dragonslayer's Spear]] {{co|28.9|50.9|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Head to the overlook {{co|29.5|49.8|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
[[Igira|The elder]] waking was a threat, certainly. But there is one more mission I must complete before we depart, lest we lose our only chance to complete it at all.

However different the [[Zaqali tribe]] may be from the [[Qalashi]], they are still dragonslayers. Their implements of war are no less deadly to our kind.

I need a spear on par with the one we saw at the elder's side. Find the largest one you can and deliver it to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +500 reputation with [[Sabellian (faction)|Sabellian]]

==Progress==
[[Djaradin]] weapons are vile creations, but they were created for one task and one task alone.

==Completion==
This is the only way forward.

==Notes==
The spear in question is in the center of camp, leaning up against a rock near the war drum. Pick it up:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|This may look primitive and barbaric, but this is a finely crafted instrument of war.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|The mere sight of it fills me with dread.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Understandable. This is a weapon with one purpose: [[dragon]] slaying.}}

Head to the overlook to the north:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Now all our preparation and pain will come to fruition. We have the weapon. We have the opportunity. We must not waste it.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Is this said as the [[General (rank)|general]] who protected [[Black dragonflight|our flight]] in [[Outland]]? Or as a defeated warrior looking for revenge?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|They are one in the same. Revenge does wonders in focusing the mind. That is how I protected our people in Outland.}}

==Progression==
{{The Ancient Bargain}}
