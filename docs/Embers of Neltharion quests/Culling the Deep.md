==Objectives==
Kill 8 Deepflayers.
* Deepflayers slain (8)

==Description==
[[File:VZ-Deepflayer Nest.jpg|thumb|Area map]]
Have you seen these deepflayers before? Well, of course you have! You were almost eaten by one!

They're getting a little too cozy to me and my people's settlement nearby, and need to be dealt with. Inside the cave, outside the cave, they're all over the place! That's why I came here in the first place.

Since I can tell we'll be ramblin' round with each other for a bit, why not give me a hand?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Not bad, uplander! Have you dabbled in monster hunting before this?

==Completion==
Did you made friends with any of the flayers?

Hah! Just kidding! That was a joke! Please don't try to do that unless you want become some swooper's tasty snack!

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Don't worry, I've got excellent control of my claws. It's my eyesight that has never been good.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Don't move a whisker!}}

An extra action button appears:
:{{abilities|Escape Crystals|Brace for a strong strike from Honeypelt.|id=403458|image=}}

Use it:
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|There you go, uplander. What say we go find those friends I smell on you?}}

After escaping (and speaking with Honeypelt again), start killing the deepflayers in the [[Deepflayer Nest]] including [[Scavenging Slicer|scavenging slicers]] and [[Swooping Flayer|swooping flayers]]. Don't focus on killing enemies before working on the other quest, though.

Upon wrapping up both quests and exiting the micro-dungeon, Honeypelt has new gossip:
:You seem like a rough and tumble sort. I like you. I mean, you smell weird to me! But I still like ya.

As does Wrathion:
:I just--Gragh!
:Need a moment to--Hnf!
:Work through my thoughts! Gyah!

As does Sabellian:
:Frustrating as he is, I see some part of my young self in Wrathion.
