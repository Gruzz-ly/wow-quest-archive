==Description==
[[File:VZ-Deepflayer Nest.jpg|thumb|Area map]]
You're smellin' real down and out there, kid. Can't imagine what you been through to end up here.

Well, it don't matter! We [[niffen]] ain't the sort to leave anyone behind. Especially not people who're about to be served up as a [[deepflayer]]'s snack!

This master sniffin' snout of mine can smell you didn't come down here to our [[Zaralek Cavern]] alone. What say we get you out of those crystals and find your friends!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Told you we'd sniff out your companions!

Though it seems like they're carrying a lot of dirt on their backs. The figurative kind, I mean.

Anyway! If you're willing to pay back the favor of me rescuing you, I've still got some business here.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Don't worry, I've got excellent control of my claws. It's my eyesight that has never been good.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Don't move a whisker!}}

An extra action button appears:
:{{abilities|Escape Crystals|Brace for a strong strike from Honeypelt.|id=403458|image=}}

Use it:
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|There you go, uplander. What say we go find those friends I smell on you?}}

Speak with Honeypelt again:
:Ain't nothing to be afraid of down here. I mean, except the big 'ol deepflayers.
:And the killer snails.
:And the poisonous spore bats.
:Maybe the falling rocks too, but those aren't a problem if you can burrow in the dirt!
:{{gossip|quest=|Can you lead me to my companions?}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Shouldn't be a problem. They may be out of sight, but very little escapes this nose.}}

Start killing a path to the cave exit to find Honeypelt in a dirt pile:
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Not here! Can you deal with these deepflayers? I'll need the space to sniff out where your friend is.}}

Kill some more then interact with the hole again to give the all clear.
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Okay!}}
:''Honeypelt starts running to the northwest.''
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Oh no! Your friend was dragged off by a deepflayer. This way!}}
:''Honeypelt dives under the ground again.''

Run to the next spot:
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Not here either! Just more deepflayers. Take care of them, so they can't bamboozle my sniffer!}}

Interact with the hole again:
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Oh, I got it now! Your friend spends a lot of time trying to smell nice, doesn't he?}}
:''Honeypelt keeps moving.''

:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Oh, there we go. Smells like spices and expensive oils, with just a note of flop sweat underneath.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|<name>! Get me out of these blasted crystals! They are blocking my ability to transform!}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Behind you! Those foul creatures are back!}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Just relax and let your friend the <class> protect our lives while I break you out.}}

Two deepflayers ambush. Take them out:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Thank you, <name>! I normally do not fall prey to such creatures!}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Free as a sparrow! Meet us outside the cave, <name>!}}

Head outside to catch up with Wrathion and Sabellian:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I just expected more after listening to you boast about how you slew [[N'Zoth]] single handedly!}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|It was a team effort! Something you are incapable of understanding!}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|We are the Black Dragonflight! That means something! Neltharion would never have fallen to such a foe.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Comparing yourself to daddy dearest? You have shown your true colors if that is your aspiration!}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Father!-- Wait... Father. Yes. I knew that relic back there looked familiar.}}
:''Sabellian runs off to the southeast.''
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Are you walking away from me? Two can play at that game! If you need me, <name>, seek me over there.}}
:''Wrathion walks northwest and starts shadowboxing.''
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Those two remind me of my cousins. They couldn't stand each other either. I'd use them to flush out bone spiders with their bickering.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Well, uplander, I could some assistance. I figure since I saved your sniffer, least you could do is help me with some hunting.}}

Honeypelt has new gossip:
:You seem like a rough and tumble sort. I like you. I mean, you smell weird to me! But I still like ya.

As does Wrathion:
:I just--Gragh!
:Need a moment to--Hnf!
:Work through my thoughts! Gyah!
