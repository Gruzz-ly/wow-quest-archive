'''The Land Beneath''' begins the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]], starting the [[patch 10.1]] portion of the [[Dragonflight campaign]]. This breadcrumb quest to [[Zaralek Cavern]] will be pushed to max-level players, who have completed [[A Creche Divided]], automatically after logging in.

==Objectives==
Meet the [[black dragonflight]] at the [[Seat of the Aspects]] in [[Valdrakken]].

==Description==
[[Alexstrasza|The Life-Binder]] has news of [[Primal Incarnates|the Incarnates]], and she requests our presence at the Seat of the Aspects.

The black dragonflight will await you there, <name>.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|2|25}}
* 2,375 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Dragon Aspects|The Aspects]] have gathered. Let us not keep them waiting.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|The Life-Binder has news of the Incarnates, and she requests our presence at the Seat of the Aspects. I will await you there, <name>.}}

Atop the Seat of the Aspects, Ebyssian, Sabellian, and Wrathion have already arrived. Sabellian has gossip:
:Good to see you again, <name>.
:The Life-Binder's news must be important to have called us all here. If it concerns the Incarnates and she plans to send us after them, I would be pleased to have my fellow black dragons support me.
:I am still the clear choice for Aspect, but my kin are more than capable enough to accomplish such a task with me.

As does Wrathion:
:Ah, <name>. Good of you to come.
:Take a look at this. It's a tome found amongst the rubble and ruin of what used to be the Obsidian Citadel's library. Its script is one I have very little experience with, but the exercise of translating it has kept me most amused while awaiting everyone's arrival.
:There was another one under the nearby debris, a sister tome, as it were. I brought it with me here, but I do not believe I have ample time to decipher the texts of both.
:<Wrathion pops an eyebrow at you.>
:Mind taking a crack at it yourself? I have always found you determined when it comes to little mysteries.
:{{gossip|<Accept the book from Wrathion.>}}
:''The player receives the [[Untranslated Obsidian Tome]].''

Speak with Wrathion again for more gossip:
:No need to dwell too much on the tome, <name>. Ancient history seldom calls for immediate action.
:Well... Unless it escapes from a vault after thousands of years and unleashes its havoc-wreaking siblings on the world.
