==Objectives==
Meet [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] within the [[Aberrus Approach]].
* Emberthal met
*Find Emberthal within the Aberrus Approach.

==Description==
Now that we have a foothold within [[Brimstone Garrison|the garrison]], we can extend our search. We will hold off the forces of [[Aberrus]] here while you find Emberthal and aid her in reaching [[Scalecommander Sarkareth|Sarkareth]]. We will join you as soon as we secure the front here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
There he is.

Aberrus protects him still as he works on that device. There must be a way for us to strip his defenses!

==Notes==
Sabellian has a new gossip:
:Wrathion is transparent and easy to unbalance which makes him a predictable opponent.

:My read of Ebyssian is that he wants to serve the black dragonflight... but that his altruism is true is hard for me to believe.

So does Wrathion:
:It feels so good to lay out one's frustrations through blade and flame, don't you think?

And Ebyssian as well:
:These dragonspawn have borne a loyalty to a dead dragon for thousands of years. I admire their tenacity and steadfastness. I only hope that we can convince them that there is another way.

On approach:
