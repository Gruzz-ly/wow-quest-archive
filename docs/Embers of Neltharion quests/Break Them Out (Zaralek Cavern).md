'''Break Them Out''' concludes the fourth chapter of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]], "Inherited Sin", alongside [[Worst of the Worst (Zaralek Cavern)]]. The campaign continues with [[Fading Embers]].

==Objectives==
Disrupt the poachers and stop them from capturing the [[slitherdrake]]s.
* [[Poacher]]s' operation disrupted (0/100%)

==Description==
Cages, chains and transportation carts... I think we all know where this leads.

If the [[drakonid]]s plan on capturing and enslaving the slitherdrakes, then they are no better than the [[djaradin]].

See what you can do to thwart their plans.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* [[Winding Slitherdrake: Swept Horns]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==
The slitherdrakes are free! Well done, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Overseer Xymra|Hurry up and lock their cages. We march for Aberrus soon.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Xymra|I will personally make sure these... experiments never again escape from the lab.}}

Enter the [[Slitherdrake Roost]] proper, then kill [[Drakonid Poacher]]s (+10%), open cages (+15%) to free slitherdrakes, and destroy [[Transportation Cart]]s (+10%) to fill the bar.

On completion of both, an in-engine cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|Ui3i7NPm0xA}}
:''One of the slitherdrakes sits down and curls up as [[Sabellian]] walks over to it and [[Wrathion]].''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|These serpent creatures may prove useful, if they can be made to serve [[Black dragonflight|the flight]].}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|They are not creatures, Sabellian; they are our kin.}}
:''Sabellian walks northwest to look at [[Brimstone Garrison]] as one of the slitherdrakes flies toward [[Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible|Aberrus]] in the distance.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|They are [[Deathwing|my father]]'s failed experiments, nothing more.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Fodder for the battlefield.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|How we were created does not define us.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Or am I just fodder to you as well?}}
:''At this, Sabellian turns around to look at Wrathion.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Yes. That is precisely what you are.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|You are wrong.}}
:''Wrathion walks away in a huff. Ebyssian gets up from looking at the Zaqali Berserker corpse and walks over to Sabellian, who is now looking at the [[Elders' Gift]].''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Do you not see that your fates are bound?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Deny it as you might, he is your brother, and you are his.}}
:''The curled-up slitherdrake flies away and catches up with another heading west.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Two wings, that must learn to fly, or fail, together... before it is too late.}}
:''The scene fades to black.''
