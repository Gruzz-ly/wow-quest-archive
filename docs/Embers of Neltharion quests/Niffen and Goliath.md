==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Deepflayer Broodmatron.jpg|Deepflayer Broodmatron|Big an' tough exterior. Soft an' sweet interior.<br><br> For eating, I mean!}}
Slay the Deepflayer Broodmatron.
* Pungent Bait placed (Optional) {{co|58.4|39.0|Zaralek Cavern}}
* [[Deepflayer Broodmatron]] slain

==Description==
I didn't just come all the way out here to save your sniffers, ya know!

The [[deepflayer]]s are vicious and stubborn, like obsidian ore. We've tried to lead them from our town by leaving out food and such, but they're all too keen to attack our sparrow caravans.

It's the big'un ruling over them that'll be trouble. Want to pay me back? Let's you, me, and [[Wrathion|your cologne-scented friend]] hunt it down together. I've got the perfect bait we can use too!

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Endowed Bindings]]
* [[Inherited Wristbands]]
* [[Bequeathed Bracers]]
* [[Bestowed Vambraces]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Yeesh! Certainly wasn't no lack of fight in that one, was there!

==Notes==
[[File:Niffin and Goliath.jpg|thumb|[[Elder Honeypelt]], [[Wrathion]], and Honeypelt's Pungent Bait]]
On accept:
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Well let's get going. I've got the most stinky bait, It'll be perfect.}}
:''Wrathion stops shadowpunching and walks over.''
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Before we start... I know my relationship with [[Sabellian]] is certainly strained, but our behavior back there was out of line.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I think it is this place. Something out there is testing my mental defenses. Worming its way through my mind and keeping my teeth on edge.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I will speak to Sabellian about the outburst in my own time. Things are never simple with him. You both have my apologies.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|You boys just need to sniff it out. Words can hurt, but the nose never lies.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Well, it does if we set a trap with these chunks of meat! The big'un deepflayer we're after will be lured into our ambush by the smell!}}
:''Honeypelt dives underground as she and Wrathion head out.''

Head west to the small cave and place the sack down at the ghost Honeypelt's Pungent Bait object to spawn the Deepflayer Broodmatron:
:{{text|yell|Deepflayer Broodmatron|GRRRRAAAWWWAAAAAAAAAAAARRR!}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Now!}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|This beast is huge!}}

Finish it off:
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Ooh. I am definitely getting too old to do this solo. Let's take a breath and regroup.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Fantastic! I needed to blow off some steam.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Ah! You did a good job with that big fellah, uplander. Why don't I show the cologne-wearer here how to dress a deepflayer?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I'll have you know I am quite the outdoorsman. I could prepare this fellow with my eyes shut.}}

Honeypelt has new gossip:
:What a scuffle! And quite the moves you two have!
:Big'uns like that used to be a walk in the park for me, so I'm mighty glad you and the cologne-scented one were there to back me up.
:Just shows that age comes for us all. Even the most gorgeous-smelling of niffen.

As does Wrathion:
:Excellent move back there. Do not be shy! I saw how you tossed a new technique or two at that ferocious beast.
:Impressive as always, <name>!
:...Do you have any compliments for me?
