[[File:A Crack in the World.jpg|thumb|The [[Dragon Aspects]] and [[Ebyssian]], [[Sabellian]], and [[Wrathion]]]]

==Objectives==
Speak with [[Alexstrasza]].
*Speak with Alexstrasza concerning the Incarnates {{co|59.1|37.2|Valdrakken}}
*Listen to the Aspects (Optional)

==Description==
As you can see, [[Wrathion]] and [[Sabellian]] are also ready. If the [[Dragon Aspects|the Aspects]] have news of the [[Primal Incarnates|Incarnates']] actions, then the [[black dragonflight]] is prepared to answer the call.

Come. They are eager to speak with us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|7|2|25}}
* 2,375 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Wrathion and Sabellian made waiting for your arrival quite... tedious. 

I wish they could turn their boundless enthusiasm for bickering toward worthier means. Perhaps they just need the motivation.

==Completion==
I have read what I can about the Incarnates.

[[Fyrakk]] is every ounce as powerful as [[Iridikron]], only lacking the discipline to focus that strength into singular goals. He would be just as happy burning his own followers down as he would our people.

This will be a fight that all [[Dragon Isles|the Isles']] denizens have a stake in.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''The collected dragons shift into their visage forms and all walk to the center.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Life-Binder, <name> has arrived. Tell us what has happened.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|We have received disturbing news. The Incarnates have attacked [[Ohn'ahran Plains|the Ohn'ahran]] border.}}

Speak with Alexstrasza:
:Though unclear, [[Iridikron]]'s actions tell us there is a plan in motion.
:Come, <name>. Let us discuss how best to end the terror he intends to unleash against [[Azeroth]].
:{{gossip|What news is there of the Incarnates?}}

A [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|pre-rendered cutscene]] plays, "Opening the Way":
{{#ev:youtube|vhdgBFCEtls}}
:''Eastern Ohn'ahran Plains, nighttime. The scene starts with an establishing shot of [[Valdrakken]] off in the distance before rotating down to show [[Shalkeel]], a [[centaur]] of [[Clan Shikaar]], patrolling an apparently deserted [[Timberstep Outpost]] by himself. Hearing the flapping of wings, he stops and looks up to spot the three remaining [[Primal Incarnates]] shrieking across the sky before they disappear behind the trees and land with an explosion in the distance.''
:{{text|bossemote|Shalkeel|Hmm.}}
:''Shalkeel narrows his eyes and walks toward the noise, carefully looking around with spear in both hands. He spots [[Fyrakk|Fyrakk the Blazing]], the Incarnate of Fire, in visage form at the edge of the forest overlooking [[Cascades Canyon]]. Shalkeel slams the butt of his spear into the ground, then points it at Fyrakk as he starts barking an order, but sputters to a stop as realization sets in.''
:{{text|bossemote|Shalkeel|Halt! You trespass in Shikaar territory! Explain what you... are... doing... here.}}
:''Shalkeel involuntarily takes a few steps back as Fyrakk snarls, turning toward the centaur. The scene briefly cuts to black as Fyrakk launches an attack on Shalkeel. The centaur groans and falls to the ground, dead, and hidden by a cloud of smoke. Barely deigning to notice, Fyrakk blows out the fire in his right hand and grunts in annoyance.''
:{{text|bossemote|Fyrakk|Can we get on with it? You said we'd find it here.}}
:''Fyrakk walks closer to the cliff edge, where [[Iridikron|Iridikron the Stonescaled]] and [[Vyranoth|Vyranoth the Frozenheart]], Incarnates of earth and frost, are standing.''
:{{text|bossemote|Vyranoth|We have. From what I have transcribed, Neltharion had a hidden path to Aberrus, just below this ridge.}}
:''Vyranoth points to the cenote they are all looking at, marked by three waterfalls and a small island with a tree on it.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|Sealed beneath earth and water, undisturbed for thousands of years.}}
:{{text|bossemote|Vyranoth|Then let us open the way.}}
:''Vyranoth unleashes an ice attack from her right hand, freezing the tree, island, and water with a channeled spell.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|Fyrakk, you will feast upon the [[shadowflame|elemental power]] below.}}
:''Iridikron unleashes an earth attack from his right hand, shattering the frozen land and water.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|Wake the Elders from their slumber and incinerate any who stand in our way.}}
:''Fyrakk snarls in excitement, then takes off in a sprint toward edge of the cliff. He grunts as he jumps into the air, shifts back to his proto-dragon form with a blast of fire, hovers for a few flaps of his wings, then roars and dive-bombs the cenote, which blasts open a tunnel deep into the earth.''
:{{text|bossemote|Vyranoth|Exquisite. In his wake, the dracthyr will succumb to the temptation of Aberrus and unleash the Aspects' darkest nightmares.}}
:''She pauses to look at Iridikron.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|Come. We have much to do.}}
:''They walk away. From the [[Thaldraszus]] side of Cascades Canyon, [[Scalecommander Sarkareth]] and several of his dracthyr are shown looking on.''
:{{text|bossemote|Iridikron|Let the children of Neltharion claim their birthright.}}

After the cutscene:
:{{text|say|Kalecgos|Why usher Fyrakk below instead of going himself?}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Iridikron has always had his schemes, but Fyrakk has only sought out power. Whatever they seek will bring suffering to dragons and mortals alike.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Ebyssian, Sabellian, Wrathion. We must call upon you to pursue him with <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|It will be done, Life-Binder.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|We will ensure Fyrakk's destruction.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Whatever it takes.}}

[[Kalecgos]] has gossip:
:It is rare that I see our queen so unsettled.
:I believe the best chance we have is to continue growing our ranks. In my very soul, I know that there are still members of my flight who are out there.

As does [[Nozdormu]]:
:Seeing the past through Emberthal's eyes gave us insight into our lost brother. Neltharion pursued deeply misguided means to stop his foes, and now they have arisen.
:We will never forgive him. But his bloodline, that well which we had believed so thoroughly poisoned, will become our greatest of strengths in the coming battles.
:That is not something I have seen in the timeways as the Bronze Aspect, but rather, it is rather something I feel as a fellow dragon.

On complete:
:''The three aspects return to their usual spots and shift back to their dragon forms.''
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Do not underestimate the Incarnates. Fair skies and strong winds to you all.}}
