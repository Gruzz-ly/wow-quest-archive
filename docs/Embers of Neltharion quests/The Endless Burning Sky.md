==Objectives==
Extinguish the fires consuming [[Loamm]] and rescue 5 Loamm villagers.
* Fires extinguished (0/100%)
* Search for villagers (5)
* Look for [[Elder Honeypelt]] {{co|56.5|55.5|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Fire cleared from doorway

==Description==
[[File:Terrified Niffen.png|thumb|[[Terrified Niffen]]]]

Fyrakk must have breathed [[shadowflame]] upon the [[niffen]] on his way out of the cavern. There is too much fire for it to have merely sloughed off of him.

He did this on purpose.

<[[Ebyssian]] clenches his staff tightly. He looks weary for a moment. Only a moment.>

We will save Loamm. All of Loamm. No more lives will be lost.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<Ebyssian struggles to catch his breath, wiping the sweat from his brow.>

Fyrakk will answer for this.

I swear.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Sabellian]]|The town burns. We must act quickly--}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|You are still injured, Sabellian, and the town is filled with Fyrakk's shadowflame. Stay here. <name>, with me!}}
:''Ebyssian joins the party.''

Players gain an extra action button and a buff for this quest:
*{{Abilities|Smoldering Earth|Ebyssian has recovered enough strength to extinguish all fires in the targeted area!|range=40|id=401160|icon=shaman_pvp_rockshield|notes=Instant}}
*{{Abilities|Emergency Response|Movement speed increased by 50%.|id=406869|icon=spell_fire_burningspeed}}

Ebyssian has the Recovered Strength progress bar over his head, slowly refilling over time. Each use of Smoldering Earth takes nearly the entire bar away. The extra action button will return once Ebyssian refills it. He can say one of:
*{{text|say|Ebyssian|I will find the strength!}}
*{{text|say|Ebyssian|Strength of the earth, aid me!}}
*{{text|say|Ebyssian|We must save them all!}}
*{{text|say|Ebyssian|We must help... these good people!}}

The villagers for this quest are all named and marked on the minimap:
; [[Aquinan]]: <Deep, erratic circles are dug into the earth around Aquinan, as if he attempted to burrow away from the flames.
: He did not dig fast enough.>
; [[Gloowaz Bonesmusher]]: The fire blast... It knocked me right into the rock--
: <Gloowaz coughs roughly, blood spattering the ground.>
: My... head hurts...
: {{gossip|I'll help you stand up. Come on!}}
: {{text|say|Gloowaz Bonesmusher|Too late... for me...}}
:''Gloowaz succumbs to his wounds.''
; [[Cenka]]: W-What happened?
: There's so much smoke... I can't smell where I am!
: {{gossip|You need to evacuate!}}
: {{text|say|Cenka|I'll try to follow your scent to safety!}}
; [[Teek]]: <In his last moments, it appears that Teek tried to escape the fires by diving into the water. He did not make it in time.
: A smooth worry-crystal is still clutched in one of his hands.>
; [[Tale-Teller Talpi]]: It was too fast, I-- I... 
: Why is everyone s-screaming? Where...
: {{gossip|You need to evacuate!}}
: {{text|say|Tale-Teller Talpi|Please, save the others!}}

Put out enough fires and find enough villagers, then head for the center building:
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Brynn, please wake up! We've been through worse! I taught you the first rule of hunting was to always come home safely...}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Elder! We need to get you out of here.}}

[[File:The Endless Burning Sky - Honeypelt and Brynnsahce.jpg|thumb|[[Elder Honeypelt]] and [[Brynnsahce]]]]
Honeypelt is in shock, trying to move [[Brynnsahce]], who did not survive the attack. Speak with her:
:I-- He-- I-It happened too fast, I couldn't--
:<Honeypelt bows her head, the rest of her words caught on a sob. 
:She shakes Brynnsahce's arm one more time. He does not move.>
:{{gossip|We need to get out of here.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I will clear the flames from this doorway. Come with me!}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|I'm not leaving Brynnsahce here, I won't--}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I will carry him. Go now, while it is safe!}}
:''Ebyssian blows out the shadowflame, picks up Honeypelt, and they both run out.''
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|Brynn... You should have sought cover instead of worrying about me. You were so young.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I am so sorry, Elder.}}
:{{text|say|Elder Honeypelt|That beast, the one that smelled like death and sulfur. You kill it for Brynnsahce, you hear?}}

Outside, Honeypelt has new gossip:
:He was the best student I've had. I can't remember if I ever told him that.
:{{gossip|I'm sorry for your loss.}}
:Don't be sorry.
:Be angry. It's what we need.

Not an objective of the quest, but Myrrit reacts to the event:
:I can't possibly focus on digging while my town is on fire!
