==Notes==
;Speaking with Lassik
You there, stop slouching, your posture could use some correcting.

I apologize, sometimes my profession gets the better of me. I appear to have fallen afoul of the beings here and they have taken my vital equipment.

These chains are not good for my own posture. I don't suppose you could assist me in my endeavors?

{{gossip|Yes, I will help.}}

;Upon accept:
:{{Text|say|Lassik Spinebender|Thank you, Maw Walker! Now the hunt begins.}}

;Upon completion:
:{{Text|say|Lassik Spinebender|That is it. I am hoping this should work wonders for those with back problems. Maybe I should stay with you and assist you with your posture too. What do you say to a good bending?}}
