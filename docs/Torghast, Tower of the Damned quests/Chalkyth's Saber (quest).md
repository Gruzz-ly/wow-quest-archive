==Notes==
;Speaking with Chalkyth
Yes, you caught me, have you come to gloat? Oh, you're not one of them.

I've been captured and stripped of my weapons, do you think you could assist me with a daring escape?

{{Gossip|Yes, I will help}}
:{{Text|Say|Chalkyth|Good show! Let's go find my saber and give these things a good thrashing.}}

On completion:
:{{Text|Say|Bloodletter Phantoriax|Ah there it is! I must say it has lost none of its edge or luster. I shall proudly wield it once more.}}
