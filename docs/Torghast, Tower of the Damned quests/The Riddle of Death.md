==Objectives==
Help [[Croman]] kill [[Lord of Woe|his captor]]

==Rewards==
*[[Prisoner's Anima]] cell

==Notes==
Speak to Croman to start the bonus objective:
:I have been placed in chains by a foul sorcerer!
:Free me so that I may teach him what is best in life! And in death, I suppose.
:{{gossip|Yes, I will help.}}
:{{text|say|Croman|I told him I would be back! I would hate to disappoint.}}

Look for the [[Lord of Woe]] and defeat it:
:{{text|say|Croman|You've just been exterminated.}}

Croman leaves behind a [[Prisoner's Anima]] cache, and also offers to become the adventurer's follower in [[Champion: Croman]].
