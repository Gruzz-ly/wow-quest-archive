*[[Torghast]] wing completed

==Description==
I've heard of you, the [[Maw Walker]]! You must know of me, the legendary Ve'nish.

I am here to find great treasures within Torghast with the aid of [[The Box of Many Things|my box]]. I can see you admiring it.

Perhaps we can work together. Why don't you go into Torghast ahead of me to scout ahead?

I shall even reward you for anything you discover within.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|70|20|}}
* 11,550 [[XP]]
*[[Bonus Experience]]
*150x [[Soul Ash]]

==Progress==
How goes exploring the darkness of Torghast?

==Completion==
Ah, the place is filled to the brink with all sorts of terrible creatures... and also plenty of powers!

Perfect! Did you hear that, box? We'll find plenty in this place... perhaps even more than that coward [[Ve'nari]] out in the [[Maw]].

Ahem, thank you, Maw Walker. You've done your part well. I shall have more questions later.
