==Notes==
;Speaking with Gallath
You... you're the Maw Walker, aren't you?  None are truly free in this wretched place but I was captured and chained when I foolishly left behind an item of great importance to me.

Will you free me and assist me in tracking it down?

{{Gossip|Yes, I will help.}}
:{{text|say|Gallath|Thank you, Maw Walker. A relic of great importance to me lies somewhere within the tower. I must find it.}}

;On completion
:{{text|say|Gallath|Ah, you have found it!}}
:{{text|say|Gallath|Your aid is most appreciated. Go in service, Maw Walker.}}
