'''In Darkness, Found''' is a breadcrumb to the [[The Box of Many Things]] unlock quests, started from [[Xy'lonu]] at [[Keeper's Respite]] in [[Korthia]]. Ve'nish can be found on floor two of any layer, so if players are specifically looking to unlock The Box of Many Things, do this on layer one.

==Objectives==
Find [[Ve'nish]] in [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned]].

==Description==
[[Cartel Ve]] has a reputation for creeping around dangerous places in search of treasure. If they had any sense, they would leave the acquisition and sale of goods to [[Cartel Xy|the Xy]]. Alas.

One Ve member disappeared into Torghast with a plundered box of powerful items that he assumed would help him explore in safety. Madness!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Step no closer! Reveal yourself!

==Progression==
