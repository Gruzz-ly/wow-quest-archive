'''Tower Knowledge''' unlocks the [[The Box of Many Things]] mechanic in [[Torghast, Tower of the Damned]]. To start this short quest chain, find the broker [[Ve'nish]] on a run of any standard wing in Torghast.

==Objectives==
Place the Box of Many Things in [[Torghast]].
*[[The Box of Many Things (item)]] (provided)

==Description==
The woven power of this box can only be unlocked by feeding it pride and memory. In its weave are incantations I have seen used in the other realms to siphon or condition a soul. This... abomination... has used these tools of redemption and honor to create a lock.

As you challenge the floors of Torghast, your skill, speed, and efficiency will all contribute to [[:Tower Knowledge]] which this box can feed upon. 

Feed it to retrieve the powers within.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: [[The Box of Many Things]]

You will also receive:
* 20x [[Tower Knowledge]]
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]
*[[The Box of Many Things (achievement)]]

==Progress==
The Box of Many Things thrums with power.

==Completion==
<The box hungers, reaching into your memories of Torghast for past deeds to feed upon.>

==Progression==
