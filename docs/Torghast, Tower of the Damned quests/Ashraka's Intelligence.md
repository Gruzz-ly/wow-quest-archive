==Notes==
Ashraka gossip:
:Maw Walker. I have seen you stalking these halls.
:Alas my overconfidence resulted in my capture. I still have a mission I need to fulfill, a high ranking minion of the Jailer has some valuable information I need to obtain.
:{{gossip|Yes, I will help.}}
:{{text|say|Ashraka|They are nearby, show no remorse.}}

Look for a marked elite, like a [[Lord of Anguish]], and kill it.
:{{text|say|Ashraka|An inevitable outcome. I shall take this information and return to my post.}}
