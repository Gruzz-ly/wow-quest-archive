==Objectives==
[[File:A Long Walk - Crucible.jpg|thumb|The crowd in the Crucible]]
Speak to [[Uther the Lightbringer|Uther]] in [[Oribos]] to escort [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] to the [[Enclave]], then speak to [[Tal-Inara]] to be brought to the [[Crucible (Oribos)|Crucible]].
*Speak to Uther{{Co|52.27|39.85|Oribos}}
*Sylvanas escorted
*Speak to Tal-Inara{{Co|38.9|69.97|Oribos}}

==Description==
[[Pelagos|The Arbiter]] awaits us. Though few are allowed within the Crucible, several who hail from [[Azeroth]] have been granted permission to bear witness as he passes judgment on Sylvanas.

Yet we are far from the only ones affected by all the carnage Sylvanas has wrought. Her actions have brought pain and suffering to a great many.

Screaming back at the Banshee as she passes might be their only chance to speak their mind. Let them be heard.

==Completion==
Thank you for joining us, my friend.

I felt it important that you be here to witness this moment.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Uther|Come. Let us be on our way.}}

Talk to Uther again:
:Shall we proceed, <name>?
:{{Gossip|<Escort Sylvanas to the Enclave.>}}

Uther and Sylvanas begin walking counterclockwise around the ring before heading into the Enclave. Along the way, the crowd shouts insults at Sylvanas.
:{{Text|say|[[Sylvari Artisan]]|You defiled our sacred groves!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Apprentice Ritualist]]|Torment is all you deserve!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Venthyr Aristocrat]]|Your sins are beyond measure!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Kyrian Aspirant]]|How many [[soul]]s have you doomed?!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Orc Soul]]|We trusted you! You betrayed us all!}}
:{{Text|say|[[Night Elf Soul]]|[[Teldrassil|My home]]! My family! All burned to ashes!}}

When they reach the Enclave:
:{{Text|say|Uther|Is it justice they seek? Or vengeance?}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Anger and pain make it difficult to tell the difference.}}

Upon coming up to the [[Shadowlands Map]], both Sylvanas and Uther teleport up to the Crucible. Talk to Tal-Inara to do the same:
:Your purpose and ours are entwined it seems.
:{{Gossip|Take me to the Crucible.}}

In the Crucible, a large crowd is gathered in front of the Arbiter, who is now wearing the [[Crown of Wills]]. When the player arrives:
:{{Text|say|Arbiter Pelagos|The flow of souls into the [[Maw]] has ended. The [[covenant]]s, and the [[Shadowlands]], have been restored. Only one task remains.}}

The crowd consists of untargetable [[Onlooker]]s from the covenant races, interspersed with many named characters: [[Highlord Darion Mograine]], [[Calia Menethil]], [[Lilian Voss]], [[Lor'themar Theron]], [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]], [[Tyrande Whisperwind]], [[Shandris Feathermoon]], [[Maiev Shadowsong]], [[Capheus]], [[Rendle]], [[Anduin Wrynn]], [[Lady Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Thrall]], [[Genn Greymane]], [[Alleria Windrunner]], [[Vereesa Windrunner]], [[Baine Bloodhoof]], [[Highlord Bolvar Fordragon]], and [[Taelia Fordragon]]. Sylvanas and Uther wait at the back of the crowd. A line of [[Attendant Protector]]s stand at the front of the crowd, between them and the Arbiter. Projections of the covenant rulers—[[Kyrestia the Firstborne|Kyrestia]], the [[Winter Queen]], the [[Primus]], and [[Prince Renathal|Renathal]]—are overseeing the event from atop their pillars, and two [[Protector Captain]]s are standing guard over the exit portal.
