==Objectives==
Recover the Stolen Artifact in the [[Arrangement Index]] and restore it to its rightful place.
*[[Stolen Artifact]]
* [[Orb of Transference|Orb]] placed
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
The [[automa]] were once abundant here, singing, constructing various things, carrying out the purpose of the [[First Ones]]. Then, invaders from the [[Maw]] slaughtered them all.

The last automa to fall were protecting something important in a nearby structure.

I witnessed one of the cursed [[Mawsworn]] steal a device by the door. The Elders say we should not meddle with artifacts, but would it be a transgression to recover what was stolen?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|87}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must do what we can to preserve this place, right?

==Completion==
This automa still lives! But it is so weak.

==Notes==
Kill [[Ilgaz the Plunderer]].
