==Objectives==
[[File:Warped Rift.png|thumb|Warped Rift.]]
Analyze 6 Warped Rifts.
*[[Warped Rift]]s analyzed (6)

==Description==
[[Devourer]]s are a problem. Rifts are a bigger problem.

They will keep bringing devourers. We must close them. To do this, we need information.

Take the [[:crescendal]]. Use it to analyze the rifts. Bring the information back to us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|25|74|}}
*8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do not break the crescendal. It can be... difficult to use.

==Completion==
[[File:Warped Rift - Analyzed.png|thumb|Once analyzed.]]
This information will help us. Tell us how to close the rifts. Fewer rifts means fewer devourers.

==Notes==
[[Warped Rift]]s are found throughout the area, with a [[Large Warped Rift]] being found near the [[Ancient Translocator]].

On accept, the player is followed by the [[Borrowed Crescendal]]:
:{{text|say|Olea Manu|We recently cleaned the crescendal. Keep it clean. Please.}}

On completion:
:{{text|say|Olea Manu|We will inspect the crescendal for dirt and viscera. Again. Just in case.}}

==Progression==
{{Jiro to Hero}}
