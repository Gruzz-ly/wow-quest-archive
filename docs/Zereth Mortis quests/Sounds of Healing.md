==Objectives==
Bring the Resonating Disc to [[Olea Manu]] at [[Faith's Repose]].
*[[Resonating Disc]] (provided)

==Description==
<You hear a soothing sound emanating from the disc as it hums softly.

Olea Manu might know more about this.>

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: {{Abilities|Resonating Disc|id=372788|icon=inv_shield_1h_hyrja_d_01}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
The Jailer is no more. What you bring is proof--Zereth Mortis is beginning to heal itself! You may find new tools born of that healing. Tools that resonate strongly with the Cyphers. With them, you can rid us of the remaining [[Mawsworn]].

==Notes==
Its placeholder name during PTR was '''Cypher Weapons Place Holder'''.
