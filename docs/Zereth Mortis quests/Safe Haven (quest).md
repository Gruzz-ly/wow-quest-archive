'''Safe Haven''' is an optional breadcrumb back to [[Haven]] offered after completing [[Souls Entwined]] in the [[Zereth Mortis campaign]].

==Objectives==
Report back to [[Bolvar Fordragon|Bolvar]] in [[Haven]].

==Description==
Let us return to [[Zereth Mortis]]. You should report back to Bolvar and tell him of what we have accomplished. We may have achieved this victory, but there is still much to be done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Completion==
A new [[Arbiter (title)|Arbiter]] has been established? This is excellent news, <name>, and a massive step towards restoring balance to the [[Shadowlands]]. Your efforts here will not be forgotten.

However, it is still only one step towards our goal. We must continue to strengthen our position in Zereth Mortis, and drive [[Zovaal|the Jailer]]'s forces out.

Our work continues--but with you on our side, victory is that much closer. Thank you.

==Notes==
Use the Exit Portal or talk to [[Tal-Inara]] to get back down to the [[Enclave]] if needed.
