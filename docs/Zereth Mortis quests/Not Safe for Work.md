==Objectives==
Assist Rana in her search and collect 8 Progenitor Relics.
*Escort [[Rana]] searching for relics (0/100%)
*[[Progenitor Relic]] (8)

==Description==
Rana's discovery of progenitor relics at the [[Ageless Shards]] has created quite a stir among the [[Enlightened]]. These relics predate our earlier discoveries, and through them we may gain a deeper understanding of the workings of [[Zereth Mortis]].

Rana is collecting the relics, but I fear she is in danger. Agents of [[Cartel Xy]] have been spotted in the area, and will likely attempt to steal the relics.

Please travel to the Ageless Shards, and help Rana collect the relics.

==Rewards==
* 8,150 [[XP]]

You will receive a combination of three from:
* 8 [[Anima Webbing]]
*19 - 26 [[Cyphers of the First Ones]]
* 75 [[Cosmic Flux]]
*[[Sandworn Relic]]
* {{cost|6|17|50}}

==Progress==
Have you collected the Progenitor Relics?

==Completion==
Your help is always appreciated, <name>.
