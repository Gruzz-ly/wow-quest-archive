*Follow Hanoa the Exile and listen to her story

I remember this metal. I saw it when I was touched by [[Maw]] [[magic]]. When I was severed...

I will show you where this happened. Follow me. I will tell you my story.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|6|43|50}}
*8,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is worse than I thought. Much worse.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|Let me know when you are ready.}}
:I was like the others. But the Maw came here. It changed me.
:{{Gossip|I am ready to go.}}
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|I will tell you what happened. I was in the cypher archive. Then the attack came.}}
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|Black steel chains pierced the veil. Made of the same metal you found in the cave.}}
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|Chains latched onto the archive. Ripped it out. Magic struck me. I escaped.}}
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|I felt the touch of the Maw. It spread over me. I began to feel strange.}}
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|I could not sense the other jiro. The Circle was gone. I was alone. Severed.}}
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|I returned to the Circle. They sent me away. I do not blame them. The Maw taint must not spread.}}
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|Here. This was the cypher archive. Now it is a scar on the land.}}
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|Devourers consume the magic of the land. They are unstable. Perhaps this is where they entered Zereth Mortis?}}

;Talking to [[Olea Pau]]
:We must remove devourers. There are no automa to help us. We must do this ourselves.

;Talking to [[Olea Novi]]
:Orbs create. But can do much more...

;Talking to [[Olea Manu]]
:Automa should have stopped devourers. But they did not. They are busy with something else. Something worse.

;Upon completion
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|This must be stopped! Does anyone have any ideas?}}

;Talking to Hanoa the Exile
:Devourers threaten the Circle. The Jiro must be protected. This is my task.
