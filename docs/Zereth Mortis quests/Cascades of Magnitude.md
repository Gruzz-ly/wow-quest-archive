==Objectives==
{{questportrait|E'rnee|Who knows what effect the water will have?}}
Experiment with waterfall water in [[Dimensional Falls]].
*Fill Water Beaker in Waterfall
*Throw Water on [[Scaphio]]
*Throw Water on [[E'rnee]]
*Hold off E'rnee

==Description==
Many of the creatures here at Dimensional Falls are particularly affected by the environment. Hmm... let us experiment with the waterfalls themselves!

We have seen unique effects from various natural components here in [[Zereth Mortis]]. Why not the water as well?

Collect some water, then sprinkle it on a creature in the Falls to see what happens.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These Falls must contain magic we cannot even comprehend.

==Completion==
That was unexpected.

==Notes==
;Upon dousing Scaphio The Magnificent in waterfall water, Scaphio shrinks
:{{Text|say|Tamra|That's it! The water from the falls shrinks the creatures!}}
:{{Text|say|Tamra|We figured it out--now let's use it on E'rnee!}}

;Upon dousing E'rnee with the waterfall water he grows larger and attacks you
:{{Text|say|Tamra|Oh no! He's even bigger now!}}
:{{Text|say|Tamra|Hold him back while I refill the water and we can try again!}}

;Upon defeating E'rnee he splits into many [[E'rnee Duplicate]]s and runs away
:{{Text|say|Tamra|E'rnee! What did the water do to you?}}

==Progression==
