==Objectives==
Complete the Fugueal Protolock.
*Complete the Cypher

==Description==
In order to aid my research you will need to decode various Progenitor cyphers like the Fugueal Protolock. This is a most difficult cypher, I will show you what you need to do.

==Rewards==
*You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|57|40}}
*5x [[Cyphers of the First Ones]]

==Progress==
Use this knowledge and collect more data from the field.

Well done, [[Maw Walker]]. That was truly an impressive effort.

Remember, that if you do struggle with these protolocks, your companion can help you overcome them if they have enough energy.

Now take your expanded knowledge out into the field.

;On accept
:{{Text|Say|Firim|The progenitor language has abnormally high information density. Take this cypher for example.}}
:{{Text|Say|Firim|As with other cyphers, you must deactivate all runes on the grid to access the information contained in the cypher.}}
:{{Text|Say|Firim|There are nine runes here. Clear the grid by making three valid phrases of three runes.}}
:{{Text|Say|Firim|Observe the nine displayed runes. Each has four different properties: the type of shape in its core, the number of those shapes in the core, the type of border shape, and the number of border shapes.}}
:{{Text|Say|Firim|Runes can only be cleared by selecting three of them to form a syntactically aligned phrase.}}
:{{Text|Say|Firim|Correctly aligned phrases contain three runes that are either all identical or all different in each of their four properties.}}

;Wrong match
*{{Text|Say|Firim|Not quite, see how the core shapes of two of the runes match; but the core shape of the third rune is different? Each rune must be either all identical or all different for each property.}}
*{{Text|Say|Firim|Not quite, see how the number of core shapes in two of the runes is the same; but the third rune has a different number of core shapes? Each rune must be either all identical or all different for each property.}}
*{{Text|Say|Firim|Not quite, see how the borders shapes of two of the runes are the same; but the third rune has a different border shape? Each rune must be either all identical or all different for each property.}}
*{{Text|Say|Firim|Not quite, see how the number of border shapes in two of the runes is the same; but the third rune has a different number of border shapes? Each rune must be either all identical or all different for each property.}}
*{{Text|Say|Firim|It appears that the final rules you have available don't make a valid phrase, you will need to restart the cypher and try again.}}

;Correct match
*{{Text|Say|Firim|Correct.}}

;Completing the puzzle
:{{Text|Say|Firim|A satisfactory outcome.}}
:{{Text|Say|Firim|You have completed the task.}}
