Hmmmmm...

My friend, I am nearly out of ideas. We have exhausted most of [[Zereth Mortis]]' supply of tempting flavors.

I have spent hours pondering the things I find enticing. Only one thing outside of Zereth Mortis brushes my memory:

Sweet organic melons. 

My dear friend once sold them just inside the great [[Tazavesh]] marketplace. Is it possible they are still there? You will need to gain access to the city, if you have not already.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. This is a piece of a past long lost and forgotten...

But it is not for me. Let us see if this at last will attract our hidden [[bufonid]] friend.
