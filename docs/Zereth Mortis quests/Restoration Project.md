'''Restoration Project''' begins "Starting Over", the seventh and penultimate chapter of the [[Zereth Mortis campaign]]. Players can alternatively start the questline with [[A Monumental Discovery]], an optional breadcrumb from [[Haven]].

==Objectives==
Speak with Saezurah.
*Speak to [[Saezurah]]
*Hear [[Pelagos]] out

==Description==
Without an [[Arbiter (title)|Arbiter]], the very purpose of the [[Shadowlands]] has been compromised. [[Soul]]s flood the [[Maw]] with no direction.

As Saezurah noted, Zereth Mortis would ordinarily craft a new being to take the Arbiter's place. I suspect [[the Jailer]]'s [[Mawsworn|forces]] have disrupted the land to the point where this is no longer possible.

It is time to take action ourselves, and bring stability again to the Shadowlands! Speak to Saezurah, and see where we must begin.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you spoken with them?

==Completion==
The covenants are certain to send aid if we ask.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Firim|A new Arbiter... to think I will observe something of this magnitude!}}

Talk to Saezurah:
:The cycle has been broken. An eternal song stirs, but the threads must be woven.
:{{Gossip|How do we help Zereth Mortis create a new Arbiter?}}
:''Saezurah floats over to the [[Vessel]].''
:{{Text|say|Saezurah|A symphony of creation needs voices joined in chorus. One, we possess. The other, we do not.}}
:{{Text|say|Saezurah|The vessel seeks a soul. One that slumbers in the [[Crypts of the Eternal]]. Only with both will the Arbiter sing again.}}
:{{Text|say|Pelagos|The Crypts of the Eternal--but that area is overrun by Mawsworn! How are we to get past them on our own?}}
:{{Text|say|Kleia|We are not alone, Pelagos. Surely the [[covenant]]s will aid us toward the creation of a new Arbiter.}}
