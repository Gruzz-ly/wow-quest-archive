==Objectives==
Kill 15 creatures within the [[Untamed Verdure]].
*Untamed enemies slain (15)

==Description==
This place was abandoned for too long. The vegetation has overtaken the land.

We must enter the [[Blooming Foundry]] to fix it.

Until then: clear the area. Remove the deviants who have grown twisted over time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This is all wrong.

We will start from the beginning.

==Completion==
This is a good start.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|The overgrowth of the land gave rise to aberrant creatures in the area.}}
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|Destroy elementals, cores, creatures, and automa covered with flora.}}

;As you move around the area
:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|All of these beasts are covered with plants, too. How are they moving?}}
:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|I sense something ancient and powerful by those strange creatures!}}

;Upon approaching an Abandoned Automa
:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|How long do you think this creature wandered before it stopped moving here?}}

;Upon completion and speaking to Koh Shira
:This place was never meant to look like this.
:The land grew wild and unkempt without our help.
:We will fix this.
