==Objectives==
[[File:Cervid Grazer.png|thumb|[[Cervid Grazer]]]]
[[File:Outmoded Servitor.png|thumb|[[Outmoded Servitor]]]]
Test the [[:Broken Helm]] on creatures in [[Zereth Mortis]].
*Helm Tested on [[Native Poultrid]]s (3)
*Helm Tested on [[Cervid]]s (3)
*Helm Tested on [[Outmoded Servitor]] (2)
*Meet Elder Eru near the Lexical Glade.

==Description==
The creatures of Zereth Mortis have existed here since well before I created [[Domination]].

We have seen the effects that [[Zovaal]]'s [[Mawsworn|forces]] have had on them, but I believe there is more to be learned.

Use the helm on the denizens of Zereth Mortis and see what you can uncover about a natural resistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Enlightened]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Progress==
You have an object that wields Domination, yet you are not overcome? Interesting.

==Completion==
The more advanced creatures resist Domination for longer?

Well of course, I could have told you that. It's all about [[Language of the First Ones|the language]]!

==Notes==
On accept, the player gets the same buff:
:{{Abilities|Helm of Domination|Holding a piece of the broken Helm of Domination.|icon=achievement_boss_lichking}}

...and Extra Action Button as before:
:{{Abilities|Domination|Test the power of the broken Helm.|notes=20 yd range. Channeled.|icon=achievement_boss_lichking}}

Using the helm on [[Native Poultrid]]s causes them to explode and die instantly.

Using the helm on [[Cervid Grazer]]s or [[Cervid Protector]]s causes them to become Aggravated, grow in size, and attack:
:{{Abilities|Aggravated|Affected by the Broken Helm of Domination, increasing damage taken by 100% and increasing damage done by 100%.|icon=spell_animamaw_debuff}}

They then need to be killed in order to grant quest credit.

[[Outmoded Servitor]]s are located on the other side of the zone, in the [[Lexical Glade]] near Elder Eru. Using the helm on them causes a slightly different reaction:
:{{Text|say|Outmoded Servitor|{{Proglan|color=y|3}}?}}
:{{Text|say|Outmoded Servitor|... {{Proglan|color=y|15}}}}
:{{Text|say|Outmoded Servitor|{{Proglan|color=y|24}}!}}

If your Cypher of the First Ones knowledge is sufficiently upgraded, the Outdmoded Servitor dialogue will be translated as follows
:{{Text|say|Outmoded Servitor|??}}
:{{Text|say|Outmoded Servitor|... .}}
:{{Text|say|Outmoded Servitor|!!}}

They then become Aggravated and attack just like the cervids.

Upon talking to Elder Eru
:Welcome to this little corner of creation.
