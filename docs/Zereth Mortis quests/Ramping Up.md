==Objectives==
Activate 4 conductors within the [[Blooming Foundry]].
*[[Neglected Conductor|Conductors]] activated (4)

==Description==
We must restore the Foundry's power to use it. Conductors will channel power so we can use it.

We know how to use the conductors. Clear the way, and we shall start over.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
These automa should not act like this.

They are beautiful. Strange. New.

We must deliberate before continuing.

==Notes==
;Upon acceptance and talking to Koh Shira
:The Foundry is open!
:We shall see what needs to be fixed.

;Upon activating the first Neglected Conductor
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|Conductor activating...}}
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|Strange. The automa have been using this conductor.}}

;Talking to Koh Shira after activating the firrst Neglected Conductor
:The Blooming Foundry controls this area. It has power enough to burn it all. 
:We can start over.

;Upon activating the second Neglected Conductor
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|Accessing conductor...}}
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|The automa also used this conductor...}}

;Upon activating the third Neglected Conductor
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|Accessing conductor...}}
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|The Foundry considered a reset and chose against it. What does that mean?}}

;Upon activating the fourth Neglected Conductor
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|Accessing conductor...}}
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|Does the Foundry want to keep these flawed automa alive?}}

;Talking to Koh Shira
:We accomplished so much together.
:We are proud of Circle Koh. Proud of you.
:{{Gossip|So... what's next?}}
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|These automa have changed on their own. Grown past their creation.}}
:{{Text|say|Koh Riva|They are not an error. They are something new.}}
:{{Text|say|Koh Tissa|We will watch them. Learn. use the Foundry to help them.}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|We thought the Foundry was distrupted and these automa were broken.}}
:{{Text|say|Koh Riva|We were wrong. These automa evolved.}}
:{{Text|say|Koh Tissa|If they are something new, we must respect it.}}
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|We shall obserce, learn... and help them.}}
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|The constructor!}}
:{{Text|say|Koh Tissa|We will stop it.}}
