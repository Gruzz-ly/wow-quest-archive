==Objectives==
Gather 10 Suspicious Papers.
*[[Suspicious Papers]] (10)

==Description==
We cannot see them, but I am certain this is where [[Cartel Xy]] has established their base.

Something must have drawn Xy to this area of [[Zereth Mortis]] specifically, and we must discover what it is if we are to protect our friends here.

Their cloaks do not cover their supplies very well. See what information you can gather from their belongings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must discover Cartel Xy's intentions here.

==Completion==
Oh, they thought they could hide their plans with a code? Hold on, my friend, this should take just a moment...

==Notes==
