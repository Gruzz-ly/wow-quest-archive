==Description==
Hello, my friend!

An expedition of [[Cartel Al]] was sent in search of this place long ago, and was believed lost. I entered [[Zereth Mortis]] in hopes of saving my splintered [[cartel]] from the dangers of the [[Maw]] that have preceded me.

At last, I have found my old friend! And yet, she refuses to return to safety.

Perhaps others can be convinced. Will you try?

Have any others chosen to leave?

If they cannot be persuaded, they must be protected.

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Al'dalil|Why did you not return to us? Why remain in this place?}}
:{{Text|say|Rana|This place of wonder? This place of beauty?}}

;Speaking to Avna
:The [[First Ones]] guide our path through their constructs.
:Look at [[Bud]]. Seated. Calm. Watching the birds and the [[bufonid]]s.
:Bud is the wisest of us.
:{{Gossip|Your Cartel Al friends miss you.}}
:{{Text|say|Avna|They, and you, are welcome to join Bud and I in our ornithological endeavors.}}

;Speaking to Varoun
:The [[vombata]] are gentle, kind creatures. It was they who approached us when we first arrived. We are honored by their companionship.
:{{Gossip|The portal to [[Oribos]] is open.}}
:{{Text|say|Varoun|Yes, and so? I could never leave my vombata friends.}}

;Speaking to Custodian Kalir
:Watch your step, mortal.
:{{Gossip|Don't you know that you're in danger here?}}
