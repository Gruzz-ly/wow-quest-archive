==Objectives==
Pick an automa construct and use it against the Mawsworn.

*[[Automa]] chosen

The presence of [[the Jailer]]'s forces at [[Provis Strata]] have{{Sic}} been causing untold damage to the region. If left unchecked, we will lose all knowledge in the area.

One of our kin has prepared some automa to deal with the Mawsworn. Meet with them, and fight back against those who would disrespect [[Zereth Mortis]] in this manner.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|6|17|50}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is the task complete?

==Completion==
Good work.

==Notes==
Choose [[Automa Protector]], [[Automa Mender]], or [[Automa Harrier]] and kill [[Ebon Chainguard]]s, [[Dreadlord Commander]]s, [[Mawsworn Torturer (Zereth Mortis)|Mawsworn Torturers]], [[Ebon Deadeye]]s, [[Ebon Dominator]]s, and [[Discordant Sentry]].

;Talking to Custodian Taj
:We have procured a few of the more rudimentary automata to aid you in the efforts against the forces of the Jailer.
:They each have their own specialties. Take the one you believe will work with you the best.
