==Objectives==
Lift 4 Mawsteel Shards and throw them off the cliffs.
*[[Mawsteel Shard]]s tossed off cliff (4)

==Description==
[[Zereth Mortis]] is sacred. Rifts should not form here. Something creates them.

The metal you found has [[Maw]] [[magic]]. [[Devourer]]s use it to make rifts. This is how they skirt our protections.

Mawsteel shards are strewn across the area. Take these shards. Throw them off our cliffs. Make sure devourers do not use them to create rifts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Are the shards gone?

==Completion==
Removing mawsteel prevents rifts. It is not much but it will help.

==Notes==
On accept: 
:{{text|say|Olea Novi|The shards are heavy. Be careful.}}

The Toss Mawsteel Shard extra action button appears when on a cliff.

On completion:
:{{text|say|Olea Novi|We appreciate the heavy lifting.}}
