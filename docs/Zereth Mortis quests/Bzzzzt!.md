==Objectives==
Use the [[enlightened]] [[broker]] device to remove the progenitor debris from [[vespoid]] nests.
*Debris retrieved (30)
*[[Zephyreal Generator]] (provided)

==Description==
The vespoids of the region use debris in the area to form the core of their nests. While this is normally something we'd allow them to naturally do, they've started taking some of the relics we were studying.

I have a device that should hopefully allow for the removal of such relics from their hives without damaging the core structure. Use it to retrieve these relics.

==Rewards==
You will receive a combination of three from:
*[[Cypher Equipment]]
* 9 [[Anima Webbing]]
* 21 - 30 [[Cyphers of the First Ones]]
* 75 [[Cosmic Flux]]
*{{Cost|253|26}}
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[The Enlightened]]

==Progress==
How much have you retrieved?

==Completion==
That is enough for now, thank you.

==Notes==
Use the Zephyreal Generator on [[Vespoid Nest]]s.

==Patch changes==
