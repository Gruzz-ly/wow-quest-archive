==Objectives==
Charge and cleanse the progenitor orb.
*Charge the [[Progenitor Orb]] (0/100%)
*Progenitor Orb purified

==Description==
The forces of [[Zovaal]] have been spreading their malign influence into the natural life within [[Provis Fauna]]. With the rate of their corruption, attempting to cleanse them one by one would be ill advised.

Instead, we can just return their energies into the systems of [[Zereth Mortis]] to be used to create new fauna. Use this orb, let it absorb their energy as they die, and then cleanse it once it has been charged.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|6|17|50}}
* 4 [[Sandworn Relic]]
* 18 [[Cyphers of the First Ones]]
* 75 [[Cosmic Flux]]
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you finished?

==Completion==
Their energy will serve the cycle.

==Notes==
Objectives include [[Mawtouched Grazer]]s, [[Mawtouched Animate]]s, [[Mawtouched Avian]]s, and [[Mawtouched Bull]]s.

==Patch changes==
