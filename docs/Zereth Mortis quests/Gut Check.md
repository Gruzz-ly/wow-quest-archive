==Objectives==
Collect a Crescendal from an [[Insatiable Breaker]] or a [[Voracious Stalker]] at the [[Terrace of Formation]].
*[[Crescendal]]

==Description==
The crescendal is a powerful tool created by [[automa]]. They are given to [[jiro]] when work is hard or important. When the [[devourer]]s attacked, crescendals were likely... eaten.

Crescendals are strong. They do not easily damage. Check the stomachs of bigger devourers. Perhaps find one intact?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We have very few crescendals. It is important to recover one.

==Completion==
<The jiro looks over the guts-spattered device.>

Not ideal. But mostly intact... it will need cleaning.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Olea Manu|Remember! Kill the devourer before searching innards.}}

Kill [[Insatiable Breaker]] and [[Voracious Stalker]] until the [[Crescendal]] drops.

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Olea Manu|The crescendal's hover ability works. This is good.}}

==Progression==
{{Jiro to Hero}}
