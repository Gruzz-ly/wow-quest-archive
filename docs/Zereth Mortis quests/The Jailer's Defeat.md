'''The Jailer's Defeat''' begins the optional final chapter of the [[Zereth Mortis campaign]], "Judgment".

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Bolvar Fordragon|Bolvar]] to relive the victory against the Jailer.
*Witness [[Zovaal|the Jailer]]'s defeat{{Co|35|64.76|Zereth Mortis}}

==Description==
At long last, we have thwarted the Jailer's schemes.

Both the [[Forge of Afterlives]] and [[Azeroth]]'s [[Azeroth (titan)|world-soul]] have been restored, and the [[Shadowlands]] can now begin to recover from the [[anima]] drought.

I know it is in your nature to push ever forward. But this was a monumental victory, and it deserves a moment of reflection.

==Progress==
Have you witnessed the defeat of the Jailer?

==Completion==
A new era for the Shadowlands begins today.

==Notes==
When the player becomes eligible to receive this quest, Bolvar will say the following when approached in Haven:
:{{Text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|[[Maw Walker]]. We have much to discuss.}}

Speak to Bolvar again:
:The battle was arduous, but in the end we emerged victorious.
:{{Gossip|<Witness the Jailer's defeat.>}}

This causes the [[The Jailer (tactics)#Closing cinematic|The Jailer's Fall]] cinematic to play.

After this quest, the player permanently unlocks the option to view the cinematic again by talking to Bolvar.
