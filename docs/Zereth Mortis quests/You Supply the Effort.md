==Objectives==
Locate 10 Enlightened Provisions from chests, nests, relics and other containers about [[Zereth Mortis]].
*[[Enlightened Provisions]] (10)

==Description==
The gear I provide is made available by the blessings of the [[First Ones]] and the... efforts of many other travelers.

Each of us needs to provide for those that will follow later.

Collect what provisions you come across in your exploration of Zereth Mortis. Keep a sharp eye out--they may be hidden in mysterious places. Return them here to me. I will in turn provide them to future travelers.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[The Enlightened]]

==Progress==
What have you found for me?

==Completion==
Well met, traveler! What have you found there? Ah, this will help many other travelers in need. You have my thanks--and theirs as well.
