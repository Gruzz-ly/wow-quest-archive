;Upon moving up the path with Glimmercane, they provide some dialogue
:{{Text|say|Glimercane|I sense immense power, just up that hill!}}
:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|All the plants here are growing at a rapid pace! It's so nice.}}
:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|Everything here feels familiar... yet strange. Kinda like dunking your head into a pond and opening your eyes, y'know?}}

;Upon moving closer to [[Koh Shira]]
:{{Text|say|Koh Shira|Are you here to assist us?}}
