==Objectives==
Deliver 8 wrangled Wild Proto Avians and slay 6 Soul-Parched Gorgers and 2 Reality Breachers in [[Provis Esper]].
*[[Proto Wrangler Rope|Ropes]] collected
*[[Wild Proto Avian]] [[Proto Avian Cage|delivered]] (8)
*[[Soul-Parched Gorger]] slain (6)
*[[Reality Breacher]] slain (2)

==Description==
Devourers have disrupted the avians nesting at Provis Esper.

This may be our last chance to examine them before they become tainted, like the others.

Capture several of the avians at Provis Esper and return them to [[Pilgrim Arizh]] for relocation and study. Deal with any problems that get in your way.

==Rewards==
* {{cost|272|37}}
* 9 [[Sandworn Relic]]
* 21 [[Cyphers of the First Ones]]
* 75 [[Cosmic Flux]]

==Progress==
We cannot allow the works of the First Ones to become twisted.

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. The avians will be moved to a safer location where we can observe them.
