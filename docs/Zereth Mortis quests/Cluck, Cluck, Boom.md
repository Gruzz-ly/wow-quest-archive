Use the Kinematic Micro-Life Recalibrator to "recalibrate" Malfunctioned Poultrids in the [[Great Veldt]].
*[[Malfunctioned Poultrid]] "Recalibrated" (10)
*[[Kinematic Micro-Life Recalibrator]] (provided)

==Description==
The endemic [[poultrid]]s of [[Zereth Mortis]] have been influenced in an unseemly way by all these invaders.

*[[Anima Webbing]]
*[[Sandworn Relic]]
*[[Cypher Equipment]]
*75 [[Cosmic Flux]]
*19 - 22 [[Cyphers of the First Ones]]

==Progress==
These mysterious ways must be understood.

==Completion==
Those poultrid do make quite a mess. Thank you for your assistance.
