==Description==
When the [[Mawsworn]] came to [[Zereth Mortis]], they brought [[mawrat]]s with them!

A swarm of their mawrats overran my cave, making off with many of our research items!

Rana is assembling a team to help recover the items. Meet up with her and aid in the effort.

You will receive:
* 9 [[Anima Webbing]]
* 32 [[Cyphers of the First Ones]]
* 75 [[Cosmic Flux]]
* {{cost|6|17|50}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you dealt with those mawrats?

==Completion==
A most excellent effort! I had feared these items lost for good.

==Notes==
