==Objectives==
[[File:Motivated Automa.jpg|thumb|Motivated Automa]]
Return 6 Motivated Automa to Firim.
*[[Motivated Automa]] returned to [[Firim]] (6){{Co|55.87|29.9|Zereth Mortis}}
*[[Firim's Motivator]] (provided)

==Description==
Giants litter these sands, mortal. But I believe we can revitalize them.

The smaller [[automa]] that are hiding in the desert can be utilized here. Use my Motivator to rally them to our cause. If we can gather enough, their energy can replenish these defeated behemoths to bolster our forces.

Return as many as you can to me, and we will put them to work!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Progress==
Have they been suitably motivated?

==Completion==
Well done, mortal! Soon we shall see the results of your efforts.

==Notes==
On accept, Firim, [[Kbato]], and the [[Motivated Servitor]] move down the road. Kbato and the Servitor join the band of covenant troops, while Firim plants a circle on the ground around a [[Controlled Automa Shell]]. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Firim|Bring the automa cores to me. They can power the behemoths you see before you.}}

[[Confused Automa]] lie half-buried in the sand throughout the area. Interact with them to turn them into Motivated Automa and then bring them to the circle to turn them in and cause them to jump into the Controlled Automa Shell's sphere. Upon the first turn-in:
:{{Text|say|Firim|With enough automa, we can vanquish the Mawsworn!}}

On completion:
:{{Text|say|Firim|Excellent! This plan will almost certainly succeed!}}

Upon completing all three quests' objectives, [[Secutor Mevix|Mevix]], [[Nadjia the Mistblade|Nadjia]], [[Hunt-Captain Korayn|Korayn]], and [[Tactician Sakaa|Sakaa]] spawn at the front of the band of covenant troops.
