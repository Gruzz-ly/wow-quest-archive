==Objectives==
[[File:Prisoner of Interest - crowds.jpg|thumb|The crowded Ring of Fates]]
Speak to [[Uther the Lightbringer|Uther]] in [[Oribos]] to escort [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] to [[Pelagos|the Arbiter]].

==Description==
With [[Zovaal|the Jailer]] defeated, we must now turn our attention to healing the wounds he inflicted upon the [[Shadowlands]]. That process begins with Sylvanas Windrunner.

Though she proved instrumental to our victory, the terrible atrocities she committed have been neither forgotten nor forgiven. She is to face the new Arbiter's judgment in Oribos.

Uther awaits you in the [[Ring of Fates]]. Together, you will escort Sylvanas to the [[Crucible (Oribos)|Crucible]].

==Completion==
Word of Sylvanas's arrival has spread throughout the Shadowlands. Many wish to see her pay for her crimes.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Highlord Bolvar Fordragon|I shall deliver the [[Crown of Wills]] to the Arbiter. Then we will bear witness to the fate of Sylvanas Windrunner.}}

Head back to Oribos the normal way. The Ring of Fates is in a special phase: crowds of angrily shouting and untargetable covenant members ([[Apprentice Ritualist]]s, [[Kyrian Aspirant]]s, [[Sylvari Artisan]]s, and [[Venthyr Aristocrat]]s) and souls (mainly [[Night Elf Soul]]s but also a few [[Orc Soul]]s) flock around the edges of the central ring, held off by untargetable [[attendant]] protectors. Uther and Sylvanas are waiting on the north side of the [[Soul Pillar]]. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Uther|Be warned. Their words will be harsh.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|I expect no less.}}
