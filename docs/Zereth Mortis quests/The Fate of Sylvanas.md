==Objectives==
Speak to Pelagos to witness the judgment of [[Sylvanas Windrunner]].
*Speak to [[Pelagos]]{{Co|68.4|49.5|Oribos|3}}

==Description==
The time has come.

Let this bring the dark saga of Sylvanas Windrunner to a close and herald a new dawn for the [[Shadowlands]].

Speak to me, and we will begin.

==Completion==
How could I possibly pass judgment to [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande's]] satisfaction when she and [[Night elf|her people]] were the ones most wronged by the Banshee Queen?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Arbiter Pelagos|Let us begin.}}

Talk to Pelagos again:
:All that remains is for judgement to be passed.
:{{Gossip|<Witness the Arbiter's judgement.>}}

A real-time cutscene plays.

:''Sylvanas walks through the middle of the crowd toward Pelagos. She steals a look at Tyrande, [[Shandris]], and [[Maiev]], who glare back at her. She comes to a stop before the Arbiter.''
:{{Text|say|Arbiter Pelagos|There can be no true justice without compassion...}}
:{{Text|say|Arbiter Pelagos|and I can see your deeds bear the mark of [[the Jailer]]'s influence.}}
:''Pelagos looks at the projections of [[Kyrestia]] and the [[Winter Queen]] beside him.''
:{{Text|say|Arbiter Pelagos|An influence we failed to contain.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|The Jailer did not control me.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|My actions were mine alone and I accept their consequences.}}
:{{Text|say|Arbiter Pelagos|Then... you know in your heart, to whom you must answer.}}
:''Sylvanas turns around and looks in Tyrande's direction.''
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|I submit to the judgment...}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|of Tyrande Whisperwind.}}
:''A few gasps are heard from the crowd and several of the Onlookers make confused gestures.''

:{{Text|say|Arbiter Pelagos|Are there any gathered here who object to this fate?}}
:''The camera cuts to [[Anduin]] looking conflicted before glancing down, while [[Jaina]] and [[Thrall]] beside him look away. The camera cuts back to the Arbiter.''
:{{Text|say|Arbiter Pelagos|So be it.}}
:''Tyrande walks out of the crowd to Sylvanas and raises her blade against Sylvanas' throat.''
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|What game do you play now, Banshee?}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|The Sylvanas I hunted would never submit to the blade of her enemy.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|Death would be a merciful end, Tyrande.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|And I do not expect your mercy.}}
:''Tyrande lowers her blade.''
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Your newfound remorse might be genuine...}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|but it can never erase all you have done.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|There will be no peace for you, Windrunner...}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|until there is peace for the [[soul]]s of your victims.}}

:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Bring her!}}
