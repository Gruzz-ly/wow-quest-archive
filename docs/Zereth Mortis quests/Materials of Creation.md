==Objectives==
Collect 10 Eidolic Fragments and 300 Trace Enigment.
*[[Eidolic Fragment]] (10)
*[[Minor Enigmet]] (300)
*[[Firim's Forge-Tap]] (provided)

==Description==
The large metal spheres that litter the landscape of [[Zereth Mortis]] are spent forges, discarded during the creation process.

The spheres near the [[Forge of Afterlives]] contain trace amounts of materials unique to that location.

I have modified a Forge-Tap to harvest those materials. Use it near the forges I have identified. The rare Eidolic Particles have the greatest chance to be foun on the largest of [[Progenitor Forge]]s.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|6|17|50}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you collected what we need?

==Completion==
I shall make use of these immediately. These will help Saezurah and the automa resist the effects of the domination magic.

==Notes==
Use [[Firim's Forge-Tap]] on orbs found near the [[Forge of Afterlives]].

==Patch changes==
