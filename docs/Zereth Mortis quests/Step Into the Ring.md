==Objectives==
Defeat Generated creations the [[Nexus of Actualization]].
*[[Sequence Generator|Start]] the Sequence
*Generated creations defeated (3)

==Description==
One of the remarkable things we have found about these lands is that they seem to be adaptive and changing, even as ancient as they are. Things are not stationary.

In the depths of the Nexus of Actualization there is a forge that appears made to test these various designs, and to learn. These creatures may one day be used to defend [[Zereth Mortis]] from threats, so you should test their effectiveness where possible.

Go there, challenge what the forge creates and report back to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive a combination of three from:
*[[Anima Webbing]]
*[[Cypher Equipment]]
*[[Sandworn Relic]]
*20 - 31 [[Cyphers of the First Ones]]
*75x [[Cosmic Flux]]

==Progress==
Change is the engine of creation.

==Completion==
What a remarkable device. Of course there is clearly some improvement to be made in what it creates. But perhaps it will learn from the lessons you have provided.

==Notes==
Kill [[Generated Dire Vombata]], [[Generated Oracle]], [[Generated Bulwark]], [[Generated Shapesmith]], or [[Generated Automental]].
