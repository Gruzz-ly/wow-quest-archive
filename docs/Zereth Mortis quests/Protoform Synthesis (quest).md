This quest can be started after [[Daelic Understanding]] has been researched at the [[Cypher Console]].

==Objectives==
Escort [[Pocopoc]] to the Protoform [[Synthesis Forge]].
*Locate the Synthesis Forge chamber
*Enter the Synthesis Forge chamber

==Description==
<Pocopoc jumps around anxiously. When you completed your research into the basics of Dealic, it got very excited and it is urging you to follow it somewhere else in this realm.>

==Rewards==
You will learn: [[Protoform Synthesis (Battle Pet)]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Pocopoc looks between you and the console excitedly.>

==Completion==
<Pocopoc points to some controls on this device, and you understand just enough Dealic to glimpse its purpose in bringing you here. With some materials found across Zereth Mortis and Pocopoc's help, you can trigger this machine to create fully realized beings based on specific schematics.>

==Notes==
After completion, the [[Synthesis Forge]] can now be used to grant access to the [[Protoform Synthesis]] system.
