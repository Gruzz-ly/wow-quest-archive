==Objectives==
Travel to Provis Esper.
*Investigate [[Provis Esper]]
*Search the Ruined Locrian Technician

==Description==
The waters of the Wellspring no longer flow.

The designs of the First Ones have never before failed us. The pilgrims are beginning to wonder... are the First Ones displeased?

Certainly they may question, but MY faith remains steadfast. And as I expected, it seems the First Ones have sent us a solution.

You, of course.

Ancient research and texts indicate that the source of the wellspring is in an underground temple in Provis Esper. Go, I have faith that you will restore the Wellspring.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]

==Completion==
<This [[automa]] has been ravaged by [[devourer]]s. It clutches a curious object in its hand.>

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{Text|Say|[[Nadir]]|Esteemed Conservator, your faith is unwavering. But if this mortal is truly part of the designs of the First Ones... I wish to wtiness this with my own eyes. Please, let me accompany them.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Olem]]|Faith does not require proof, Nadir. But if proof is truly what you seek, I will not stop you from accompanying the mortal.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Nadir]]|Thank you, Esteemed One.}}
:{{Text|Say|[[Nadir]]|Mortal, I will meet you at the gate when you are ready.}}

;On approach to Provis Esper
:{{Text|Say|[[Nadir]]|I do not lack faith, stranger. I simply find it difficult to believe the First Ones would send a mortal, of all creatures, to aid us.}}

;Upon approaching the Ruined Locrian Technician
:{{Text|Say|[[Nadir]]|I recognize this automa. It is from Locrian Esper--the temple. But this place is crawling with devourers!}}

==PTR version==
;Description
:All deserve to bask in the grace of the [[First Ones]]. However, recent events have made that impossible!

:The [[Wellspring of the First Ones]] has gone dry. This has never before happened. The lost [[soul]]s who visit this site fear the First Ones have forsaken us, although my faith remains steadfast.

:Perhaps you can help restore this Wellspring? I have never seen it myself, but our research indicates the source is in an underground temple in Provis Esper.

;On accept
:{{Text|Say|[[Nadir]]|Let me accompany them, Esteemed Conservator, and ensure that the sanctity of the First Ones is observed.}}
:{{Text|Say|Olem|Your bravery honors the First Ones, but this trial belongs to the mortal.}}

;On complete
:{{Text|Say|Assistant Conservator Nadir|I recognize this automa. It is from Locrian Esper! The devourers must be after the Wellspring's power source.}}
:{{Text|Say|Assistant Conservator Nadir|What is it clutching in its hand? It must be important.}}
