[[File:Zereth Mortis loading screen.png|thumb|Zereth Mortis]]

The '''Zereth Mortis campaign''' covers the storylines added in [[patch 9.2]] as the concluding portion of the overarching [[Shadowlands campaign]], tracked in the achievements [[Secrets of the First Ones]] and [[From A to Zereth]]. The quests take place almost exclusively in the new zone of [[Zereth Mortis]].

==Unlocking the campaign==
[[File:Call of the Primus.jpg|thumb|The Primus' gathering in Oribos]]
To unlock this campaign, characters must have finished the first three chapters of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]], ending with [[Good News, Everyone!]]. Once that is done, [[Call of the Primus]] will be offered automatically as soon as players log in after [[patch 9.2]] goes live.

The main campaign chapters were initially time-gated after the release of the patch, with chapters 1-3 being available at launch and with one additional chapter unlocking each subsequent week. Since then, all of the chapters can be played through from start to finish without interruptions or additional requirements.

==Main campaign: Secrets of the First Ones==
[[File:WorldMap-ZerethMortis.jpg|thumb|Zereth Mortis map]]
The primary campaign is eight chapters long and covers the heroes' arrival to [[Zereth Mortis]], their search for a way to follow [[Zovaal|the Jailer]] into the [[Sepulcher of the First Ones]] and defeat him, the creation of a new [[Arbiter (title)|Arbiter]] to restore balance to the [[Shadowlands|realms of Death]] as a whole, and finally the ultimate fate of [[Sylvanas Windrunner]].

===Into the Unknown===
[[File:A Hasty Voyage - end.jpg|thumb|Entering Zereth Mortis]]
The [[Primus]] summons the Maw Walker to [[Oribos]], where the [[attendant]]s create a new [[sigil]] of the [[Arbiter (title)|Arbiter]] and open a portal to Zereth Mortis to pursue the Jailer. [[Pelagos]] of the [[kyrian]] volunteers to accompany the Maw Walker. However, a [[Mawsworn]] attack disables the portal and leaves the Maw Walker and Pelagos stranded in Zereth Mortis. In exchange for helping him obtain a strange [[automa]] core, the [[broker]] [[Firim]] leads the two to the [[Enlightened]] in [[Haven]]. After the Maw Walker earns the brokers' trust by defending them from the Mawsworn, [[Elder Ara]] helps open an [[Ancient Waystone]], establishing a permanent connection between Zereth Mortis and Oribos and allowing the Maw Walker's allies to join them.

===We Battle Onward===
[[File:Fighting for the Forge - end.jpg|thumb|Jaina and Baine at the Forge of Afterlives]]
[[Bolvar Fordragon|Bolvar]] sends the Maw Walker, [[Shandris Feathermoon]], and [[Darion Mograine]] to find out what the Mawsworn are up to near the [[Forge of Afterlives]]. They discover that the Jailer is converting automa with [[Domination]] magic to weaken the Forge's defenses and that the covenant forces have been infiltrated by [[nathrezim]]. In a duel with [[Mal'Ganis]], [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]], [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]], and the Maw Walker learn that the Jailer and Anduin are headed for the Forge. They arrive too late to stop the Jailer from using the Forge to enter the Sepulcher of the First Ones, taking Anduin with him.

===Forming an Understanding===
[[File:Security Measures end.jpg|thumb|Firim and Pelagos with the unconscious oracle]]
Pelagos and the Maw Walker head to the [[Genesis Fields]] to deal with the other major threat to Zereth Mortis, the [[devourer]]s. They hear [[Saezurah|an automa oracle]]'s call for help, but they arrive too late and she falls unconscious. The Enlightened refuse to help, so Pelagos and the Maw Walker bring the oracle to Firim in [[Exile's Hollow]]. The automa core from earlier reacts to the oracle and turns into [[Pocopoc]], a tiny automa who bonds with the Maw Walker, granting them the [[Summon Pocopoc]] ability and access to the [[Cypher of the First Ones]]. In addition, completing this chapter gives players access to Zereth Mortis' world quests and daily quests.

===Forging a New Path===
[[File:Nip It in the Bud end.jpg|thumb|Enlightened and venthyr attacking the Catalyst Gardens]]
[[File:The Pilgrimage Ends.jpg|thumb|Jaina, Uther, Sylvanas, and Bolvar outside the Sepulcher]]
[[Uther the Lightbringer|Uther]] shows up in Haven with the news that Sylvanas has awakened back in Oribos. Bolvar is more concerned with finding a way into the Sepulcher. Elder Ara lends her help by taking the Maw Walker on a pilgrimage: first to [[Provis Esper]] to find some First One artifacts, then to [[Pilgrim's Grace]] to learn more about them, the [[Catalyst Gardens]] to repair them (and deal with haywire automa), and finally back to Pilgrim's Grace to use them to activate the [[Ancient Translocator]] between the Sepulcher and the mainland, giving players access to the physical raid entrance. Uther convinces the others to accept Sylvanas' help in saving Anduin from the Jailer, and they head into the Sepulcher to do so.

===Crown of Wills===
[[File:One Half of the Equation.jpg|thumb|Taelia, Bolvar, and Darion in the Endless Sands]]
[[File:Forge of Domination - gathering.jpg|thumb|Preparing to forge a new crown]]
This chapter takes place after the first eight boss encounters of the Sepulcher, but does not require any raid progress to access.

The heroes bring Anduin to Haven in the hopes that he knows how to counter the Jailer's Domination magic, but he has no answers to give. The automa seem to be more resistant to Domination, however, so the Maw Walker is sent to experiment with the [[Helm of Domination]] and finds out that the automa's resistance stems from the [[Cypher of the First Ones|language of the First Ones]]. The Maw Walker, Bolvar, and [[Taelia Fordragon|Taelia]] head to the [[Endless Sands]] to collect First One phrases, after which those who've suffered from Domination in the past meet up in [[Bastion]] to uncover their memories of what helped them defy it. The Primus gathers the group in the [[Runecarver's Oubliette]] and uses the cyphers and memories to reforge the helm into the [[Crown of Wills]], giving the Maw Walker and their allies a way to resist the Jailer's power.

===A Means to an End===
[[File:Searching High and Low - end.jpg|thumb|Pocopoc and the Vessel atop the Resonant Peaks]]
Pelagos comes to Haven to report that something is happening with the oracle—[[Saezurah]]—in Exile's Hollow. Saezurah speaks through Pocopoc and guides the Maw Walker on a lengthy trip to the top of the [[Resonant Peaks]] to retrieve the empty [[Vessel]] of an [[Eternal One]]. Back in Exile's Hollow, Saezurah awakens and reveals that—once her preparations are complete—the Vessel will be used to create a new Arbiter to replace the one that the Jailer destroyed.
{{A Means to an End}}

===Starting Over===
[[File:For Every Soul.jpg|thumb|A new Arbiter is born]]
The Maw Walker is summoned to Exile's Hollow: it's time to make a new Arbiter, using a soul in the [[Crypts of the Eternal]]. The Crypts are guarded by Mawsworn, so the Maw Walker and Pelagos put together an army of covenant forces to get inside. The ritual begins, but a nathrezim ruins everything by summoning the [[Echo of Argus]]. All seems lost until Pelagos decides to offer his own soul as a replacement, and Saezurah transforms him into the new Arbiter. He takes his place in Oribos to allow souls to once again be sent to their rightful afterlives, and only one task is left before balance is restored to the Shadowlands: defeating the Jailer in the Sepulcher.

===Epilogue: Judgment===
[[File:A Long Walk - Crucible.jpg|thumb|The fate of Sylvanas Windrunner]]
The final chapter is optional in that it is not required to earn [[Secrets of the First Ones]]. It takes place after the events of the last three boss encounters of the Sepulcher, but as with the "Crown of Wills" chapter, no raid progress is required.

Following the defeat of the Jailer and the saving of the Shadowlands, Sylvanas is escorted to Oribos to be judged by the Arbiter for her past crimes. She hands herself over to her archenemy [[Tyrande Whisperwind]], who declares that she'll begin her penance by freeing all of the souls trapped in the [[Maw]] and sending them to Pelagos for judgment. Sylvanas accepts this and disappears into the Maw to get to work, closing off this last part of the Shadowlands storyline.
