==Objectives==
12 [[Prying Eye]]'s research data collected.
*Firim's Portal used
*Research data collected (12)
*Travel to new location via Portal Initiator
*[[Portal Initiator]] (provided)

==Description==
To aid in my studies, I have used a network of travel portals to install monitoring devices all over [[Zereth Mortis]].

My devices have been quite successful at collecting large amounts of research data. It's time now to collect the data they have obtained.

Use my portal network to locate my Prying Eyes and collect any data they have gathered. I'll give you a portal initiator as well, allowing you to re-enter the portal network, incase you find yourself lost!

==Rewards==
* 8,150 [[XP]]

You will receive a combination of three:
* {{cost|6|17|50}}
*Cypher Equipment
*[[Sandworn Relic]]

==Progress==
Have you collected all the data?

==Completion==
This will do fine, but there is still so much more to understand. With my Prying Eyes still out there, we shall be able to collect some more data very soon.
