==Objectives==
[[File:Hidden broker - Broker Decloaker.png|thumb|Hidden, but not quite invisible.]]
Kill 12 [[Cartel Xy]] agents just outside of [[Haven]].
*Xy agents slain (12)
*[[Decloakifier]] (provided)

==Description==
Do you sense a shift in the air? They may be hidden, but Cartel Xy is near.

Fortunately, the devices they use to cloak themselves are familiar to me. Here; take this. Place it on the ground and it will reveal nearby agents... for a time.

Stop them, even if you must take their lives.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found them?

==Completion==
Their deaths are a shame, but we must protect Haven.
