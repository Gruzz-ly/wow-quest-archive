==Objectives==
Place the Progenitor Magic Sensors in the [[Catalyst Gardens]].
*Sensors placed (8)

==Description==
The situation in the Catalyst Gardens is troubling.

But most troubling of all is that we do not know more. If we had an understanding of the changing levels of energy emitted by the [[Creation Catalyst]], we could make better decisions as to how to proceed.

Take these sensors. Place them below the catalyst at the locations marked upon your map.

==Rewards==
* Wrist Gear
* 18 [[Cyphers of the First Ones]]
* 75 [[Cosmic Flux]]

==Progress==
Were you able to place the sensors?

==Completion==
Our brightest scholars will track the sensor data. First Ones willing, they will show us the way.

==Patch changes==
