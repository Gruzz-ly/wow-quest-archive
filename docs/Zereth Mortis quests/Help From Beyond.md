==Description==
If we stand any chance of breaking through the [[Mawsworn]] forces, we will need the help of all of the [[covenant]]s.

I will speak with the [[Kyrian Covenant|Kyrian]]. You and [[Pelagos]] can speak with the others. But before you go, ask Firim if there is any way we can gain the support of the Enlightened as well.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Completion==
Between the strength of the covenant forces and the help of the [[automa]], we should be able to reach the Crypts!

==Notes==
On accept, Pelagos starts following the player.
:{{Text|say|Kleia|I will rally the Kyrian. You and Pelagos speak to the other covenants. And see if Firim can enlist the Enlightened.}}
:''She flies out of the cave.''

Talk to Firim:
:We are to have a hand in the very threads of creation... astonishing!
:{{Gossip|Can we get additional aid from the Enlightened?}}
:{{Text|say|Firim|I doubt my compatriots in Haven would dare tread on such hallowed ground. But, fear not! I, as always, have an idea.}}
:''He walks over to [[Kbato]], a dormant automa in the back of the cave.''
:{{Text|say|Firim|Kbato! We have need of your assistance! Kbato?}}
:{{Text|say|Firim|Hmm. Perhaps you can awaken it, mortal.}}

Interact with Kbato to wake it up and cause it to lumber out of the cave.
:{{Text|say|Firim|Ah, there you are! Meet us near the [[Crypts of the Eternal|Eternal Crypts]], Kbato. It is time to fight back against the Mawsworn!}}

Upon exiting the hollow:
:{{Text|say|Pelagos|A new Arbiter... a chance to restore balance to the Shadowlands...}}
:{{Text|say|Pelagos|Could there be any greater act of service?}}

Next it's time to recruit the venthyr in the [[Catalyst Gardens]]. While heading through the [[Genesis Fields]] with Pelagos:
:{{Text|say|Pelagos|With a new [[Arbiter (title)|Arbiter]] in place, I hope every [[soul]] finds the afterlife they truly deserve.}}

[[File:Help From Beyond - Venthyr.jpg|thumb|Nadjia and the Venthyr]]
At the entrance to the Gardens, talk to [[Nadjia the Mistblade|Nadjia]].{{Co|47.71|80.68|Zereth Mortis}}
:Whatever the task, Maw Walker, you know you have my blade.
:{{Gossip|I need your assistance.}}
:{{Text|say|Nadjia the Mistblade|[[Revendreth]] stands beside you, Maw Walker. To battle!}}
:''Nadjia, [[Tactician Sakaa]], the [[Sinfall Guarantor]]s, and [[Stoneborn Legionnaire]]s move out and head north.''
:{{Text|say|Nadjia the Mistblade|Let us hope your plan works. Revendreth needs [[anima]]--and for that, we need souls that deserve redemption.}}

Next up, the night fae at the [[Forge of Afterlives]]. En route:
:{{Text|say|Pelagos|Nadjia has a point. But if you ask me... well, I think every soul deserves redemption.}}

[[File:Help From Beyond - Night Fae.jpg|thumb|Aliothe and the Night Fae]]
Talk to [[Droman Aliothe]] just south of the Forge.{{Co|47.8|58.34|Zereth Mortis}}
:We are far from [[Ardenweald]]--but I will defend this land as I have long defended the forests and the wild.
:{{Gossip|Will you bring your forces to fight with us?}}
:{{Text|say|Droman Aliothe|The might of Ardenweald is yours, Maw Walker.}}
:''Aliothe, [[Hunt-Captain Korayn]], the [[Vorkai Guardian]]s, and [[Sylvari Protector]]s move out.
:{{Text|say|Droman Aliothe|We have always watched over the great cycle. I hope that this new Arbiter will do the same.}}

Finally, head northeast to the necrolord forces at [[Provis Esper]].
:{{Text|say|Pelagos|To watch over the great cycle... the Arbiter's decisions affect more than just souls, but the Shadowlands entire.}}

[[File:Help From Beyond - Necrolords.jpg|thumb|Mevix and the Necrolords]]
Talk to [[Secutor Mevix]].{{Co|53.93|48.39|Zereth Mortis}}
:Maw Walker! Have you come with news of victory?
:{{Gossip|Will you bring your forces to fight with us?}}
:{{Text|say|Secutor Mevix|Soldiers! You heard the Maw Walker--we march on the [[Endless Sands]]!}}
:''Mevix, [[Emeni]], the [[Prime Gatecrasher]], the [[Boneplated Sharpshooter]]s, and the [[Peerless Eye]]s move out to the east.''
:{{Text|say|Secutor Mevix|Let's see if this new Arbiter proves strong enough for the task ahead.}}

Follow their path northeast to the [[Deserted Overlook]]. Along the way:
:{{Text|say|Pelagos|Mevix is right. The Arbiter must have the strength and resolve to do what must be done.}}

[[File:Help From Beyond - Leaders.jpg|thumb|The whole gang is here]]
At the Deserted Overlook, the whole gang is gathered. On the overlook platform itself: [[Saezurah]], two [[Saezurah's Protector]]s, Emeni, a Boneplated Sharpshooter, Hunt-Captain Korayn, Kleia, Nadjia the Mistblade, Secutor Mevix, and Tactician Sakaa. In addition, [[Firim]] is instructing a [[Motivated Servitor]] on how to tend to [[Kbato]]:
*{{Text|say|Firim|Do not remove the foliage, it enhances his abilities!}}
*{{Text|say|Firim|Search the area, there is much here we can make use of!}}

He has new gossip text as well:
:The Mawsworn will prove no match for the Automa we have assembled!

Kleia has new gossip text too:
:The winds of change have arrived.

[[File:Help From Beyond - Troops.jpg|thumb|Assembled covenant troops]]
Meanwhile, [[Kyrian Avenger]]s patrol the skies above and Droman Aliothe overlooks the Endless Sands from a lower outcropping. Beside the road, a large band of generic covenant troops is stationed: Sinfall Guarantors, Stoneborn Legionnaires, Sylvari Protectors, Peerless Eyes, [[Prime Bladeguard]]s, Vorkai Guardians, a single [[Grove Guardian]] and a lone Prime Gatecrasher.

Upon arrival, Pelagos leaves the player's side to stand with Kleia. After turning in the quest, he gets new gossip text:
:When we stand together, none may stand against us.
