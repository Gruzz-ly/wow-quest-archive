==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Proto Architect.jpg|Proto Architect|The principal engineer of the Arrangement Index handcrafted many prototype designs.}}
Find the [[Proto Architect]] in the [[Chamber of Shaping]] and retrieve a Restoration Matrix.
*[[Restoration Matrix]]
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
The architect alone possesses the required for the restoration. The architect will restore the [[Protoform Repository]].

The mortal will gain access to the Chamber of Shaping and inform the architect of recent progress. The architect will restore the repository.

Fulfillment of the task is imminent.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The architect will assist us.

==Completion==
The Restoration Matrix is acquired. The architect is not present. The architect is therefore lost.

Restoration of the repository is mandatory, even so.
