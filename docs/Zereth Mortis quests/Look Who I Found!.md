==Objectives==
Retrieve 6 Chromatic Rosids near [[Dimensional Falls]].
*[[Chromatic Rosid]] collected (6)
*Deliver the Chromatic Rosids to [[Tamra]]
*Observe Tamra's experiment

==Description==
Behold this magnificent creature!

[[Siloh]] says we have no resources for another of my "abnormal pets."

But we may be able to alter [[E'rnee]] so that I can keep him. Strange interactions occur between creatures and this environment. Perhaps we can make him smaller.

I know a spot where we can conduct our research. There are flowers nearby called that might trigger a reaction. Why don't you collect some on the way?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must find a way to keep E'rnee.

==Completion==
Perhaps we should do some experiments with other subjects before trying things out on E'rnee.
