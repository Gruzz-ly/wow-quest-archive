==Objectives==
Giagantic and 12 Geomentals examined for research data.
*[[Gaiagantic]] examined
*[[Geomental]] examined (12)
*Geomental stunned with Displacement Trap
*[[Containment Trap]] (provided)

==Description==
Since our arrival here the [[Untamed Verdure]] has been a mystery waiting to be solved. The lush foliage of the area grows on everything as the creatures run amok without purpose.

There could be valuable research data to be obtained from these creatures.

Use a Containment Trap to subdue the elemental creatures. Once subdued, examine them for research data.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 8 [[Anima Webbing]]
* 19 [[Cyphers of the First Ones]]
* 75 [[Cosmic Flux]]
* {{cost|6|17|50}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you completed the research?

==Completion==
This information will help, but I'm afraid those ruins still remain a mystery!

==Patch changes==
