[[File:Automa Scryer.jpg|thumb|The freed Scryers]]
[[Dominator's Key]] drops from any of the Mawsworn and Dominated automa in the Endless Sands, including the oracles needed for [[Cleaving A Path]]. Use them to unlock the [[Mawsworn Cell]]s holding [[Automa Scryer]]s. On release, they say:
*{{Text|say|Automa Scryer|Assistance is welcomed.}}
*{{Text|say|Automa Scryer|I will continue.}}
*{{Text|say|Automa Scryer|Saezurah summons.}}

After completing the objective, the six Scryers join Saezurah atop the Overlook. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Saezurah|Voices freed, a symphony in stasis. Their moment will soon arrive.}}

On completion, [[Pelagos]] runs down the hill to [[Firim]].
:{{Text|say|Pelagos|Well done! I will check on the others.}}
