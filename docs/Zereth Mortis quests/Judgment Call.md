==Objectives==
Speak to [[Elder Amir]] in [[Pilgrim's Grace]].

==Description ==
Oh no... No no no... What have I done?

The elders will never take me back. They shall cast me out as they did [[Firim]].

Please, outsider, speak to Elder Amir in Pilgrim's Grace. Give him my thanks for sending you, and tell him all that has happened here. He will understand why I must never return.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|57|40}}
*1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Tahli is alive? And you preserved an automa archive with her help?! Oh, my. That is... a lot to take in.

And, of course her guilt has prevented her from returning home. Oh, Tahli.

==Notes==
; Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Tahli|I am sorry, Kodah. I hope that wherever you are, you can still dream.}}

:{{Text|say|Elder Amir|Have you forgotten the lesson that our home teaches us? One cannot "deserve" grace. One can only receive it.}}
