This quest can be started after [[Daelic Understanding]] has been researched at the [[Cypher Console]].

==Objectives==
[[File:Pocopoc on vombata.png|thumb|Mounted up!]]
Examine the curious creature outside of [[Exile's Hollow]].
*[[Coreless Vombata|Curious creature]] examined

==Description==
Your timing is most excellent.

It appears one of my traps captured a rather curious creature moments ago. I dare not investigate, but you... you can do this for me.

Take Pocopoc along with you. Perhaps there are secrets yet to be discovered.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|12|87}}
* 4,100 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Find something of interest?

==Completion==
Pocopoc is most intriguing, yes? I do wonder the extent of its capabilities.

==Notes==
;Upon examining the Coreless Vombata
:<The coreless automa lays motionless before you.>
:{{Gossip|Encourage Pocopoc to expend 1 energy to take control of this coreless creature.>}}
:''Pocopoc jumps and activates the Coreless Vombata, riding atop it. This process turns it into a [[Resonant Vombata]].''
