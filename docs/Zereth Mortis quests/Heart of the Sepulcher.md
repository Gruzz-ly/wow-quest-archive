==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Eternity's End - Zovaal.jpg|Zovaal|The Jailer cannot be allowed to enact his plan. The fate of all creation is in your hands. Stop him.}}
Defeat [[the Jailer]] in the [[Sepulcher of the First Ones]].
* [[The Jailer (tactics)|Zovaal]] defeated

==Description==
Soon after we stepped forth into the realms of [[Death]], a message left behind by the [[Primus]] gave warning that the Jailer must not be allowed to reach the Sepulcher.

Despite all our efforts, he has done so.

Within the heart of that ancient place lie secrets that the Jailer could use to dominate [[Great Dark Beyond|the entire cosmos]]. If he succeeds, everything we hold dear will be lost.

Gather your allies, <name>. Claim victory for the [[Shadowlands]]... and for [[Azeroth]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|77|22}}
* 12,250 [[XP]]
* +1,000 [[reputation]] with [[The Enlightened]]
* [[Anima Matrix]] x8

==Progress==
The time to strike is now. Return to me once the deed is done.

==Completion==
At long last, our campaign is at an end. Thanks to you, the Jailer has been defeated.

Your efforts have saved us all, <name>.

==PTR version==
