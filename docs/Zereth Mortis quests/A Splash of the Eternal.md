==Objectives==
Help Glimmercane extract water from the pool in the [[Untamed Verdure]].
*Speak to [[Glimmercane]]
*Glimmercane defended
*[[Eternal Water (quest item)]]
*Place the Eternal Water in the inert automa.

==Description==
I don't really know much about this place or its inhabitants, but what I do know is [[magic]]! I can sense ancient power from the waters near us.

Maybe that can help?

Let's check out that pond!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The automa lies inert.>

==Completion==
<A small opening in the creature looks like the perfect size for a little pour of mystical water.>

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|The pond right by us should work. See you there!}}

;Talking to Glimmercane near the pon
:I don't know if this will work, but I have a tingling in the tips of my ears that gives me hope.
:Gosh, are you ready?
:{{Gossip|Let's do this.}}

:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|We might have some unwanted attention as I draw out the eternal water... but don't worry! We've got this!}}
:''[[Forgotten Geomental]]s attack.''
:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|The water feels strange! This might be harder than I thought...}}
:''More geomentals attack, after which a [[Startled Aurelid]] appears.''
:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|Oops! Sorry, little guy!}}
:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|Almost... got it! Just a bit longer, friend!}}
:''More geomentals attack.''
:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|We did it! Wow! Now, let's hope this water will do the trick.}}
;Picking up the Eternal Water
:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|I bet that will get that automa up and running!}}

;Talking to Glimmercane afterwards
:That was so fun! Can we do it again sometime?

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Charged Constructor|Awaiting instruction.}}
