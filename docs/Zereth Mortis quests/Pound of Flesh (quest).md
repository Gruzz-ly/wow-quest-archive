==Objectives==
Collect 30 Warped Flesh from [[devourer]]s at [[Zovaal's Grasp]].
*[[Warped Flesh (quest item)]] (30)

==Description==
[[Automa]] remove threats to us. But there are no more automa. We must help ourselves. We need [[magic]].

Devourers ate the orb magic. Now they are warped and twisted. But also full of magic.

Bring us devourer flesh. We will extract the magic. We will need it to defeat the devourers.

* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Devourers were not meant to eat this magic.

==Completion==

<The jiro sorts through the gooping mass of meat.>

It will have to do.
