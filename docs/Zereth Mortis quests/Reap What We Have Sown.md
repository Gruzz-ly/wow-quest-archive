==Objectives==
Defeat the Charged Constructor.
*[[Charged Constructor]] slain
*Koh followed

==Description==
We told the constructor that we will use the [[Blooming Foundry|Foundry]] to reset this land.

We must stop it and protect the new [[automa]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Scouring Oracular Smock
|Nova Oracular Smock
|Crystallic Oracular Smock
|Scouring Cryptic Mask
|Nova Cryptic Mask
|Crystallic Cryptic Mask
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|25|74}}
*8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We must stop the constructor before it is too late.

==Completion==
Learning about new creatures that are infused with living growth--well, that sounds right up my alley!

I think I'll stay with them and see how I can help... and maybe pick up their language as well.

Thanks for coming on this adventure with me, friend!
