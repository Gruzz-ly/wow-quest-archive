==Objectives==
Recover Strange Artifacts from [[Provis Strata]].
*[[Strange Artifact]] (10)

==Description==
Much has been lost to the invading forces, those that came with destruction in their hearts.

We cannot preserve this land as the [[First Ones]] intended if the [[Mawsworn]] are allowed to pulverize all remnants of their knowledge.

See what you can recover from the sands of Provis Strata.

==Rewards==
* 8,150 [[XP]]

You will receive a combination of three from:
* Cypher Gear
*X [[Anima Webbing]]
* 19 - 32 [[Cyphers of the First Ones]]
* 75 [[Cosmic Flux]]
*[[Sandworn Relic]]
* {{cost|6|17|50}}

==Progress==
What was before, will be again.

==Completion==
Without the context in which these were first made, they may remain mysteries. But at least they are not trampled underfoot anymore.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.2.0|note=Added.}}
