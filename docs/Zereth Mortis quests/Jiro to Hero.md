Following this quest, [[Circle Olea]] relocates to [[Faith's Repose]].

==Objectives==
Defend the jiro from devourers until they enact the dampening field.
*Meet up with the [[jiro]]
*Speak to [[Hanoa the Exile]]
*Defend the jiro from the [[devourer]]s

==Description==
I have spoken to other jiro. Our orb can create a dampening field. It should close the rifts and stop new ones from forming.

It must be done where the [[Maw]] [[magic]] is strongest. Between the giant chains. The power released by the orb will draw devourers. You and I must defend the orb until the field is set.

I will escort the others. Meet us at the rift when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Devourers have been repelled. For now. But they will return.

One day, we will remove them forever. I will stay to defend the jiro until then.

This could not have been done without you. You have my deepest gratitude.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|Is the orb ready?}}
:{{text|say|Olea Pau|Yes.}}
:{{text|say|Olea Manu|Yes.}}
:{{text|say|Olea Novi|Yes.}}
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|Good. I will escort the jiro, <name>. Meet us at the largest rift.}}

Upon arriving at the quest location, the three Olea Jiros have some gossip:

Olea Pau:
:We have empowered the orb with the magic acquired.

Olea Novi:
:We have repaired the orb with the fragments collected.

Olea Manu:
:We have attuned the orb with the information gathered.

Approaching Hanoa
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|There is not much time. Let me know when you are ready.}}

:We must not stay long or we will be overwhelmed.

:{{gossip|The jiro may begin establishing the dampening field.}}

:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|Protect the jiro! Devourers will be drawn by the energy of the orb.}}

Upon defeating the first wave:
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|More devourers come through the portal. The jiro must be protected!}}

After the second wave, [[The Cosmic Hungerer]] appears:
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|A large devourer approaches...}}

Upon defeating the final wave:
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|The dampening field is in place! Let us retreat to a safer location.}}

After turning in the quest, the Jiro have new gossip, only for a brief moment however, as they all despawn following a conversation between themselves:
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|You have my thanks, <name>. This could not have been done without you.}}
:{{text|say|Olea Pau|It was not just <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Olea Novi|We could not have done this without Hanoa.}}
:{{text|say|Olea Manu|Hanoa protected us.}}
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|Any jiro would have done the same.}}
:{{text|say|Olea Pau|We agree. Hanoa is jiro.}}
:{{text|say|Olea Novi|All jiro belong to a Circle.}}
:{{text|say|Olea Manu|We welcome Hanoa back to our Circle.}}
:{{text|say|Hanoa the Exile|But I am severed... is that wise?}}
:{{text|say|Olea Pau|Hanoa is not a danger.}}
:{{text|say|Olea Novi|Hanoa is our family.}}
:{{text|say|Olea Manu|Welcome home, Olea Hanoa.}}

Olea Pau:
:While <name> is away, Hanoa will protect us. We have learned much. We will not be eaten.

Olea Novi:
:Hanoa is different. Severed. Yet Hanoa is the same.
:Jiro have never faced this paradox. We will face it together.

Olea Manu:
:Maw magic severed Hanoa. Broke the link to our Circle.
:Is Hanoa the only severed? Are there others?
