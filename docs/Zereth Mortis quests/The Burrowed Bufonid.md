==Objectives==
Collect 15 Vespoid Honey from [[Vespoid]] around [[Zereth Mortis]].
*[[Vespoid Honey]] (15)

==Description==
Have you stopped to watch the [[bufonid]]s?

A lovely one lurks underwater. Still, patient, unmoving. Wise Bud takes after him. They are much alike. I sense Bud desires to see this large bufonid up close.

Perhaps the creature can be lured out with some honey from the vespoids here in Zereth Mortis. Would you please gather some?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found that honey?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Now, let us see if this will entice that bufonid to emerge.

==Notes==
