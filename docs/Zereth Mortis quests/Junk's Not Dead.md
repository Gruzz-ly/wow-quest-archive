==Objectives==
Obtain glyphs from 6 [[Depleted Servitor]]s around the [[Arrangement Index]].
*Cyphers transcribed (6)
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
This [[automa]] has been hiding here! I suspect it will not be receptive to our help.

I am hesitant to suggest this, but if the [[Hidden Servitor|servitor]] were to associate you with this facility, it might be more amenable.

If you have the means, copy the glyphs inscribed on similar automa outside. Those that the [[Maw]] have touched will be tainted, but I saw from my vantage point a few fallen automa in the sands with untarnished glyphs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to transcribe the glyphs from among the fallen?

==Completion==
I hope this will encourage our friend here to view us as an ally. [[First Ones]] forgive us.

==Notes==
;Upon accepting both [[Junk's Not Dead]] and [[Core Competency]]
:{{Text|say|Tahli|May the First Ones forgive us for our actions.}}

==Progression==
{{The Final Song}}

==PTR 9.2 Description==
This automa has been hiding itself here! It is weak, but I suspect it will not be receptive to our help.

I am hesitant to suggest this, but if the servitor were to believe you were associated with this facility, it might be more amenable. 

If you have the means, copy the cyphers inscribed on similar automa outside. Those that the Maw have touched will be tainted, but I saw from my vantage point a few fallen automa in the sands that have untarnished cyphers.
