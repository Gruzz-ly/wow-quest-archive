==Objectives==
Charge a Depleted Automa Core by draining slain wild creatures in the [[Arrangement Index]].
*Automa core charged
*Suggested players: 3
*[[Depleted Automa Core]] (provided)

==Description==
The poor thing.

The sacred should not be disturbed, but... will the elders judge us if we help it survive? This is preservation, not interference.

...I hope.

We can power it back up. Use this depleted core as a conduit. Perhaps the larger wild animates in the nearby sands have enough energy to charge it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you acquire enough energy for this lonely automa?

==Completion==
This lonely one will be strong again.
