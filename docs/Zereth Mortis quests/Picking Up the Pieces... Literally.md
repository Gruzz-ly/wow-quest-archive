==Objectives==
Collect 30 Orb Fragments.
*[[Orb Fragment]] (30)

==Description==
Orbs help us develop terrain for the Forge. [[Magic]] within the orbs draws the [[devourer]]s. They tear apart the metal to reach it. We must collect the remains.

Look for the fragments around the orbs. Bring them to us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find the fragments? We need many pieces.

==Completion==
Enough to fix a small orb. This will do.
