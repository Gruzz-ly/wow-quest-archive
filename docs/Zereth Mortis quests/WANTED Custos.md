Eliminate Custos
*[[Custos]] slain
*Inform Rafiq in Pilgrim's Grace of your success.
*Suggested players: 3

==Description==
A once-stable [[automa]] is showing signs of unusual dysfunction, attacking [[Enlightened]] along the road outside of [[Pilgrim's Grace]].

It is essential that the roads remain safe for our pilgrims.

[[Rafiq]] has designated the elimination of this threat to be of the highest priority.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48|}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[The Enlightened]]

{{itembox||q1=2|Anima Matrix
}}

==Progress==
Did you eliminate the threat?

==Completion==
I do not understand why it was behaving in that manner, but we will be safer now that it is gone. This reward shall start you on the way towards some of my finer equipment.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 9.2.0|note=Added.}}
