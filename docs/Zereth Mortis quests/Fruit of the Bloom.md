==Objectives==
Gather Catamelon Seeds and slay Overgrowth in the [[Catalyst Gardens]].
*Overgrowth slain (12)
*[[Catamelon Seed]] (8)

==Description==
We never know when something new may emerge from the confluence of creation and energy.

The Catalyst Gardens have blossomed with a new crop of fruit. Their seeds may have special properties, and we wish to understand them.

Please gather what you can find, and make the gardens safer for the future.

==Rewards==

==Progress==
How can one understand what cannot be defined?

==Completion==
There is so much to learn from just these little seeds. What will they grow into? Will the vombata eat them?

Thank you for helping me to understand this place further.

==Notes==
Kill [[Gluttonous Overgrowth]]s, [[Sentient Overgrowth]]s, [[Agitated Overgrowth]], and [[Carnivorous Overgrowth]].
