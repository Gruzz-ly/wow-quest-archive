==Objectives==
Find [[Elder Eru]] outside the [[Lexical Glade]].

==Description==
Since we have earned the trust of the [[Enlightened]], I have learned more about their explorations into [[Zereth Mortis]].

They know more than they are willing to tell, but often do not act on that knowledge. Perhaps where they observe, we can be a catalyst for action.

In a secluded corner called the Lexical Glade, there is an elder named Eru. She may be able to give us insight on how we might use the [[language of the First Ones]].

Seek her out, and see if she will help us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|57|40}}
* 1,000 [[XP]]

==Completion==
What is this? You wish to know if there is anything here that can help you resist [[Mawsworn]] magic?

You are in luck, stranger. I happen to know that this place is a library. And libraries are wonderful places to find what you are looking for.
