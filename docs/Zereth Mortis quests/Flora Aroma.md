==Objectives==
Experiment with Chromatic Rosids near [[Dimensional Falls]].
*Use a Chromatic Rosid on a [[Dimensional Cervid]]
*Use a Chromatic Rosid on a [[Dimensional Vombata]]
*Use a Chromatic Rosid on an [[Dimensional Bufonid]]
*[[Chromatic Rosid#Usable]] (provided)

==Description==
Perhaps we should not experiment on E'rnee without first knowing the effects.

Hang on to the rest of these rosids. We can run more tests. Some of the creatures here near the waterfall are more tame than others, and will be suitable for such experimentation.

Let us discover whether different creatures have diverse responses to the rosid aroma.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Those rosids have such an odd aroma... Perhaps creatures will respond to it in unique ways.

==Completion==
These results seem... inconclusive.
