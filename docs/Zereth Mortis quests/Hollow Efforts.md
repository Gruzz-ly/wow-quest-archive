==Objectives==
Collect 40 Remnant Neomotes from [[Progenitor Forge]]s using Firim's Forge Tap.
*[[Remnant Neomotes]] (40)
*[[Firim's Forge-Tap]] (provided)

==Description==
The large metal spheres that litter the landscape of [[Zereth Mortis]] are spent forges, discarded during the creation process. 

These empty metal husks still contain residual materials of creation that may be useful to us.

Use my Forge-Tap near these metal spheres to harvest any Remnant Neomotes. You may also find other useful proto-materials!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9 [[Anima Webbing]]
* 30 [[Cyphers of the First Ones]]
* 75 [[Cosmic Flux]]
* {{cost|6|17|50}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you gathered the materials already?

==Completion==
Excellent work, <name>. These resources will bolster our efforts here.

==Notes==
Use [[Firim's Forge-Tap]] on orbs found in the areas stretching from [[Exile's Hollow]] to the [[Genesis Fields]] to the south-east.
