==Objectives==
Kill 50 E'rnee Duplicates.
*[[E'rnee Duplicate]] slain (50)

==Description==
Those little E'rnee duplicates were unfriendly.

Some effect of the [[Dimensional Falls|Falls]] created them. They are not stable. Did you see where they went?

They must be culled before they harm the rest of the wildlife. You take care of that while I collect another sample from the Falls.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you found the duplicates?

==Completion==
Oh my... what happened to you?

==Progression==
{{Small Pet Problems}}

==PTR version==
;Description
:Those little E'rnee duplicates didn't look too friendly.

:I don't know what effect from the Falls created them, but I don't think they're stable. We need to cull them before they harm the rest of the wildlife.

:Did you happen to see where they went? Uh... why don't you take care of that while I collect another sample from the Falls?
