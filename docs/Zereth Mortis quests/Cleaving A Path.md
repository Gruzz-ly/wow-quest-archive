==Objectives==
[[File:Oracle Voraxxi.jpg|thumb|Oracle Voraxxi]]
[[File:Oracle Zoketh.jpg|thumb|Oracle Zoketh]]
Slay Oracle Zoketh and Oracle Voraxxi.
*[[Oracle Voraxxi]] slain{{Co|59.3|32.73|Zereth Mortis}}
*[[Oracle Zoketh]] slain

==Description==
[[Maw Walker]]! My [[scout]]s report that the [[Mawsworn]] have [[Domination|dominated]] two [[automa]] Oracles to aid them in battle. These Oracles will most certainly predict our strategy and our ultimate goal, if given the chance.

We need to eliminate both Oracles before we enter the [[Crypts of the Eternal|Crypts]]. With them out of the way, the Mawsworn troops won't know what we're doing until we're finished with it.

Take [[Emeni]] with you. She's eager for battle.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|51|48}}
* 10,200 [[XP]]
*[[Emblem of Renown]]

==Progress==
Has it been done?

==Completion==
Perfectly executed, <name>. The loss of those Oracles should keep the Mawsworn in the dark.

==Notes==
On accept, Emeni starts following the player while Mevix, [[Nadjia the Mistblade|Nadjia]], [[Tactician Sakaa|Sakaa]], [[Hunt-Captain Korayn|Korayn]], and the [[Boneplated Sharpshooter]] run down the road.
:{{Text|say|Secutor Mevix|You and Emeni eliminate those oracles. We will prepare for the assault.}}

Both Zoketh and Voraxxi can drop [[Dominator's Key]], required for [[Keys To Victory]].

Upon completing all three quests' objectives, Mevix, Nadjia, Korayn, and Sakaa spawn at the front of the band of covenant troops. The secutor gets new temporary gossip text as well:
:Our strategy is sound, we will be victorious!
