==Objectives==
Find 8 Automa Internals from [[Abandoned Automa]] in the [[Untamed Verdure]].
*[[Automa Internals]] (8)

==Description==
The [[Blooming Foundry]] created this area. It maintains the [[automa]], the creatures, and the plants.

The overgrowth is its fault.

We need to enter the Foundry to fix this land. This constructor can break through when it is working.

Many automa in this area stopped moving long ago. Find usable pieces inside them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
With your help, we will restore this place to its glory.

==Completion==
This will work.

==Notes==
;As you move around the area
:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|All of these beasts are covered with plants, too. How are they moving?}}
:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|I sense something ancient and powerful by those strange creatures!}}
;Upon approaching an Abandoned Automa
:{{Text|say|Glimmercane|How long do you think this creature wandered before it stopped moving here?}}

;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Koh Riva|It is not enough. The constructor needs more.}}
