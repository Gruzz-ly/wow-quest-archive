==Objectives==
Throw Water on E'rnee.
*Throw Water on [[E'rnee]]

==Description==
Oh, no. I have created havoc in this sacred place.

Look. E'rnee has bonded with you. It pains me, but you would be a better caretaker for him than I have been.

Once we resolve this, you should take him.

Now we know, at least, that the [[Dimensional Falls|Falls]] have the ability to change the size of creatures. Let us try it again.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

{{itembox||E'rnee (companion)
}}

==Progress==
If this does not work, we can always try again!

==Completion==
It worked! I cannot thank you enough for your help. And now, he is yours. Take good care of him.

Goodbye, E'rnee.

==Notes==
The Throw Water extra action button becomes available.

Completing the quest awards the Small Pet Problems criterion of [[Path to Enlightenment]].

==Progression==
{{Small Pet Problems}}
