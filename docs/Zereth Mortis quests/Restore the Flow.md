Find a way to restore Locrian Esper.
*[[Locrian Swale]]
*[[Locrian Esper]] entered
*Locrian Swale aligned
*[[Locrian Valve|Valves]] tuned (2)
*[[Percolation Array]] aligned
*[[Xelleth the Souldrinker]] slain

==Description==
Look! [[Devourer]]s have penetrated the temple's defenses. Those ravenous menaces feed on any energy that they can find. They must have been drawn to the wellspring's power.

With that kind of interference, no wonder the waters have been stalled!

The solution must be inside Locrian Esper. Once there, see if you can find a way to reverse the damage that has been done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<The console thrums with power.>

==Completion==
<It seems as though your efforts were successful--the waters are once again flowing through the temple. The wellspring should be restored.>

==Notes==
;Nadir gossip
:This desecration cannot continue! Please, <name>, return Provis Esper to its rightful state.

;Upon accept
:{{Text|Say|[[Nadir]]|I have seen a relic like that before... akin to some kind of divining rod. Take it with you. It must be important.}}

;Upon accepting both [[Restore the Flow]] and [[An Automa-free Diet]]
:{{Text|Say|[[Nadir]]|I... I do not think I need to see the temple with my own eyes. Go. Heal the wellspring. I must return to Olem, and think on what I have learned.}}

;Upon interacting with the Percolation Array
:{{Text|bossemote|An unsettling shriek erupts from the room to the east.}}

;Description
:These [[devourer]]s have penetrated the temple's defenses. They must be after the source of the [[Wellspring of the First Ones|Wellspring]]!

:I am no <class> like you, but something needs to done. Will you help us?

:You'll need to get inside Locrian Esper. Once you are inside, find out what's happened and try to reverse the damage if you can.
