Slay Punisher Makaris and collect 6 Sacred Relics.
*[[Punisher Makaris]] slain
*[[Sacred Relic]] (6)

==Description==
We have obtained a wealth of information from relics discovered at the [[Ageless Shards]].

The [[Mawsworn]] are aware of our discoveries, and are trying to stop us. They have placed traps around the area to block access to the relics.

We cannot allow [[the Jailer]] to cut off our access to those relics.

Please eliminate this Mawsworn threat, and recover as many relics as possible.

You will receive:
* 8,150 [[XP]]
* {{cost|6|17|50}}

And a combination of three from:
* 8 [[Anima Webbing]]
* 22 [[Cyphers of the First Ones]]
* 75 [[Cosmic Flux]]
* {{cost|276|32}}
*Piece of Cypher Equipment

==Progress==
Have you secured the relics at the Ageless Shards?

==Completion==
Blessed be your effort!
