==Objectives==
[[File:Shield Conduit.png|thumb|Shield Conduit.]]
Investigate the [[Shield Conduit]]s around [[Haven]].
*Northwest Conduit checked
*Northeast Conduit checked
*Southwest Conduit checked
*Southeast Conduit checked

==Description==
[[File:Shield Reinforcement Kit.png|thumb|Shield Reinforcement Kit.]]
I do not understand--these are my brethren! How can they be so careless, so unconcerned with both [[Cartel Xy]] and the [[Mawsworn]] at their doorstep?

Their protective [[technology]] is antiquated. It will not keep danger out. If I cannot persuade them to leave, I can at least ensure they are safe where they insist on staying.

I do not want to lose my friends again.

There should be four hidden conduits around the edge of the shield. Take this kit. It will allow you to inspect and repair them, if needed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
[[File:Shield Conduit - Reinforced.png|thumb|Shields up!]]
Should those conduits fall, we will need to construct additional ones. Nobody wants that.

==Completion==
I knew it. Cartel Xy has been meddling with Haven's defenses!

:{{Text|say|Al'dalil|Please come home, Rana. This place is treacherous.}}
:{{Text|say|Rana|There is treachery, certainly, but there is also awe, sanctity, and eventually... enlightenment.}}

;Upon checking the Northwest Conduit
:<You bolster the device and notice an immediate improvement to the shields in this area.>

;Upon checking the Northeast Conduit
:The conduit whirrs unevenly, clearly out of balance. You adjust the device until it quiets, successfully repaired.>

;Upon checking the Southwest Conduit
:<Although unstable, you are able to successfully bolster the device--and Haven's defenses.>

;Upon checking the Southeast Conduit
:The device has clearly been tempered with. Try as you might, it cannot be repaired.
;A [[Cartel Xy Saboteur]] appears and attacks:
:{{Text|say|Cartel Xy Saboteur|Stop right there!}}
:{{Text|say|Cartel Xy Saboteur|Cartel Xy... will not... be stopped...}}
