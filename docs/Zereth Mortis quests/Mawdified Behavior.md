==Objectives==
{{questportrait|The Unraveller.png|[[The Unraveller]]|A new type of devourer that has absorbed the magic of the First Ones.}}
Kill the Unraveller and search it for clues.
*[[The Unraveller]] slain
*[[Black Steel Fragment]]

==Description==
There is a [[devourer]] in the cave. It creates a rift. This should not be possible in Zereth Mortis.

Enter the cave and destroy the devourer. Search for clues. See how it can open a rift.

Be careful. This one is different from others. It has absorbed the [[magic]] of the [[First Ones]]. This has never happened before. Be ready for anything.

I will stay here and protect the [[jiro]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74|}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is the devourer destroyed? Did you find any clues?

==Completion==
A new type of devourer. Troubling. Hopefully these are the only ones.

As for this mysterious metal... I have seen it before.

;Talking to Olea Novi
:We featred Hanoa would infect us with the Maw. This is why we banished Hanoa.
