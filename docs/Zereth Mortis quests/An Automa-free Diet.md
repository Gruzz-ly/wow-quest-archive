==Objectives==
Kill 10 [[Soul-Parched Gorger|Invading Gorgers]] and [[Reality Breacher]]s.
*Breachers and Gorgers slain (10)

==Description==
These devourers are relentless! They feed on any energy they can find. If left unchecked, they would surely devour the whole of Zereth Mortis. We cannot allow the creations of the First Ones to be sullied by these invaders!

I am no fighter. But you... perhaps the First Ones delivered you to us after all. Will you help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|25|74}}
* 8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have the devourers been dealth with?

==Completion==
Stranger, I... I apologize. My trust in you was lacking. In turn, my faith wavered as well. Forgive me, and take with you my thanks--the First Ones truly guide your hand.

==Notes==
[[Monstrous Riftcrasher]] also counts.
