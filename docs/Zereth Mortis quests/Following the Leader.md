==Objectives==
[[File:Slumbering Vault Lock.png|thumb|Open the door with lock.]]
Investigate the Slumbering Vault.
*[[Slumbering Vault]] reached
*[[Slumbering Vault Lock|Vault door opened]]

==Description==
We sealed the door to the Slumbering Vault when we first arrived. It is a sanctum, a cradle of all that is precious here. The power that sleeps within should not be touched by us.

If the [[Cartel Xy|Xy]] leader made it past the shields while we were distracted by the beauty of this place, I shudder to think of what they have already disturbed.

Hurry! We must go to the Slumbering Vault and ensure its safety.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|12|87}}
*8,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Cartel Xy must be stopped!

==Completion==
No! What has that fool done to the console?!

==Notes==

:{{Text|say|[[Al'dalil]]|Please just come home. This is madness!}}
:{{Text|say|Rana|I am already home. And now, my home is in danger. I must protect it.}}

;Upon reaching the Slumbering Vault door
:{{Text|say|Rana|The lock is broken! They must already be inside.}}
:{{Text|say|Al'dalil|Quickly, [[Maw Walker]], see if you can open the door with this console!}}

;Upon entering the Slumbering Vault
:{{Text|yell|[[Xy'kaz]]|[[Cartel Al]]. You sit upon a wealth of knowledge and do nothing!}}
Xy'kaz cloaks and runs away.
:{{Text|say|Rana|No! What has he done?!}}
Al'dalil runs after Xy'kaz
:{{Text|say|Al'dalil|Bah! My device isn't working on his cloak. I will keep trying!}}
:{{Text|say|Rana|One of these buttons must turn it off!}}
