==Objectives==
Search [[Deathknell]] and the vicinity for 6 [[Scarlet Corpse]]s, then point at them so {{NPC||Darnell}} can pick them up.
*Scarlet Corpses gathered (6)

==Description==
We've been shipping in dead bodies from [[Silverpine Forest|Silverpine]], [[Hillsbrad Foothills|Hillsbrad]]... hell, anywhere we can get them from. We can't, however, afford to ignore the bodies which are sitting right on our front doorstep.

The last vestiges of the [[Scarlet Crusade]] roam here in [[Tirisfal Glades]]. While we've managed to push them from Deathknell, several of their bodies litter the buildings to the north and the east.

Go find them... and bring that Darnell fellow with you. He looks strong enough to carry a few corpses.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Flax Belt
|Rustmetal Bracers
|Short Duskbat Cape
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|||65}}
* 220 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Have you managed to scavenge up some corpses?

==Completion==
Great work <name>. I knew you weren't useless.

Here, take one of these. We [[deathguard]]s have piles of these things just sitting around.

==Notes==
[[File:Darnell and six Scarlet Corpses.jpg|thumb|How?]]

On accept:
:{{text|say|Darnell|Let's get moving, <name>. Saltain said that we'd find some corpses up here.}}
:{{text|say|Darnell|I think I see some corpses up ahead. Let's go, <name>! You do the searching and fighting. I'll do the lifting.}}

Look for Scarlet Crusader corpses, marked with yellow arrows. Interact with them and Darnell will pick them up.
