==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Darnell}} at [[Deathknell]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Description==
While you were inside that cave, your big friend Darnell came by with some alarming news.

Since the [[val'kyr]] arrived, we've seen more and more [[undead]] that chose not to join our forces under the banner of the {{NPC||Sylvanas Windrunner||Dark Lady}}. They've been gathering at a small camp here in the valley, and now they've organized forces.

They plan to attack Deathknell, <class>.

Darnell is just down the road, to the east. Be careful, <Name>. While those undead aren't completely brainless, they're still not quite right in the head.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Forsaken Dagger
|Forsaken Maul
|Forsaken Shortsword
|Forsaken Bastard Sword
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|||7}}
* 35 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

{{Itembox|
|q=5|Refreshing Spring Water}}

==Completion==
<Name>. You made it.

You see those tents up there? That's where we're headed. The battle's probably already started.

==Notes==
A few hundred yards to the east, just south of the road.

==Progression==
