==Objectives==
Deliver the Scarlet Crusade Documents to {{NPC||Deathguard Simmer}} at [[Calston Estate]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].
* [[Scarlet Crusade Documents]] (provided)

==Description==
<Sarvis produces a piece of paper from within his robes.>

These will need to be taken to my field agent, Deathguard Simmer. This information contains the whereabouts of the last few holdouts from the [[Scarlet Crusade]]. We will destroy these crusaders, once and for all. And I have a feeling you'll be instrumental in that effort, <name>.

Take the road north out of Deathknell. Soon after entering Tirisfal proper, you'll see a large manse. Simmer's inside.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||75}}
* 340 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Yes, what do you want?

==Completion==
Yes, this is very good. You've done well in obtaining this information, <name>. Hmm... names of the officers in the Tirisfal Glades...

Imagine the blow we could deal to the morale of those bloody zealots if we were to kill their leaders in one swift strike. I will pass this information forward.

==Notes==
Make sure to train before leaving the chapel, as players should have hit level 5 by this point. Exit Deathknell to the north following the road out past the blockade to the Tirisfal Glades proper. Keep heading to the northeast and cross the north-south road to reach the [[Calston Estate]], full of vendors, class trainers and the profession trainer, {{NPC||Therisa Sallow}}.

Step inside the mansion to turn in to the Deathguard, and note that {{NPC||Apothecary Johaan}} also has [[Fields of Grief]], which starts his quest chain.

==Progression==
{{Fresh out of the Grave}}

==Patch changes==
