==Objectives==
Kill 8 undead outside of [[Deathknell]]. You may kill either {{NPC||Wretched Ghoul}}s or {{NPC||Rattlecage Skeleton}}s.
*Deathknell Scourge slain (8)

==Description==
If you're going to be an asset to the [[Forsaken]], you need to learn how to fight. And there's no better target than the [[Scourge]] minions that continue to pester us.

The wretched [[ghoul]]s and Rattlecage [[skeleton]]s that roam the north and to the east are former troopers of the fallen Scourge. They should prove to be an even match for a fledgling <class> like you.

Do not tarry - when you are done, speak to me again.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Flax Boots
|Scavenger Tunic
|Roamer's Leggings
|Scavenger Vest
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 250 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Those who dally in this task might as well end up wandering about aimlessly like our fallen brothers and sisters in the village. Let's hope you will fare better than them, yes?

==Completion==
You're growing in strength, <name>. I've seen your type before. You will be moving out of Deathknell and on to greater things before long. Just make sure you don't lose sight of where you started.

You have much to accomplish, <class>.
