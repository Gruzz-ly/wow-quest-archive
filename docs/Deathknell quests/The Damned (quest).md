==Objectives==
Obtain 4 Scavenger Paws and 4 Duskbat Wings.
* [[Scavenger Paw]] (4)
* [[Duskbat Wing]] (4)

==Description==
First of all, look at your armor. You're a mess, <class>.

If you'd like to stay in one piece—and I've no doubt you do—perhaps I can help. If you can gather some paws and wings from the wolves and bats nearby, maybe I'll find some armor for you. You'll find the creatures to the north and to the west of here.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Flax Bracers
|Old Leather Belt
|Rusty Chain Belt
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Do try your best to keep yourself unharmed until I get you some armor.

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. This armor should help you out.

Hopefully, it should do you more good than the last one to wear it...

==Progression==
{{Fresh out of the Grave}}
