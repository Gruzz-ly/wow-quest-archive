==Objectives==
Obtain the Thick Embalming Fluid and the Corpse-Stitching Twine from the [[Shadow Grave]] in [[Deathknell]].
* [[Thick Embalming Fluid]]
* [[Corpse-Stitching Twine]]

==Description==
I'm pleased to see that you're up and walking around, <name>. You've held up nicely, especially after being dead for so long!

Others weren't as lucky. If you wouldn't mind, I need you to fetch my embalming fluid and some twine to stitch up these bodies. You'll find both in the Shadow Grave, the building just behind me.

Here, {{NPC||Darnell}} will join you. He knows the way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||15}}
*80 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
You will find the items within the Shadow Grave. I believe I left them on my work table.

==Completion==
Exactly what I needed. You'll be an asset to the [[Forsaken]], <name>.

You know, word has it that you were quite the <class> in your previous life. Perhaps I should assign you to a more exciting task.

== Notes ==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Darnell|Greetings, <name>.}}

Head off toward the crypt just to the south of Mordo's position.
:{{text|say|Darnell|The Shadow Grave is this way. Follow me, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Darnell|This way!}}
:''Darnell will start walking around the Shadow Grave, trying to find out where the items are. The items are on the table at {{co|29.7|72.0|Tirisfal Glades}} in the northwest corner, to the player's left.''
:{{text|say|Darnell|Let's see now... where could they be...}}
:{{text|say|Darnell|No, not over here.}}
:{{text|say|Darnell|Now, where could those supplies be?}}
:{{text|say|Darnell|Maybe they're over here?}}
:{{text|say|Darnell|Hmm...}}
:{{text|say|Darnell|Hey, give me a hand, <name>!  I can't find the supplies that Mordo needed!}}
:''After finding the items:''
:{{text|say|Darnell|Nice work! You've found them. Let's bring these back to Mordo.}}
:{{text|say|Darnell|I saw someone up there whose jaw fell off. I wonder if Mordo can fix him up?}}
