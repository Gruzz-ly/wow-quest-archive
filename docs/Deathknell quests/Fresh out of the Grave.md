==Objectives==
Report to [[Undertaker Mordo]] at the [[Deathknell Graves]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Description==
<Name>!

Rise, <name>!

Welcome back to the realm of the living. With the blessing and power from the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]], I have freed you from death's grip.

You are no slave, <name>. You are free to follow whatever path you choose from here. If you choose to serve the Dark Lady Sylvanas, I recommend you speak with Undertaker Mordo. You will find him behind me, in the graveyard.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||2}}
* 10 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
Hello there. You must be... <name>?

==Notes==
Just to the southeast.

==Beta description==
{{Rfb-section|Cataclysm}}
Hey! Wake up!

<The undertaker's assistant swings at you with a foul-smelling broom.>

Ahem...

"Welcome to the [[Forsaken]]. You now serve the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Lady Sylvanas Windrunner]]. Consider yourself lucky to have retained your sanity and free will beyond the grave. Many others like yourself instead became mindless [[Scourge]]."

There, now that that's over, why don't you go talk to my patron? He'll probably put you to work.
