==Objectives==
Find {{NPC||Lilian Voss}} inside the large inn in [[Deathknell]]. Then speak with her to show her Elreth's Hand Mirror.
* Show Lilian her Reflection
* [[Elreth's Hand Mirror]] (provided)

==Description==
Earlier on, I saw a young [[Forsaken]] woman running towards the old inn. She was screaming for her life, pleading to be taken back home.

Not all of us are as resolute as others, <name>. Even so, we must accept our fate as undead if we are to rise up against those that would put us down.

Take my hand mirror and show it to the young woman. She needs to see what she really is, and join us in our cause. Besides... we can use all the bodies that we can get.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||40}}
* 150 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Have you spoken with her yet? She needs to be shown the truth.

==Completion==
You say she ran away? What a shame.

Very well. As long as she's maintained her free will, there's still hope.

==Notes==
Lilian Voss is found in the left building on the other side of the chapel, cowering in a corner either upstairs or on the first floor.

:Get away from me, you monster! Don't look at me! I'm hideous!
:{{gossip|You're not hideous, Lilian... you're one of us. Here, look in this mirror, see for yourself.}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|You don't understand... I CAN'T be undead! Not me, not now...}}

==Progression==
{{Fresh out of the Grave}}
