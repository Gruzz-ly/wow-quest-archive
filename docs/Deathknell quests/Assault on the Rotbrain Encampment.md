==Objectives==
Kill Marshal Redpath and 8 Rotbrain undead.
* [[Marshal Redpath]] slain
* Rotbrain undead slain (8)

==Description==
While you were taking care of matters for {{NPC||Executor Arren}}, I went off on an assignment of my own. {{NPC||Shadow Priest Sarvis}} asked me to peek in on the Rotbrain camp.

There's a reason why they're called Rotbrains.

Their leader goes by the name of Marshal Redpath, and he's an absolute beast.

Look, <name>... the attack is starting. You're better in combat than I am. Get in there and help out!

When you're done, meet up with Shadow Priest Sarvis in the chapel. Good luck, <Name>.

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Executor Staff
|Deathguard Buckler
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||2}}
* 250 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
Being born again under the power of a [[val'kyr]] is a strenuous process. Many don't survive the shock, turning into [[zombie]]s or [[ghoul]]s.

Other retain just enough humanity to seem normal on the outside... but they're sick inside. We should have slain those rotbrains the day they were raised.

As for you... you're a strong <class>, <name>, I knew you'd do well. You'll be headed out of [[Deathknell]] soon.

==Notes==
Head south from Darnell's position.

{{NPC||Rotbrain Berserker}}s and {{NPC||Rotbrain Magus||Rotbrain Magi}} are busy attacking {{NPC||Deathguard Protector}}s. Help kill the rotbrain and seek out Redpath. He can be found at {{co|36.5|68.8|Tirisfal Glades}} in front of a tent on a hill away from the main camp.

Aggro Redpath:
:{{text|yell|Marshal Redpath|BLEEAAAGGHHH! I'm a monster, don't look at me!}}

Kill the required units then return to the chapel in Deathknell.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Shadow Priest Sarvis|Well, look who's here!}}
:{{text|say|Deathguard [[Darnell]]|Hi, <name>! What do you think about my new gear?}}
:{{text|say|Deathguard Darnell|They're making me into a [[Deathguard]]. Can you believe it?}}
:{{text|say|Deathguard Darnell|I'll probably be staying here in Deathknell. If things work out though... who knows? Maybe I'll get to meet the [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Dark Lady]] herself.}}
:{{text|say|Deathguard Darnell|How about you? I've heard that Sarvis is going to send you off to [[Calston Estate]]. Big assignment, eh?}}
:{{text|say|Deathguard Darnell|Well, I won't hold you up. It's been a pleasure, <name>. I hope our paths cross again soon.}}
