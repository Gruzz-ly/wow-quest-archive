==Objectives==
Kill 8 Young Night Web Spiders and 5 Night Web Spiders.
* [[Young Night Web Spider]] slain (8)
* [[Night Web Spider]] slain (5)

==Description==
One of our greatest struggles is obtaining the natural resources we need to survive. [[Gold]] was scarce in [[Lordaeron]], even in the height of the [[Alliance]]'s power so many years ago.

There is a [[gold mine]] to the west that has been overrun with [[spider]]s. We need gold from the mine, but we can't very well get it while the spiders are crawling around in there. I've not much manpower to commit to the task, so we'll just have to do it little by little.

Get up there and see what you can do for us, <name>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Flax Vest
|Rugged Plate Vest
|Zombie Skin Leggings
|Night Web Crossbow
|Abandoned Miner's Pants
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
Be wary of the spiders' venom, <name>. If you feel a sharp burning, you may want to have it looked at.

==Completion==
Well, it's a start. It'll take a few weeks or months to fully clean out the infestation. After that, we'll have to get down there with some torches to burn away the webbing.

You've done your duty well, <name>.

== Notes ==
The young spiders are on the surface above the mine, while the adult spiders are inside the mine itself.

==Progression==
