==Objectives==
Speak with Marshal Redpath, Lilian Voss, and Valdred Moray.
*Speak with [[Marshal Redpath]]
*Speak with [[Lilian Voss]]
*Speak with [[Valdred Moray]]

==Description==
King, peasant, or <class>... I don't care WHAT you were before. I just need somebody with a working tongue.

Being raised from the dead is strenuous. Not everyone copes with it as well as you did. In particular, there are three newly-raised undead who are having trouble coping right now.

I want you to find them and talk to them. It might be that they just need someone that they can relate with.

You'll find them here in the graveyard.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||12}}
* 60 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
No dilly-dallying now. You're among the [[Forsaken]] now, and we hold ours to a higher standard.

==Completion==
You've done well, <class>. As you can see, not all of us have resigned to our fates. I'm glad to see that you're at least willing to work.

Valred will be a valuable asset to the Forsaken. As for the other two... there is not much we can do. We cannot force them to join us.

==Notes==
[[File:The Wakening.jpg|thumb|The three marked NPCs]]
Accepting this quest makes you unable to get the quest [[Caretaker Caice]] from [[Undertaker Mordo]].

Talking to Marshal Redpath, abandoning the quest then accepting it again will make you unable to talk Marshal Redpath. Relogging will fix this.

From Caice's position, look to the north-northwest to see three NPCs marked with yellow arrows.

;Valdred Moray:
:What... what's going on? Who are you? What happened to me?
:{{gossip|Don't you remember? You died.}}
:I... died?
:Yes, you're right. I died. It was an orc... he cut off my hands, and left me to die.
:<Valdred looks down at his hands.>
:These aren't my hands! THESE AREN'T MY HANDS!
:{{gossip|Calm down, Valdred. Undertaker Mordo probably sewed some new ones on for you.}}
:<Valdred looks back down at his hands.>
:I suppose this is my fate then. Hah! Part of an undead army. Somehow I never considered that I might end up fighting for the Forsaken.
:<He looks back up at you.>
:What do I do now?
:{{gossip|You talk to Undertaker Mordo. He'll tell you what to do. That's all I know.}}
:{{text|say|Valdred Moray|I see. Well then, let's get to work, <name>! The Dark Lady needs us, right?}}
:''Valdred slowly walks over to Mordo's position.''
:{{text|yell|Valdred Moray|Valdred Moray, reporting for duty, sir!}}

;Lilian Voss:
:Get away from me, you abomination!
:{{gossip|I'm not an abomination, I'm simply undead. I just want to speak with you.}}
:The undead are a taint upon [[Azeroth]]! Every one of you creatures deserves to be destroyed!
:{{gossip|Lilian, do you realize that you are undead yourself?}}
:{{text|say|Lilian Voss|No. You're lying! My father will protect me!}}
:''Lilian runs off toward Deathknell.''

;Marshal Redpath:
:Stand back, monster. You want a fight? Because I'll fight you.
:I'll fight any one of you creatures! Do you hear me?
:{{gossip|I'm not here to fight you. I've only been asked to speak with you.}}
:Oh really?
:Fine. I don't want to join you and your Forsaken. Maybe I'll start my own Forsaken! Maybe I'll invent [[World_of_Warcraft:_Shadowlands#New_character_customization|Forsaken with elbows!]]
:{{gossip|You are free to do whatever you like.}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Redpath|Who are you calling a monster? You're the monster! I'm just a man who died.}}
:''Redpath runs off to the east.''

==Beta version==
{{rfb-section|Cataclysm}}
During the [[beta]] of ''Cataclysm'', Marshal Redpath's dialogue was different. He was initially portrayed as simply a rebel, holding a massive hatred for the [[Forsaken]] and vowing vengeance for [[Southshore]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYiTYdKaKFg  Cataclysm Beta - Brand New Valkyr filled Forsaken Starting Zone Deathknell]</ref>
:Stand back, monster. You want a fight? Because I'll fight you.
:I'll fight any one of you creatures! Do you hear me?
:{{gossip|I'm not here to fight you. I've only been asked to speak with you.}}
:Oh really?
:Fine. I don't want to join you and your Forsaken. Your Forsaken destroyed my home town of Southshore. You killed my [[Bolvar Fordragon|Highlord Bolvar]]... nearly lost us the [[war against the Lich King]].
:You're no better than your Scourge cousins.
:I want to leave this place. NOW.
:{{gossip|You are free to do whatever you like.}}
:{{text|say|Marshal Redpath|So i'm free to go? Fine. You haven't seen the last of me, monster.}}
:''Redpath runs off to the east.''
