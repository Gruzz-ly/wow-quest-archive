==Objectives==
Report to {{NPC||Executor Arren}}.

==Description==
I can keep you busy here in town all week... but you seem to be more the fighting type.

<Elreth looks you over and nods.>

Yes, you'll do just fine. I'd like you to go talk to Executor Arren. Follow the path north, out of Deathknell. You'll find him not far past the barricades.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|||25}}
* 130 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
What do we have here? A fledgling <class>, ready for battle, eh?

==Notes==
Exit the church and follow the road north. As it curves to the east, Arren can be found by a Forsaken banner just off the road.

==Progression==
{{Fresh out of the Grave}}

==Patch changes==
