==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Shadow Priest Sarvis}} at [[Deathknell]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Description==
Are you still here, <name>? You know, I'm only a [[deathguard]]. I don't have many tasks I can hand out to passers-by like you.

I'd recommend that you talk to Shadow Priest Sarvis. I remember, he helped me get on my feet after I was plucked out of that tomb. I'm sure he'll do the same for you.

You'll find him just inside the chapel, here on the west side of town.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 15 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Greetings, <name>.

I see you wield a weapon. Can you fight?

==Progression==
