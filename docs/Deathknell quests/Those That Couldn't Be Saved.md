==Objectives==
Kill 6 Mindless Zombies.
* [[Mindless Zombie]] slain (6)

==Description==
The [[val'kyr]] raise hundreds of corpses every day. {{NPC||Agatha}} raised you just a few moments ago. Not all are as lucky as you, however.

Some maintain their free will, but live in constant fear and confusion. They usually run off into the woods, cowering at their own reflections.

Others lose their minds completely, shambling about aimlessly. They often turn to violence, and must be destroyed.

This is your task, <name>. Destroy them, our former brothers and sisters as they might be.

== Rewards ==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Flax Gloves
|Battered Cloak
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||8}}
* 100 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Progress==
You will not go far in this new life if you are unable to kill even the weakest, most brainless creatures, <name>. Do not return until you have success to report.

==Completion==
Not even the power of the val'kyr was enough to save these creatures. They were doomed from the beginning.

I have obtained some equipment for you, <name>. It's not much, but it will help. Please, take your pick.

==Progression==
