==Objectives==
Speak with {{NPC||Deathguard Saltain}} at [[Deathknell]] in [[Tirisfal Glades]].

==Description==
{{NPC||Darnell}} tells me that the two of you have already met. That's good, because I'm sending you both into Deathknell. Your work is done here.

Speak with Deathguard Saltain in Deathknell, to the north. He will tell you more of what you must know.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 40 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Undercity (faction)|Undercity]]

==Completion==
Those [[val'kyr]] have been really busy resurrecting you newbies lately. I've already seen a couple dozen new bodies run down that hill since this morning.

You, however, are the most promising <class> I've seen today.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Darnell|Hello again.}}

Start running toward Deathknell.
:{{text|say|Darnell|I know the way to Deathknell. Come with me!}}
:{{text|say|Darnell|Good, you're still here. Now, where's Deathguard Saltain?}}
:{{text|say|Darnell|Ah, here he is.}}
