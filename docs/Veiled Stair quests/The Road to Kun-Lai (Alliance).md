==Objectives==
Travel through the [[Veiled Stair]] to [[Binan Village]].
* Speak with the [[Highroad Grummle]] {{co|70.1|23.5|Valley of the Four Winds}}
* Speak with [[Brewmaster Boof]] {{co|51.9|43.8|Veiled Stair}}
* [[A Missive from Lorewalker Cho]] (provided)

==Description==
Ah! Greetings friend of [[Lorewalker Cho]]. I have a message for you.

<The [[grummle|strange little creature]] hands you a battered scroll case.>

The Lorewalker waits for you in [[Kun-Lai Summit|Kun-Lai]]. Very dangerous to travel there, yes, very dangerous.

Look for guides along the road to help you find your way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|2}}
* 12900 XP

==Progress==
More strangers? This day is testing my limits.

==Completion==
Oh, you are a friend of Cho's? Welcome! Welcome!

I would serve you a banquet but as you can see we are in dire straights at the moment.

Say, would you be willing to lend us a hand?

==Notes==
A [[Messenger Grummle]] can be found at various locations in [[Valley of the Four Winds]], including [[Stoneplow]], [[Halfhill]], and the [[Grassy Cline]]. Any of them offer this quest.

{{book|A Missive from Lorewalker Cho|content=<Name>,

Your companions that survived the battle with the [[Sha of Doubt]] are now in the care of [[Binan Village]], home to Pandaria's finest healers. It looks as though they shall recover their physical injuries.

The journey to Binan will take you up the [[Veiled Stair]] to the very doorstep of [[Kun-Lai Summit]]. I urge you to bring this missive to {{NPC||Mayor Bramblestaff}} in Binan Village. There, he can direct you to your companions.

I look forward to our paths crossing again.

Get to the [[Grassy Cline]] and run up the [[Path of a Hundred Steps]] on the [[Veiled Stair]]. Pick up the flight path at the [[Tavern in the Mists]], then keep running north up the [[Spring Road]] to reach the entrance of the [[Ancient Passage]]. Hop in the boat waiting, ''[[The Spring Drifter]]'', for a free ride to the far side.

Get to the [[Grassy Cline]] and speak with the [[Highroad Grummle]] before running up the [[Path of a Hundred Steps]] on the [[Veiled Stair]]. Pick up the flight path at the [[Tavern in the Mists]], then keep running north up the [[Spring Road]]. On the way is [[Len the Whisperer]], who offers two side quests: [[Robbing Robbers of Robbers]] and [[Educating Saurok]]. Do them, or not, then keep heading north to reach the entrance of the [[Ancient Passage]]. Speak with [[Brewmaster Boof]], then hop in ''[[The Spring Drifter]]'' for a free ride to the far side via [[The Spring Drifter (quest)]].

On reaching Brewmaster Boof:
:{{text|say|Brewmaster Boof|Hey there. I don't think you want to go down that tunnel on foot. The saurok are out in force today and they are mighty territorial.}}

Reaching Mayor Bramblestaff:
:{{text|say|Mayor Bramblestaff|Welcome to Binan Village, <class>. I beg you... please help us.}}
