==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Leechfingers.jpg|Leechfingers|Shaman of the Hatescale}}
Defeat Leechfingers.
*[[Leechfingers]] slain {{co|51.1|43.4|Veiled Stair}}

==Description==
The [[Spring Road]] is under the protection of her ladyship, the esteemed [[Madam Goya]].

The [[saurok]] of [[Hatescale Burrow]] northeast of here require "education" in this fact. We have warned them before but sadly they seem to have a very short memory.

Travel northeast to this burrow and find their shaman leader. Eliminate him and you will have the gratitude of her ladyship. As well as an appropriate bounty.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|10|20}}
*129000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It is unwise to challenge the domain of Madam Goya.

==Completion==
The deed is done and a debt must be paid. Here is your reward. You have our gratitude.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Robbing Robbers of Robbers]] before heading out.

Head just northeast into the saurok cave. Stick to the left wall to reach the back of the cave, looting all of the artifacts along the way. [[Leechfingers]] is all the way in the back.

==Progression==
{{The Road to Kun-Lai}}
