==Objectives==
Seek out Wrathion outside the entrance to Blackwing Descent.
* Seek out [[Wrathion]] outside the entrance to [[Blackwing Descent]]
* [[Sleepless Interrogator]] slain
* [[Torn Journal Page 16|Wrathion's Journal Page collected]]

==Description==
Obviously, the Black Prince isn't here. Trust me when I say he's not an easy one to find.

If I were you, I'd make my way to [[Blackrock Mountain]]. There's a terrace carved into its slopes, where [[Nefarian]] once made [[Nefarian's Lair|his lair]].

Wrathion has been monitoring that place for a long time. Even if he's not there himself, you might find someone who knows where to look.

And <class>... it's clear you're not the only one searching for him. Watch your back.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Champions of Azeroth]]

==Progress==
My head is still spinning... they showed me... such terrible... tempting things...

==Completion==
Thank you. They... forced their way into my mind. I couldn't stop them from finding what they sought.

The Black Prince meant for you to have those pages. He was certain that you would need the knowledge within them.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Right|It seems you're not the only one on Wrathion's trail. Which must be why he's taken so many precautions.}}
:{{Text|say|Left|Not even we know where he is. But he's been keeping an eye on Blackrock Mountain. Might be a good place to start.}}
:{{Text|say|Left|Watch your back. Whoever else is looking for him, I doubt they just want to chat.}}

Head to the entrance to [[Blackwing Descent]], on the outside of [[Blackrock Mountain]]. There, a [[Blacktalon Watcher]] is being held captive by a [[Sleepless Interrogator]] and two [[Sleepless Operative]]s. Defeat them:
:{{Text|say|Sleepless Interrogator|[Shath'Yar] Hwr... whyrr...}}
:{{Text|say|Blacktalon Watcher|My head... they... reached into my mind...}}
:{{Text|whisper|Sleepless Interrogator|Too... late...}}

The watcher stumbles his way in the direction of the [[Meeting Stone]]. Speak with him:
:My mind... they saw into my mind. They know that the Black Prince expected you to come.

:I have failed him...

:{{Gossip|quest=|You're safe now. Did Wrathion leave a message for me?}}
:{{text|say|Blacktalon Watcher|He... left these for you... Said to seek him out in Karazhan.}}

The watcher provides [[Torn Journal Page 16]].
