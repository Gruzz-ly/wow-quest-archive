Recover 7 Black Market Merchandise.
*[[Black Market Merchandise]] (7)

==Description==
Ah, a <class>. I could make good use of your skills.

A convoy was struck just up the road by a band of marauding [[saurok]]. These marauders made off with some... merchandise... her ladyship, the [[Madam Goya]], had a mind to sell.

One does not steal from her ladyship.

If you recover these items I will gladly provide you a finders fee.

==Progress==
Saurok are seldom this bold.

==Completion==
Ah, our merchandise. Madam Goya will be pleased. You have the gratitude of her ladyship.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Educating Saurok]] before heading out.

Head just northeast into the saurok cave. Stick to the left wall to reach the back of the cave, looting all of the artifacts along the way. [[Leechfingers]] is all the way in the back.
