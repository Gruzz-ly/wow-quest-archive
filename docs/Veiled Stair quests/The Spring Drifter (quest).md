Survive a trip on the ''[[The Spring Drifter|Spring Drifter]]''.
*Survive a ride on the Spring Drifter

==Description==
Nobody really travels up the [[Ancient Passage]] on foot. That is just asking for a faceful of [[saurok]] if you are not careful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:

It is always good luck to have a [[grummle]] aboard when traveling through a saurok infested cave.

==Completion==
Wheh, we made it. Welcome to Binan Village.

==Notes==
Hop on.
:{{Text|say|Brewmaster Boof|Ever been to [[Kun-Lai Summit|Kun-Lai]] before? It's great. Long flowing farmlands. Beautiful mountains. And absolutely nothing dangerous whatsoever.}}

:{{Text|say|Brewmaster Boof|Well... yes. There are problems with the hozen.}}
:{{Text|say|Egg Shell|Tigers.}}
:{{Text|say|Brewmaster Boof|Yes, and the tigers.}}
:{{Text|say|Egg Shell|Darkhatched saurok are very dangerous, and very powerful.}}
:{{Text|say|Brewmaster Boof|The spears are just for show. As long as we don't get out of the boat or make eye contact or get hit by a spear then we should be fine.}}
:{{Text|say|Egg Shell|Saurok are very dangerous.}}
:{{Text|say|Brewmaster Boof|It's safe. I brought [[Lorewalker Cho]] and his strange companions up this way not long back.}}
:{{Text|say|Egg Shell|The "[[Nazgrim|orc]]" tried to punch me.}}
:{{Text|say|Brewmaster Boof|You had that coming. Waving your incense about in his face... wait a minute. Something doesn't feel right about this.}}
:{{Text|say|Brewmaster Boof|Are those refugees? What's going on over there? Do I hear fighting?}}
:{{Text|say|Brewmaster Boof|These people are farmers, not fighters! They may need our help!}}
