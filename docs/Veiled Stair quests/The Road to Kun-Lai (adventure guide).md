==Objectives==

* Speak with [[Brewmaster Boof]]

==Description==
[[Lorewalker Cho]] has sent word that several of your companions survived the conflict in the [[Jade Forest]] and have been moved to [[Kun-Lai Summit]] to seek healing.

They need your help if they are to survive!

To reach Kun-Lai Summit, travel to the [[Valley of the Four Winds]] and look for the Highroad Grummle that can be found at the base of the Veiled Stair along the northeastern border.

They can guide you the rest of the way.

==Rewards==
You will receive:

* 1,250 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Oh, you are a friend of Cho's? Welcome! Welcome!

I would serve you a banquet, but as you can see, we are in dire straights at the moment.

Say, would you be willing to lend us a hand?
