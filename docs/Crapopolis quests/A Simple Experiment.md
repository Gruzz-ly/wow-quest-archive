==Objectives==
Assist Hobart Grapplehammer.
* Listen to [[Hobart Grapplehammer]]
* Speak with Hobart Grapplehammer
* [[Freezing Console]] activated
* [[Flame Console]] activated
* [[Explosive Console]] activated

==Description==
Now that you've delivered the necessary parts, I can begin testing my latest prototype!

I call it the X-52 Personnel Armor! It will be nearly indestructible!

[[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]] has always coveted my inventions and now that he knows about the X-52 I'm sure he'll be up to no good. I've gotta complete the prototype before Gallywix comes up with a way to steal it out from under me!

I could really use an extra set of hands with the experiments.

Can I count on you, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We need to complete the X-52 Personnel Armor before Gallywix finds a way to steal the prototype!

==Completion==
Good work, <name>! The experiments were mostly successful! However, it does look like we'll need to find a new lab assistant for the explosives testing...

==Notes==

:''Hobart heads inside.''
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|If that bloviating buffoon thinks I'll simply surrender my greatest invention, then he is sorely mistaken!}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|The [[X-52 Personnel Armor]] will revolutionize the [[goblin]] arms industry!}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|With your help, I can finally commence the next phase of testing!}}

There are three [[Goblin Test Subject]]s.

;Speaking with Hobart Grapplehammer
:My Prototype X-52 body armor is nearly complete!

:{{Gossip|Let's begin the experiment.}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Test number one: Sub-zero temperatures!}}

Activate the [[Freezing Console]]:
:''The test subject is frozen in ice.''
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|This test simulates an environment that is an order of magnitude more frigid than [[Northrend]].}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Hmm. No vital signs from the test subject. But the armor remains intact. Success!}}

Activate the [[Flame Console]]:
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Test number two: Extreme thermal stress!}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|If we want this armor to withstand an explosion, then it certainly needs to be fireproof!}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|It seems we've lost another test subject. But the boots are unharmed! Progress!}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Test number three: DETONATION!}}

Activate the [[Explosive Console]]:
:{{Text|say|Goblin Test Subject|Wait! Wait! Hold up!}}
:{{Text|say|Goblin Test Subject|This ain't what I signed up for! I'm outta here!}}
:''The final test subject runs away.''
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Have you no respect for the scientific method?!}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Ugh... It's so hard to find good help these days!}}
