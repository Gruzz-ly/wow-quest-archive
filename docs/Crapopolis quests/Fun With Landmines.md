==Objectives==
Retrieve the refreshing coconut beverage from the minefield.
* X-52 Personnel Armor equipped
* [[Delicious Beverage|Refreshing coconut beverage]]
* [[X-52 Personnel Armor]] (provided)

==Description==
The prototype X-52 Personnel Armor is ready for the final test!

How are you with loud noises and sudden bursts of concussive energy, <name>?

For the final test, we're going to strap you into the X-52 Personnel Armor and have you traverse a minefield!

I have placed a refreshing coconut beverage in the center of the minefield. Consider the drink a fitting reward for reaching the oasis and surviving the inevitable explosions in the process!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Ballistic testing... IS MY FAVORITE!

==Completion==
These goons are demolishing my workshop! We've gotta do something fast!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Proceed to the minefield--I mean "testing area," as soon as you can!}}

Equip the armor and head to the area where the Coin-Operated Crowd Pummeler was originally fought.
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|The instructions for this test are simple: Traverse the minefield and retrieve the refreshing coconut beverage at the center!}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|You needn't worry about the mines. The X-52 will provide adequate protection from the explosions!}}

Go through the bombs until you reach the [[Refreshing Coconut Beverage]].
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Did you enjoy your drink? It appeared to pack quite the... punch!}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|I'll be waiting for you in my laboratory with the latest test results! Splendid work!}}

Back in the workshop, [[Gallywix]] and several [[Hired Scoundrel]]s are trying to take control. Hobart is throwing tools at him.
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Doesn't have to be this way, Hobart. Hand over the armor and this all goes away.}}
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Cease this at once, Gallywix! The armor isn't here!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|That so? Looks to me like it just walked through the door.}}
