==Description==
Although the [[X-52 Personnel Armor]]'s power-core was destroyed during the battle with [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]], the invention was a success!

I doubt anyone will be interested in purchasing the rights to the X-52 without a working power-core, so why don't you hang onto the armor instead? It is quite stylish after all!

Now that [[Crapopolis]] is saved and Gallywix is conveniently trapped inside of his own [[Crowd pummeler|mechanical pummeler]], I think I'm going to renegotiate that "contract" of his.

He is a "captive audience" after all!

==Rewards==
The following will be cast upon you:
*{{Abilities|Heritage of Kezan|id=313605|Collect the Heritage of Kezan  appearances.|icon=inv_chest_armor_goblin_d_01}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|46|80}}
* 22,300 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thank you for everything you've done for me, <name>! You've saved Crapopolis and put that no good, double-crossing Gallywix in his place!

Take the X-52 Personnel Armor along with my thanks. It looks good on you!
