==Objectives==
Speak with [[Crank Greasefuse]].

==Description==
I'm going to need some additional components in order to complete the next phase of testing.

Right now, what we need most are thermoplugs and thermoplug adaptors! I'll explain what they're for later...

Crank Greasefuse runs a shop near the entrance of the town. Go speak with Crank and get him to fork over the necessary parts.

I don't care what they cost, just tell him to bill me later! I can't be bothered to negotiate right now. I need to prepare the modifications to the [[X-52 Personnel Armor]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34|}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Thermoplugs, eh? Yeah I got some more here... but they ain't cheap!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|While you acquire the thermoplugs, I'll devise a new explosives test. Meet me at my storage facility when you return!}}
