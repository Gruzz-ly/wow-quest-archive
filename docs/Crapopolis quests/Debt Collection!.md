==Objectives==
Collect 8 Unpaid Debts.
* [[Unpaid Debt]] (8)

==Description==
You need thermoplugs? Well, you came to the right place, kid.

But I ain't giving 'em to you on credit. There's way too many shlubs who haven't paid me back the money they owe. I'm in over my head here, if I don't get paid fast, I'll be out of business in no time.

<Crank Greasefuse thinks for a moment.>

Look, I tell you what... If you can muscle those no-good goons into paying me my money, I'll give you the thermoplugs as payment.

You won't find a better deal than that!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You got my money?

==Completion==
<Crank Greasefuse takes a moment to count the money.>

It's all here! Good work, kid! The thermoplugs are all yours. Send my regards to Grapplehammer and tell him to name one of his inventions after me!

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Crank Greasefuse|Make those shady thugs pay up, and I'll get you those thermoplugs!}}

Find and interact with [[Shady Thug]]s:
:{{Gossip|Crank Greasefuse sent me. It's time to pay up!}}

Some give the debt immediately:
*{{Text|say|Here's the money! Just take it and go!}}
*{{Text|say|Don't hurt me! I'll turn my life around, I promise!}}
*{{Text|say|Greasefuse hired some muscle, eh? Fine... take the money!}}
*{{Text|say|I give up! Take the money!}}
*{{Text|say|I was gonna pay it back! I swear!}}
*{{Text|say|I'm not a bad person... I just do a lot of bad things!}}

Others turn hostile, attack, and have to be killed.
