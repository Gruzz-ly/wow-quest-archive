==Objectives==
Deliver the package to [[Hobart Grapplehammer]].

==Description==
A deal's a deal, <name>. Here's the thermoplugs you ordered!

Be sure to let that ol' grouch Grapplehammer know that I won't be giving out anymore handouts. If he needs more thermoplugs he'd better be ready to pay up.

Anyway, it was a pleasure doing business with you...

Now get lost!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|34}}
* 1,800 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Yes! These are exactly what I need to finish the landmines for the upcoming experiment...

Oh, I didn't mention landmines?

I thought I did... oh well! I'll explain everything later! It'll be fine!
