==Objectives==
Complete [[Hobart Grapplehammer]]'s experiment.
* X-52 Body Armor Equipped
* [[Mechanized Lab Assistant]] activated
* Mechanized Lab Assistant slain (1)
*[[X-52 Personnel Armor]] (provided)

==Description==
Now that we have the thermoplugs we're ready for our next test of the prototype X-52 Personnel Armor!

Unfortunately, my lab assistants have either quit or expired. What a pity! But their loss is your gain, <name>... now YOU get to wear the X-52 Personnel Armor!

How exciting!

The next test will be conducted by my new mechanized lab assistant. Head over to the main workshop and press the big red button to begin.

Don't worry, I'll be giving you directions over the X-52's built in intercom!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Everything depends on this experiment!

==Completion==
<Hobart Grapplehammer examines you closely.>

This is fantastic! You're currently suffering a moderate amount of internal bleeding, but the prototype X-52 Personnel Armor performed just as I predicted under extreme levels of repeated blunt force.

The X-52 doesn't have a scratch on it!
