==Objectives==
Defeat 8 Hired Scoundrels.
* [[Hired Scoundrel]] slain (8)
* Speak with [[Jastor Gallywix|Gallywix]]

==Description==
This is bad, <name>! Real bad!

Gallywix and his goons are destroying my workshop, but he's got another thing coming if he thinks I'm gonna hand over the [[X-52 Personnel Armor]]!

You've gotta get down there and clear out his goon squad before this place--AND ALL MY INVENTIONS--go up in flames!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hurry, <name>! Gallywix and his goons are destroying my worskshop!

==Completion==
Good work getting rid of Gallywix, <name>, but I've got a bad feeling about this. We need to find a buyer for the X-52 before Gallywix comes back.

Who knows what he'll try next...

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Your goons don't intimidate me! My assistant will handle them!}}
:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|We'll see about that!}}

The neutral Hired Scoundrels turn hostile. Kill them all.

:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|Ah come on, you gotta be kiddin' me with this!}}

;Speaking with Gallyiwix
:Well if it isn't, <name>. I can't say I'm surprised to see you here. You've been a thorn in my side for far too long...

:Maybe it's time I make the thorn disappear... for good!

:{{Gossip|I think it's time for you to leave, Gallywix.}}

:{{Text|say|Trade Prince Gallywix|This ain't over, Grapplehammer!}}
:''Gallywix leaves.''
:{{Text|say|Hobart Grapplehammer|Well done, assistant! That should buy us some much needed time.}}
