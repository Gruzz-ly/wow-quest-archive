'''Inform Leoroxx!''' Tell him what is happening to Mok'Nathal souls!

== Objectives ==
[[Spiritcaller Dohgar]] has implored you to inform [[Leoroxx]] about what the Razaani ethereal are up to. He can be found at [[Mok'Nathal Village]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].   

== Description ==
Quickly, you must inform Leoroxx of what is transpiring up at Razaan's Landing!

Those orbs were comprised of souls, some of them Mok'Nathal! 

== Completion ==
What you say, is it even possible?  What am I saying?  Of course it is, if the spiritcallers say so.

Remember before when I said that we might need your further assistance?  It would seem that I can tell the future.
