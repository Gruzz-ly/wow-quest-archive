==Objectives==
You have been asked by [[Tor'chunk Twoclaws]] to kill any 30 [[Bloodmaul]] Ogres at [[Bloodmaul Outpost]]. Return to him at [[Thunderlord Stronghold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] once you have done so.
*Bloodmaul Ogres killed (30)

==Description==
To the south of the Bladespire clan lies yet another threat: Bloodmaul Outpost.

While the Bloodmaul ogres are not the strongest clan in the mountains, not having the favor of the [[gronn]] known as [[Gruul the Dragonkiller]], they run a close second.

Now that we've dealt with winnowing the [[Bladespire clan|Bladespire]], it is time to turn our eye upon their rivals.

From [[Bladespire Hold]] head south through the ravine until you come to [[Bloodmaul Outpost]]. Slay as many of the Bloodmaul ogres in the vicinity as you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|3|50}}
* 11300 [[XP]] (or an additional {{cost|6|78}} at max level)

==Progress==
Bladespire or Bloodmaul, it matters not. All of the ogre clans fight against each other, vying for the dominance that comes with having the favor of Gruul the Dragonkiller.

Each is still our enemy, regardless of who that favor has fallen to, and we will drive them before us!

==Completion==
Your actions against both the Bladespire and the Bloodmaul ogre clans have gone a long way to securing Thunderlord Stronghold's future. We will not suffer those that would get in the way of our destiny here.

As you have done good work in destroying these ogres, I intend to reward you with the appreciation of the Horde.
