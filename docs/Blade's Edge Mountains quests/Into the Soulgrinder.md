==Objectives==
Retrieve Skulloc's Soul and deliver it to [[Mog'dorg the Wizened]] atop the tower at the [[Circle of Blood]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Skulloc's Soul]]
*[[Vim'gol's Grimoire]] (provided)

==Description==
The grimoire is the key to Skulloc's downfall.

Read aloud from the book at Soulgrinder's Barrow to initiate the ritual. An object known as the Soulgrinder will appear, as well as Skulloc's [[Sundered Spirit|ghostly victims]], who will try to destroy it. You must keep them from doing so long enough to force Skulloc fully into the world.

Find the barrow by heading north through the Daggermaw Canyon on the other side of the [[Circle of Blood]]. It is on the right side before [[Gruul's Lair]].
Bring back Skulloc's soul.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|13|20}}

==Progress==
Have you taken Skulloc's soul yet?

==Completion==

It is over then. &nbsp;You have freed us from the shackles of our enslavement to the Sons of Gruul. &nbsp;You have given the Bloodmaul Clan a reprieve from certain extinction.

Words cannot describe the extent of the debt that ALL of the ogres of the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]], Bloodmaul and Bladespire alike, owe you, <name>.

Look down, even now the ogres gather to pay you tribute. &nbsp;Let [[Gruul]] and his puppet, the old king, [[Maulgar]], cower within [[Gruul's Lair|their lair]]. &nbsp;Go to the ogres below as our new <king/queen>!

{{text|yell|Mog'dorg the Wizened|All hail, <name>, the new <king/queen> of the ogres!!!}}

''At this point, the area of the Circle of Blood will be surrounded by Bladespire Supplicants and Bloodmaul Supplicants, and all Ogres in Blades Edge Mountain will turn from {{text|red|Hostile}} to {{text|yellow|Neutral}}.''
