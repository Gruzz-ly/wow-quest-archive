==Objectives==
Use the Fistful of Feathers on the Lashh'an Spell Circle, then return to [[Daranelle]] at [[Sylvanaar]] before the kaliri spirit fades.
*Have Daranelle analyze the [[Kaliri]] aura
*[[Fistful of Feathers]] (provided)

==Description==
The pictograms indicate using feathers to cast the spell at one of the [[Circle of Power|circles of power]] in [[Veil Lashh]].

Confusing iconography seems to show an [[arakkoa]] being suffused with the spirit of a kaliri.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*8550 [[XP]] (or {{cost|5|13|}} at max level)

==Progress==
This is exciting! I can't wait to examine the workings of the spell.

==Completion==
I don't know what to say. This spell is very strange. It is not a simple conjuration or enchantment, but some sort of communion or communication spell.

I'm not sure what to make of it, <name>. I'll have to think about it some more.

But thanks for your help, anyways! I'm sure I'll think through this sooner or later.

==Notes==
Completing the spell buffs you with ''"Lash'an Channeling: You have been infused with the spirit of the kaliri."'' It will last for 10 minutes. On returning to Daranelle she will say:
:{{text|say|Daranelle|Good, <name>, you are under the spell's influence. I must analyze it quickly, then we can talk.}}
