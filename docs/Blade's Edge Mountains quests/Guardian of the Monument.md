==Objectives==
[[Chu'a'lor]] has asked you to obtain an Apexis Guardian's Head for him as proof. Return with it to him at [[Ogri'la]] atop the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] once you have done so.
* [[Apexis Guardian's Head]]

==Description==
You've figured out how to use the single-person relics, but as you may have seen, there are bigger ones, which they surround.

These larger [[Apexis Monument|apexis monument]]s function in much the same way, but they take 35 [[Apexis Shard|apexis shard]]s to activate.

Of greater concern to us are the guardians that are summoned through their use. These crystal constructs turned on their [[arakkoa]]n masters long ago, and now endanger Ogri'la.

We would ask that you destroy one and bring us proof. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|16|5|}}
* 4,150 [[XP]]
* +500 [[reputation]] with [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]]
* +500 reputation with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]

==Progress==
We abhor violence, but at least the construct that we have sent you against isn't a living being.

Speaking of which, do you have the head?

==Completion==
<Chu'a'lor beams at you with obvious respect.>

Not only are we impressed with the mental alacrity of you and your friends, but we are indebted to you, as is all of Ogri'la and the [[Sha'tari Skyguard|Skyguard]], for helping to protect our way of life here.

And remember, <name>, at any time you can gather others and return to any of those larger apexis monuments to make use of them; as long as you have enough apexis shards to power it that is.

==Notes==
The guardian spawns as soon as the [[Apexis Monument]] memory game is failed, so actually completing it is not required.

==Progression==
This quest seems to unlock after completing [[Our Boy Wants To Be A Skyguard Ranger]] in the main [[Ogri'la]] quest chain, as well as the side quest [[An Apexis Relic]].

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.3.0|note=Group requirement removed, quest text updated accordingly. (Previously recommended 5 players.)}}
*{{Patch 2.1.0|note=Added.}}
