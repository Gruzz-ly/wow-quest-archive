==Objectives==
Use the [[Bladespire Clan Banner|Bladespire Banner]] atop the [[Northmaul Tower]] to lure [[Gurn Grubnosh]]. Deliver the banner and the [[Helm of Gurn Grubnosh]] to [[Commander Skyshadow]] at [[Sylvanaar]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Bladespire Clan Banner]]
*[[Helm of Gurn Grubnosh]]
*Suggested Players [3]

==Description==
I want you to steal the [[Bladespire Clan Banner|Bladespire banner]] from one of their [[Bladespire Champion|champions]] and take it south to [[Bloodmaul Outpost]]. Plant it atop their Northmaul Tower.

This will infuriate the [[Bloodmaul]] and they will attack you relentlessly. But it will also keep their hatred focused on [[Bladespire Hold]], and away from Sylvanaar.

You will know you have accomplished the deed when you have defeated Gurn Grubnosh and taken his helm. Return it to Sylvanaar.

<Name>, this isn't going to be easy. Take a friend or two with you.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Sylvanaar Elite Caster's Armor
|Ogre Assassin's Britches
|Gurn's Horned Helmet
|Sylvanaar Champion's Shoulders}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|7|40}}
*14600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What brings you to me?  Surely not more trouble with the Bloodmaul ogre clan?

==Completion==
Gurn Grubnosh's helm and a Bladespire banner?

Quite clever of you and the vindicator to come up with that plan.

By keeping the attention of the Bloodmaul clan on Bladespire Hold, you've relieved the pressure that they were beginning to assert upon us here.

Please, <name>, accept a humble gift from Sylvanaar.
