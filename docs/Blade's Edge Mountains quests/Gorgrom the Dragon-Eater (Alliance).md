==Objectives==
Go to Boulder'mok and collect 3 Grisly Totems from the Boulder'mok ogres. Use Sablemane's Trap at [[Gorgrom's Altar]] to summon and kill [[Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater]].

When Gorgrom is dead, place the 3 Grisly Totems near his corpse, then return to [[Commander Haephus Stonewall]] at Evergrove in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. 
*Plant Grisly Totem (3)
*[[Sablemane's Trap]] (provided)

==Description==
We must show the ogres that we are not to be trifled with. We must send a message.

Travel to Boulder'mok and kill the ogres there. Make sure you keep their heads.

Then go to Gorgrom's altar and place the trap there for him. Gorgrom will appear, and you must lure him into the trap. When he is dead, mount your grisly totems near his corpse, so that the ogres may look at their fallen master and their fallen brothers, and know the price for seeking to destroy us.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Whistling Sword|Fanged Axe|Adjudicator's Staff}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|7|80|}}
*14950 [[XP]] (or {{cost|8|97|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Has the message been delivered?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Well done!

I suspect we will hear little more from the ogres and their master.

==Progression==
