==Objectives==
Slaughter 5 Boulder'mok Brutes and 3 [[Boulder'mok Shaman]], and then return to [[Tor'chunk Twoclaws]] at [[Thunderlord Stronghold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. 
*[[Boulder'mok Brute]] slain (5)
*[[Boulder'mok Shaman]] slain (3)

==Description==
I know that Rexxar has plans for you to head to Boulder'mok. I have something that I want you to do while you are there.

We must take any chance we can get to strike down the ogres of these mountains, or they will overrun us, and all that we have bled and died for will be for nothing!

Boulder'mok lies far to the northwest. Travel north to Ruuan Weald, and from there head west through the tunnel and past the Raven's Wood.

<Name>, I want you to kill the Bladespire ogres of Boulder'mok. Wipe them out!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|7|80}}
*14950 [[XP]] (or {{Cost|8|97}} at level 70)

==Progress==
We have come a long way in a short time, you and I. I dare say that you are the most capable ogre hunter that I have ever known.

I trust then that you will deal with the Boulder'mok ogres soon?

==Completion==
<Tor'chunk grins at the story that you tell him about your adventures at Boulder'mok.>

Ah, I wish that I could have been there with you. &nbsp;Let me tell you something, <name>: never accept any duty that keeps you from the glory of battle!

Hah! &nbsp;After all of the ogre killing that you've done, are there any still left in these mountains for me?!
