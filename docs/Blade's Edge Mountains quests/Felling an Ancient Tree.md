'''Felling an Ancient Tree''' sends the player after an [[Treant|Ancient of War]] near the Alliance outpost of [[Sylvanaar]].

==Objectives==
Acquire Stronglimb Deeproot's Trunk and deliver it to [[Tor'chunk Twoclaws]] at [[Thunderlord Stronghold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Stronglimb Deeproot's Trunk]]

==Description==
WANTED!

Stronglimb Deeproot, ancient of war and chief defender of the Living Grove south of Sylvanaar.

Find him by heading west across the bridge that traverses the Bloodmaul Ravine.

Return his hewn trunk to Tor'chunk Twoclaws inside the Thunderlord Stronghold inn.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of the following
|Bear-Strength Harness
|Boots of the Ancient-Killer
|Dark Deed Leggings
|Wild Horned Helm
}}

==Progress==
What's that you have there?  You're a strong one!

==Completion==
Stronglimb Deeproot's Trunk!  Did you chop him down by yourself?

I bet you did.  You know, Rexxar and I are looking for a young, strong <class>, such as yourself, to help out around here, especially with the problems we continually have with the ogres.  Make sure that you follow-up with me on that possibility.

Well that trunk's definitely proof, which means you're here to collect the bounty and not to listen to me talk.  Go ahead, take your pick.

==Notes==
Stronglimb Deeproot walks along the north-south path leading south from Sylvanaar. Be careful not to get too close to the Alliance town or the guards will attack.
