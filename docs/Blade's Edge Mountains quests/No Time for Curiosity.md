==Objectives==
Deliver [[Timothy Daniels|Timothy's]] [[Letter to Kialon]] at [[Sylvanaar]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Letter to Kialon]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, I have a favor to ask of you. Normally, I would do this myself, but my hands are already beyond full.

I have an associate named [[Kialon Nightblade|Kialon]] at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains to the north. He's expecting to hear from me in the near future, although I suspect he won't like what I have to say.

If you would deliver my response to him, you would have my gratitude. I must insist, and this is very important, that you not attempt to read the letter. It is for Kialon's eyes alone.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*2700 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|62|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
<Kialon eyes you suspiciously.>

I don't know you, <race>. Do you have business with me? 

==Completion==
So you've brought Timothy's response?

<Kialon pauses a moment to read the letter, then laughs.>

He's got everything under control, he says. Doesn't need help, he says. I could've predicted that!

Some people never change. Look, he even took the time to correct my spelling.

<Kialon lets out a half-hearted sigh.>

I shouldn't have sent the letter. I forgot. The specialist always has the situation under control. Always.
