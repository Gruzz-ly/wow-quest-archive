==Objectives==
Speak with [[Sky Commander Keller]] at the [[Skyguard Outpost]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. 

==Description==
<Name>, we were wondering if you might be willing to visit our friends just to the north at the Skyguard Outpost?

Sky Commander Keller and his [[Sha'tari Skyguard|Skyguard]] are here running missions for our mutual protection, and he's asked us to send along anyone that we feel would excel at helping out.

That would be you!

Head up there as soon as you can, and please, give him our regards.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||44|}}
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]

==Completion==
Welcome ta the Skyguard Outpost! &nbsp;I built it with me own hands ya know.

Yeah, the whole thing!

<The sky commander looks serious.>

So, ye must be lookin' ta spoil for a fight if ye're here talkin' ta me. &nbsp;It was kind of old [[Chu'a'lor]] ta send ye along. &nbsp;We can always use fresh meat for the grinder around here.

If ye don't mind, I'd like ya ta start by having a talk with my sergeant across the way: [[Sky Sergeant Vanderlip|Vanderlip]]. &nbsp;Don't mind her tongue, though it be sharper than the greatsword she be carrying.

==Notes==
When turning in this quest Sky Commander Keller calls you "...fresh meat for the grinder..." which is a line from the movie Starship Troopers.  "Fresh meat" in this context is a synonym for "rookie", or new member of a squad.
