'''A Boaring Time for Grulloc''' sends the player and a pig to steal from a gronn.

==Objectives==
Obtain Grulloc's Sack and deliver it to [[Baron Sablemane]] at the [[Circle of Blood]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Grulloc's Sack]]
*[[Huffer's Whistle]] (provided)

==Description==
<name>, I have a pet boar named [[Huffer]]. He wants to help you to have some fun with one of the nearby sons of Gruul.

Grulloc inhabits a place known as the Cursed Hollow. When you get there, let Huffer loose. The gronn will have a fine time chasing him around, and you will retrieve the bag that he guards and deliver it to Baron Sablemane.

To get to the Cursed Hollow, head down the northern ramp and east through Dragons' End. The hollow is on the eastern edge.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}

==Progress==
Back so soon?  Have you come to deliver that which Rexxar owes me?

==Completion==
<Baron Sablemane peers inside the gronn's sack and seems satisfied.>

Very well, you have upheld your end of the bargain. With that price paid, I will give Rexxar what he seeks.

==Notes==
*You want to get as close as possible to Grulloc before you release Huffer. There's a stone arch structure on the right/east side of the ravine which should put you close enough without aggroing Grulloc.
*Once Grulloc starts chasing Huffer, run in, grab the bag, and run out immediately. Huffer doesn't keep Grulloc occupied for long.

==Progression==
