==Objectives==
Collect and use a Vekh'nir Crystal at the Vekh'nir Spell Circle, then return the [[Charged Vekh'nir Crystal]] to [[Dertrok]] at the Mok'Nathal Village. 
*[[Charged Vekh'nir Crystal]]

==Description==
The arakkoa of Vekh'nir have been a thorn in our sides for many years. Some strange religion guides them, a religion which has the arakkoa in a frenzy of activity. They carry these crystals with them now, which they have turned to some dark purpose.

I know something of their rituals. They take the crystals to their [[Circle of Power|spell circles]] to infuse them. We at the village would like to know more. Waylay a few of the arakkoa until you find a crystal, charge it, then return it to me. 

==Progress==
The Vekh'nir arakkoa have been benign for many years, but now something has stirred them.
 
==Completion==
Ah, look how it glows! I must try this at once.

==After completion==
Dertrok: [[Cansis]], hold still. I'm going to try to use this crystal.<br/>
Dertrok: *waves crystal around, putting Cansis under a concussive (hypnosis) spell*<br/>
Dertrok: Interesting... Let me try something.<br/>
Cansis. You are a chicken.<br/>
Cansis: *flaps arms like a chicken*<br/>
Dertrok: Fascinating.<br/>
Cansis: *breaks out of trance*<br/>
Cansis: If you ever do that again, I will break your neck.

==Gains==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*5650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|3|39|}} at level 70)
