'''It's a Trap!''' The adventurer find out what the Baron has planned for a gronn.

==Objectives==
Deliver the Dragonfire Trap to [[Rexxar]] at [[Thunderlord Stronghold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Dragonfire Trap]] (provided)

==Description==
There's is no cause of fury greater in this world than that of [[Gruul]] and his sons. They slaughtered my people - my children - and now I will have revenge.

I have fashioned a trap from dragon fire, and if you're clever enough, you can use it to kill even a [[gronn]].

Just hurry, take the trap to Rexxar. My thirst for revenge must be quenched.

==Progress==
Did you recover whatever was in that gronn's sack for [[Sabellian|Sablemane]]? What has he given us?

==Completion==
Hmm, a trap fashioned from the essence of dragon fire? I wonder how Sablemane comes by such rarified substances?

It does not matter. What does matter is that we are going to use it to slay a son of Gruul.
