'''Maintaining the Sunwell Portal''' is part of the [[Shattered Sun Offensive]] storyline. A flying mount is required to complete this quest. Once players have activated the [[Sunwell]] portal, this quest replaced [[Intercepting the Mana Cells]].

==Objectives==
Obtain 10 Smuggled Mana Cells and return them to [[Exarch Nasuun]] on the [[Terrace of Light]] in [[Shattrath City]].
*[[Smuggled Mana Cell]] (10)

==Description==
We must maintain the energy to our portal or it will collapse. The mana cells that the ethereal at [[Bash'ir Landing]] have hidden will continue to serve our purposes. The landing sits atop the northwestern corner of the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]], far to the north.

Remember, acquire a phase device from one of the [[ethereal]] and then use it to locate the smuggled goods.

Just be cautious of the [[Phase Wyrm|phase wyrms]] that they use to guard the mana cells.

==Rewards==
You will receive: [[Shattered Sun Supplies]] and {{cost|4|40}}.

==Progress==
<name>, how fare your efforts to obtain mana cells for us this day?

==Completion==
These mana cells will continue to power the portal.

Return tomorrow and I will send you out to obtain more.

==Notes==
As the quest text hints at, the mana cells are hidden. All [[ethereal]]s in the area may drop the [[Bash'ir Phasing Device]] which will put the caster, party members and pets in a phased state that allows them to see the mana cells (which look like pale glowing purple boxes) and hide from the ethereals and other wildlife in the area, but allows nearby phase wyrms to attack the players and vice versa. Players can mount up and fly around or do any of the rest of their abilities while phased, but once players leave Bash'ir Landing, the buff will fade.
