==Objectives==
Deliver Gorgrom's Favor to [[Commander Haephus Stonewall]] at Evergrove in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Gorgrom's Favor]] (provided)

==Description==
A token in the form of a small statuette falls from Dorgok's dead clutch. It bears a striking resemblance to one of the gronn.

Surely, [[Commander Haephus Stonewall]] at Evergrove in the Ruuan Weald, up the ramp to the east, would be interested in this!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||69|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Hello, lad, what news do you bring?

==Completion==
Oh, now that's pretty. Looks a lot like those gronn that are always bossing the Bladespire ogres around.

Odd that you should find it in the hands of one of the Bloodmaul leaders.

==Progression==
