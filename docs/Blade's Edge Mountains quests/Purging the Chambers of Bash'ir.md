'''Purging the Chambers of Bash'ir''' allows you turn in 5 [[Ethereum Prison Key]] to receive a [[Ethereum Stasis Chamber Key]] to open the [[Ethereum Stasis Chamber]]s at [[Bash'ir's Landing]]. 

The mobs which spawn from these Chambers have a chance to drop [[Mark of the Nexus-King]] which is required for [[The Mark of the Nexus-King]].

This is a repeatable quest, as you may need to open many [[Ethereum Stasis Chamber]]s to obtain the Mark. You will need to obtain a [[Mark of the Nexus-King]] to further the quest chain.

==Objectives==
*[[Ethereum Prison Key]] (5)

==Description==
We're at an impasse here, <name>. The data you've collected has given us enough information to save our allies being held at the smaller prisons of [[Netherstorm]] but we must press forward and eradicate the larger [[Ethereum]] threats here at [[Bash'ir's Landing]].

Join the battle against the Ethereum! Bring Ethereum prison keys to me and I shall forge Ethereum stasis chamber keys for you to use on the stasis chambers of Bash'ir.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40}}
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Consortium]]
*[[Ethereum Stasis Chamber Key]]

==Completion==
There is always more work that must be done, <name>. Now seek out a stasis chamber and destroy whatever evil lurks within!
