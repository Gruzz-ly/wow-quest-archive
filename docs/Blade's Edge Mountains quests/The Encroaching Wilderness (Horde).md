==Objectives==
Gor'drek has asked you to slay 12 Bladewing Bloodletters. Return to him at [[Thunderlord Stronghold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] once you have accomplished that.
*[[Bladewing Bloodletter]] slain (12)

==Description==
The Thunderlord were once a proud orc clan before they were transformed into fel orcs through the blood of Mannoroth.

Recently we recovered this orc stronghold from the ogres that infest the ravine below. They had moved in when the Thunderlord clan abandoned it.

We will keep this place and I will have your help doing so.

In the Jagged Ridge to the south and the west, there are bloodletters that have become like a plague upon us. They eat and breed incessantly.

Kill them and then return to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Our survival here depends upon our ability to concentrate our efforts against those that truly matter, not the mere bladewing bloodletters.

You are here again, so this must mean that you have dealt with the matter at hand?

==Completion==
That didn't take as long as I thought it would. &nbsp;Are you sure that you dealt with as many as was necessary?

Very well, there's something else that I want you to help us with. &nbsp;Something far more important.
