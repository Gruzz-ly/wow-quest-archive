'''The Totems of My Enemy''' sends the adventurer to take the totems of the [[Bladespire]] Ogres.

==Objectives==
Collect 5 Bladespire Totems for [[Spiritcaller Dohgar]] at [[Mok'Nathal Village]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Bladespire Totem]] (5)

==Description==
There is the right way to honor one's ancestors, and there is the wrong way.

The Bladespire ogres carry totems with them, but they do not use them to show their respect. Instead, they seek to use them to manipulate and control.

We should steal their totems because they are unworthy! We will then put them to better use.

Go to the Bladespire Outpost to the west, just southwest of the Razor Ridge. Slay the Bladespire mystics and crushers, and take their totems from them!  

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}
*11650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you gone to Bladespire Outpost and taken their totems from them?  

==Completion==
This looks like a good assortment.  We should be able to find a respectful use for one or two of them.

In fact, I have an idea for how to do just that!

==Notes==
The totems can drop from any of the Bladespire ogres. They have a drop rate of around 20%.
