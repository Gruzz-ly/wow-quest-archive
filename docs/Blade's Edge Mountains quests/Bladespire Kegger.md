==Objectives==
T'chali has asked you to take the Bloodmaul Brutebane Keg and use it in an attempt to get 5 Bladespire Ogres drunk. If successful, return to [[T'chali the Witch Doctor]] at [[Bloodmaul Ravine]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*Bladespire Ogres drunk (5)
*[[Bloodmaul Brutebane Keg]] (provided)

==Description==
As T'chali was saying, he helped out his Bloodmaul friends to make their brew. But what T'chali did not say was why.

The Bloodmaul are in dire straits. The Bladespire clan be crushing them, and they needed a new weapon to help out with their fight.

That's when T'chali came up with a great idea. Why not make the perfect brew, one that strengthens you and weakens your enemy? Only thing is, T'chali does not know if it works.

So, you gonna take this brew up to Bladespire Hold and see if it works!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Tell T'chali... did the brew work? &nbsp;Did the Bladespire ogres like it?

==Completion==
That's good news! &nbsp;That brew is gonna come in handy with what T'chali is gonna ask you to do next.

==Notes==
This quest is a pain because to get them to 'aggro' the brew, you have to be just barely outside their aggro range. If they come after you, they won't go after the mug. But as long as they see the mug first and talk about it, they can aggro on you afterward and you still get credit for it.

It is possible to 're-beer' the same ogre over and over again, if you find a good spot to drop it. He'll drink, wobble, then reset.
