==Objectives==
[[Toshley]] would like you to use the [[Multi-Spectrum Light Trap|Light Trap]] to catch 15 Razaani Light Orbs. Return to him at [[Toshley's Station]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] after you have done so.
*Razaani Light Orbs trapped (15)
*[[Multi-Spectrum Light Trap]] (provided)

==Description==
The Razaani [[ethereal]]s have been playing with some interesting technology at [[Razaan's Landing]] to the north.

I'm sure they won't mind if you use this trap to take a few samples of their little pink floating light orbs? They're probably only for decoration anyway.

The trap has a special property to it that when opened should attract one of the floating balls towards it. Of course, it'll probably also alert the Razaani to your presence. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}
*11650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I take it that since we're speaking, you have the light orbs from the Razaan's Landing?  It'll be interesting to take a look at them and see what the ethereal are up to.

==Completion==
Hey!  Wait just one damned minute!!

This doesn't look good...
