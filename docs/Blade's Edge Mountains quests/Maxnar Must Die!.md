==Objectives==
On behalf of the Cenarion Expedition druids of Evergrove, and the indigenous life of the Ruuan Weald, [[Tree Warden Chawn]] has asked you to slay [[Maxnar the Ashmaw]]. Return to him at Evergrove in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] after you have done so.
*[[Maxnar the Ashmaw]] slain

==Description==
They've left us no choice, <name>. It's time to put an end to the threat from Blackwing Coven by taking out their leader, [[Maxnar the Ashmaw]].

I don't know if you caught a glimpse of him while you were in there, but he's one of the dragonkin, half-man, half-dragon. And he's tough, so don't underestimate him!

Finish it quickly and with any luck you'll secure the safety of Evergrove and the Ruuan Weald.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
: [[Coven Britches]]
: [[Chest of the Wyrmcult]]
: [[Dragonkin Shirt]]
: [[Blackwing Helm]]
You will also receive:
*{{cost|7|80|}}
*14950 [[XP]] (or {{cost|8|97|}} at level 70)
*350 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
You've dealt with Maxnar the Ashmaw already?

Are you having trouble finding him?  As I understand it if you head to the right once you enter their caverns, it will eventually curve around and lead you to him.

==Completion==
Now we can breathe more easily knowing that the leader of our enemy has been dealt with. &nbsp;Not only that, but you've saved the entire mountain range from their depredations.

Whatever their ultimate goals, you've foiled them!

You have our gratitude, <name>. &nbsp;Please accept this token of our esteem, as well as our unending hospitality.
