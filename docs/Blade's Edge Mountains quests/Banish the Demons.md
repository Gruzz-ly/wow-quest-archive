You must be {{reputation|Honored}} with [[Ogri'la]] to be eligible for this quest. This used to be the entry point to starting the [[Shartuul's Transporter (event)|Shartuul's Transporter]] event, but with its removal, the quest simply serves to unlock the daily version of itself, [[Banish More Demons]], as part of the [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]] reputation grind.

==Objectives==
Kronk has asked you to use the Banishing Crystal to banish 15 demons at [[Forge Camp: Wrath]] or [[Forge Camp: Terror]] atop the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. Return it to him once you have done so.
* [[Banishing Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
You've arrived at the perfect time, friend! We are in need of assistance. In return, you will receive something very rare, which will help us both in the end.

We're not a violent ogre any longer, but the demons nearby threaten to overrun us and the [[Sha'tari Skyguard|Skyguard]]. The problem with demons is that, once killed, they come right back in new bodies!

But, if you use this crystal to summon a banishing portal, when they die near it, their essences will be drawn in and banished back from whence they came!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|4|40}}
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]]
* +350 reputation with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]
* [[Darkrune]] ''(pre-[[patch 4.1.0|4.1.0]])''

==Progress==
We trust that you've used the banishing crystal to send a whole slew of those [[Burning Legion]] things packing?!

==Completion==
That'll teach them!

===Original version===
{{classic only-section|tbc|patch=4.1.0}}

That'll teach them! And, of course, now for your reward.

The demons of [[Forge Camp: Wrath]], to the north, have created a special transporter on their southern border. This experimental gate is being used to expand the forge camp, and we don't think we need to tell you how that will effect us if they expand too far.

However, if we were you, we'd take this [[Darkrune|darkrune]] over to Gahk, and ask him [[Shartuul's Transporter (event)|how you can help]]. Just take it easy on him, <name>. Like you, he's new here.

==Notes==
To banish a demon, create a portal by using the Banishing Crystal. Defeat demons near the portal during its three minute duration. In the right location, 7 to 8 demons could be fairly easily pulled and killed next to one portal, completing the quest with only two uses of the Crystal. New portals can be created once per minute, but each use consumes one [[Apexis Shard]].

Killing a Gan'arg counts as banishing a demon. Killing a hellboar, humanoid cultist or cannon does not.

The mobs at [[Forge Camp: Wrath]] do less damage than those at [[Forge Camp: Terror]].

The "soul" of the enemy demon always goes to the portal next to it (which is indicated by a faint crackling purple lightning effect), regardless of who [[tap]]ped the monster.

==Progression==
Requires {{rep|Honored}} status with [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]], probably starting with the [[Ogre Heaven]] quest chain. Then:
# [[Banish the Demons]]
#* Unlocks: [[Banish More Demons]]
# {{Strike|[[A Crystalforged Darkrune]]}}
#* Unlocks: {{Strike|[[Yous Have Da Darkrune?]]}}
# {{Strike|[[Shartuul's Transporter (event)|Shartuul's Transporter]]}} (event)

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 4.1.0|note=No longer awards a [[Darkrune]] with the removal of [[Shartuul's Transporter (event)|Shartuul's Transporter event]].}}
*{{Patch 2.1.0|note=Added.}}
