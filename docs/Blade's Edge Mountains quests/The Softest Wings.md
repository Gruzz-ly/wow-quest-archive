== Objectives ==
Silmara at Mok'Nathal Village wants you to collect 12 Iridescent Wings. 
*[[Iridescent Wing]] (12)
==Description==
Hunting [[Mature Silkwing|silkwing]] larva is a difficult challenge for our young warriors, but luckily, even if they fail to harvest the cocoon from the larva, we can still use the wings of hatched silkwings.

In fact, we use the wings for much more than the cocoons, and we can never have too many.

If you'll be out there, it would be a great help if you could bring me some.

==  Reward ==
You will receive:{{cost|3|30|}}
==  Progress ==
The wings are quite delicate, but can be inlaid as a decorative element in many of our designs. 
==  Completion ==
Thank you, &lt;name&gt;. We will use these sooner than you might think. 
==  Gains ==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at level 70)
