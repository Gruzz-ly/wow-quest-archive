==Objectives==
Kill [[Bladespire]] ogres to get the [[Wyvern Cage Key]]. Once you have it, go to the [[Wyvern Cage]] and use Spirit's Whistle to summon [[Spirit (hawk)|Spirit]], who will unlock the cage. After [[Leokk]] is free, return to [[Rexxar]] at [[Thunderlord Village]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Spirit's Whistle]] (provided)
*Suggested Players: 3

==Description==
Shortly after my arrival in the mountains, I came under attack by a group of Bladespire ogres.

Though I fought free of them, and slew many, they took my wyvern, Leokk, captive. Spirit has found him, locked in a cage in the heart of the Bladespire encampment outside of [[Gruul's lair]].

One of the ogres must carry his key. Find it and Spirit can use it to unlock Leokk's cage.

You will find the encampment at the north end of the [[Daggermaw Canyon]] down below.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}

==Progress==
It will be good to have Leokk's aid once again.

==Completion==
Leokk has brought to us the head from one of the black dragons at [[Dragon's End]]. With this, we will be able to infuriate [[Goc]], the [[gronn]] that captured him, and lure him into battle.

==Notes==
*The ogres you need to kill are elites outside Gruul's Lair. The drop rate for the key seems to be rather low.
*Once you have the key, you need to get close enough to Leokk's cage (location 64,21) to summon Spirit.
*You only need to get one key. Once the wyvern is released by one person, anyone else on the quest will get credit.
