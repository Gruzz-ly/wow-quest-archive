==Objectives==
[[Toshley]] has asked you to take the Protovoltaic Magneto Collector and gather up 5 [[Electromental]]s. Return to him at [[Toshley's Station]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] after you have done so.
*[[Encased Electromental|Electromentals collected]] (5)
*[[Protovoltaic Magneto Collector]] (provided)

==Description==
Those dumb ogres at the [[Bladespire Outpost]] to the north have been raiding our power converters! And you're going to get them back for me, sort of.

No doubt, with their big, clumsy hands, the ogres have damaged the converters. So, what I want you to do is release the energy from them and then use this protovoltaic magneto collector on the resultant electromental to encase it.

It'll likely be sore with you, so you'll need to 'kill' it while it's contained in the magneto sphere. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}
*11650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
This line of research we have going with the electromentals is exciting!  Just think of it... intelligent electrical creatures that we can create at will and that will follow our every instruction!

What could possibly go wrong?

==Completion==
Excellent!  With all of this power that you've recovered we'll be able to keep the machinery running for a little while, anyway.

The [[Zephyrium Capacitorium]] is a real pig when it comes to power consumption!

I hope dealing with those electromentals wasn't too difficult.  I have something else in mind for you to do, and I have a feeling that it's going to be a little more dangerous.

==Notes==
As the "collected Electromentals" are not actual objects, everyone on the quest (and in range) gets credit when one is captured.
