==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will receive:

==Completion==
You have done much for the [[Protectorate]] and the Consortium, <name>.  It is only fitting, then, that the first of our new keys goes to you.  With this key you will be able to open [[Shaffar]]'s personal stasis chamber at any time without having expended the key itself.

<Ameer nods.>

It is permanent and will be with you forever.
