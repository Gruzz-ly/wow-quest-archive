==Objectives==
You have received an invitation to speak again with [[Baron Sablemane]] on some matter of import. Go to him at the [[Circle of Blood]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].

==Description==
<Name>, while you were out being one hell of a <class>;, [[Baron Sablemane]] sent his pet dragon up here with a message.

He's asked for you personally. From what I understand, he wants you to head up his own fight against the gronn.

I guess you're the most qualified person in all of Outland to help him, but if I were you, I'd get in contact with a couple of friends first and ask them to join you at the [[Circle of Blood]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||69|}} at level 70)

==Completion==
Ah, I see that you decided to take your sweet time answering my summons.

No matter, I have plenty of time to exact my revenge, and I intend for you to be my proxy in the coming battle! 

==Progression==
{{Favor of the Gronn}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
