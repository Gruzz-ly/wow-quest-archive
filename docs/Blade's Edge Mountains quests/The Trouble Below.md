==Objectives==
[[Chu'a'lor]] has asked you to speak with [[Mog'dorg the Wizened]] atop one of the towers just outside the [[Circle of Blood]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].

==Description==
We commend your zeal in wanting to help out here in [[Ogri'la]], <class>. However, we have a favor to ask of you before we can accept your assistance.

Down below our brethren are enslaved to the Sons of [[Gruul]]. Please, speak with Mog'dorg the Wizened, who is leading an [[ogre]] resistance against their [[gronn]] masters.

Seek him out atop the tower on the eastern side of the Circle of Blood arena.

==Completion==
You were sent from on high?  Truly my mission is blessed!  I am trying to save the [[Bloodmaul]] from annihilation by the [[Bladespire clan]], and Gruul's sons, who are backing them.

I trust that you will be the one to aid our secret society and deliver us into freedom.
