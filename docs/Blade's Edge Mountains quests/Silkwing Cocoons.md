==Objectives==
[[Taerek]] at [[Mok'Nathal Village]] wants you to collect 8 [[Silkwing Cocoon]]s from [[Silkwing Larva]].

Kill the Larva quickly or they will turn into [[Silkwing]]s, ruining their cocoons.
*[[Silkwing Cocoon]] (8)

==Description==
The silk from the cocoons of the silkwings are used for all manner of things in the village. We can never get enough, and we never have enough.

It is difficult to harvest the cocoons from the larva once they begin the process of metamorphosis.

Our warriors are occupied with the assault on our village. If you could gather these for us, that would be helpful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at max level)

==Progress==
A swift and sure hand is needed for the harvesting. I hope you will be successful.

==Completion==
Good quality cocoons, these. I can see you've gotten the hang of harvesting them.

We have experimented with trying to raise our own silkwing larva, but unfortunately the small ones do not produce enough silk to be of use to us.
