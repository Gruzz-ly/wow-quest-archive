This quest has you killing One of [[Gruul]]'s sons, [[Slaag]], and returning [[Slaag's Standard]] to [[Mog'dorg the Wizened]].

==Objectives==
Retrieve Slaag's Standard and deliver it to Mog'dorg the Wizened atop the tower at the [[Circle of Blood]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Slaag's Standard]]

==Description==
Are you familiar with [[Shattrath City]], <class>? Above it to the northwest is a place called the [[Barrier Hills]], which you can only get to upon a flying mount.

One of Gruul's sons, Slaag, exiled himself and took control of the [[Gordunni]] ogres that reside there. Even at such a distance, we cannot afford to leave him in peace, lest he return when the rest of his brothers have been slain.

<name>, you must travel there, and bring back his standard as proof that he has been dealt with.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|10|70|}}
* 150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you return with Slaag's standard in hand?

==Completion==
What a relief that Slaag is gone. No longer will we be threatened by the looming specter of his return!

If you do not mind, I will take the standard as a symbol of hope for all of the [[ogre]]s of the mountains.

==Achievements==
Although this quest starts and finishes in [[Blade's Edge Mountains]], it does not count towards [[On the Blade's Edge]].

==Progression==
{{Bomb Them Again!}}
