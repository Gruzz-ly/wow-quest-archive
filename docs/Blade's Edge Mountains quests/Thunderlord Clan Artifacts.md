The '''Thunderlord Clan Artifacts''' are whats left of a proud orc clan that were corrupted into fel orcs.

==Objectives==
Retrieve the Thunderlord Clan Drum, Thunderlord Clan Arrow and the Thunderlord Clan Tablet. Return them, along with the Thunderlord Clan Artifact, to [[Rokgah Bloodgrip]] at [[Thunderlord Stronghold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Thunderlord Clan Drum]]
*[[Thunderlord Clan Arrow]]
*[[Thunderlord Clan Tablet]]
*[[Thunderlord Clan Artifact]] (provided)

==Description==
The artifact bears markings that indicate its origins as being created by the [[Thunderlord clan]] [[orc]]s. These orcs used to live at Thunderlord Stronghold before they were changed into [[fel orc]]s.

For a time the [[Bladespire clan|Bladespire]] [[ogre]]s inhabited the stronghold until recently when the [[Horde]] pushed them out.

You've heard of other artifacts that were lost. A drum, an arrow and a tablet come to mind as objects that you know are being sought after.

Find them in [[Bladespire Hold]] and return them to Rokgar Bloodgrip.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50}}

==Progress==
Do I know you?

==Completion==
I do not believe my eyes!  If this is some sort of trick, I will flay the flesh from your bones, <class>!

Quickly, let me examine these priceless artifacts before you break them with your clumsy hands.

==Notes==
*The Arrow can be found at the top of a stone ramp which leads to the top of the stone structure with the dragon carcass within which  4-5 ogres tned to gather around. The Ogre Glumdor can be followed to find this ramp, as he walks up it himself during his patrol route. (location 41.5,52.7).
*The Drum is in a small building on the southern side of the Hold (location 40.2,58.3).
*The Tablet is in a hut on the north side of the Hold (location 41.2,46.5).
*After you loot each object, it will despawn temporarily. It will return about 30–45 seconds. (Note: These items are not despawning on the current patch.)
*The Drum and Tablet artifacts are guarded by Bladefist champions within their huts.
