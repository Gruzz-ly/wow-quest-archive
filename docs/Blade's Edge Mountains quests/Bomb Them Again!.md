This daily quest has the player destroy [[Fel Cannonball Stack]]s at the Forge Camps of [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].  This daily quest is available after completing a first [[Bombing Run (quest)]], which covers the same task as this quest.

==Objectives==
[[Sky Sergeant Vanderlip]] has tasked you with the bombing of 15 Fel Cannonball Stacks. Return to her at the [[Skyguard Outpost]] atop the Blade's Edge Mountains once you have done so.

==Description==
We're still having problems with those flak cannons, <name>.

Don't get me wrong—I think that you did an outstanding job the last time out—but, that doesn't change the fact that those damned demons seem to be replenishing their ammo supplies faster than we can knock them out. And that means we're having a hell of a time getting our people through there, not to mention the risk those demons pose to Ogri'la.

What do you say? Want to take another shot at it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|99}}
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]]
*+500 reputation with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]
*15 {{loot|common|Apexis Shard|Apexis Shards}}

==Progress==
How goes the bombing run?

==Completion==
Outstanding work, <name>! I'd have you back up in the air and bombing them again, but policy around here is to make sure that our pilots get plenty of R&R. Sorry, I don't make the rules, but I sure as hell enforce them!

See you again tomorrow, Ace!

==Achievement==
This quest is used in the finish the [[Fa-la-la-la-Ogri'la]] Achievement.
