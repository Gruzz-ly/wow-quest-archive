== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Timeon]] at Evergrove, which is in the Ruuan Weald in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. 
==  Description ==
The information you have helped me reveal about the nature of the arakkoa here will be of great interest to another.

We were visited by members of the Cenarion Expedition, who have also become concerned with the arakkoa's intentions here in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].

You should seek him out. His name is [[Timeon]], and you will find him at Evergrove in Ruuan Weald. Follow the road west from here, then north when it forks in Razor Ridge. Finally, follow the road west when it splits in the Bladed Gulch. 
==  Completion ==
Ah, yes, [[Dertrok]]. We spoke briefly about the arakkoa. I must say that our... interests in them vary quite significantly. 
==  Gains ==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*2650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|26|}} at level 70)
==Progression==
# [[Trial and Error]]
