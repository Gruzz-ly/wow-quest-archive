==Objectives==
Rina Moonspring wants you to take her Diminution Powder and apply it to 5 of the Bloodmaul Dire Wolves, which can be found at Bloodmaul Outpost and in Bloodmaul Ravine. After doing so, return to her at [[Sylvanaar]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*Bloodmaul Dire Wolf weakened (5)
*[[Rina's Diminution Powder]] (provided)

==Description==
With their wolf pack reduced, the [[Horde]] is looking for replacements. Unfortunately there's another source nearby.

The Bloodmaul ogres in the ravine below to the east keep a strong pack as their own sentries. I hated sending you to kill the Thunderlord wolves, so why don't we do something different this time?

I've derived a magic powder from the dust that naturally falls off the wings of our fey drakes. Sprinkle it on the Bloodmaul dire wolves to make them undesirable to the [[Horde]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Any luck out there? &nbsp;I know that it's dangerous work to be doing this amongst the Bloodmaul ogres, but if we can avoid the killing of any more animals, I'll be happy.

==Completion==
I'm glad to hear that it worked. &nbsp;The fewer the number of Nature's creatures that have to die, the better.

With all that you've done for us already, I must say that I'm beginning to grow very fond of your company.

Take care, <name>.
