==Objectives==
You have been asked by [[Commander Skyshadow]] to kill any 30 [[Bladespire]] [[Ogre]]s in [[Bladespire Hold]] and the [[Bladespire Grounds]]. Return to him at [[Sylvanaar]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] once you have done so.
*Bladespire Ogres killed (30)

==Description==
To the north of the [[Bloodmaul]] clan lies a threat more grave: Bladespire Hold.

The Bladespire ogres are the strongest clan in the mountains, having the favor of the [[gronn]] known as [[Gruul]] the Dragonkiller, and his seven sons.

Now that we've dealt with winnowing the Bloodmaul, it is time to turn our eye upon their rivals.

From [[Bloodmaul Hold]] head north through the ravine until you come to Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds. Slay as many of the Bladespire ogres therein as you can.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Ogre Vanquisher's Belt
|Agile Mountain Bracers
|Sylvanaar Defender's Pauldrons
|Commander Skyshadow's Gloves}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|50}}
*11300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Bloodmaul or Bladespire, it doesn't matter.  All of the ogre clans fight against each other, vying for the dominance that comes with having the favor of Gruul the Dragonkiller.

Each is still our enemy, regardless of who that favor has fallen to.

==Completion==
Your actions against both the Bloodmaul and the Bladespire ogre clans have gone a long way to securing Sylvanaar's future.  While we do not seek to expand past this patch of land, which we initially found empty, we will also not suffer those that would destroy us.

As you have done us good service, I would reward that service with the appreciation of the Alliance.

==Notes==
Any ogre with "Bladespire" in the name satisfies the requirement, as well as the named leaders in the camp.
