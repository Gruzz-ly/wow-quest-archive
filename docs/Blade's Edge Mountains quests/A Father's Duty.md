==Objectives==
[[Torkus]] has asked you to obtain an Unstable Flask of the Sorcerer for him. Return with it to him at [[Ogri'la]] atop the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Unstable Flask of the Sorcerer]]

==Description==
As to that other magical flask, it can only be obtained from one spot: [[Bash'ir Landing]]. It's an [[ethereal]] base, and they [[Ethereum|aren't too friendly]] with outsiders, so it might be a little dangerous to obtain.

Where's Bash'ir Landing, you ask? Well, if you get on your flying steed and head north by northeast, well past [[Forge Camp: Wrath]], you'll eventually spot it. The Bash'ir [[crystalforge]] itself is at the northeast corner of the landing.

Thank you for doing this, <name>. It'll mean the world to our sons! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]]

==Progress==
That sorcerer's flask is sure to make my boys more intelligent than they already are, and that should help immensely with what they'll need to do once they're in the [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]. 

==Completion==
We can't thank you enough, <name>!

Now with these two flasks, unstable though they may be, we'll be able to send one of our boys north to the [[Skyguard Outpost]].

Here, just wait a moment and we'll call for one of them.

<Torkus's right head shouts out for his boy in a low growl.>
