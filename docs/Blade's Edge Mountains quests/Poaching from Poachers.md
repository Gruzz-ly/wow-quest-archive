'''Poaching from Poachers''' sends the adventurer to steal from thieves.

==Objectives==
[[Samia Inkling]] has asked you to acquire 5 Wyrmcult Nets and return them to her at [[Evergrove]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Wyrmcult Net]] (5)

==Description==
Pardon me, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation with Chawn. I'd like to help.

I'm studying the Blackwing Coven, and helping the druids in their dealings with them.

I am very interested in acquiring a few of their dragon whelps; it would help us to gauge exactly what we're up against by understanding that which they revere.

But first, we're going to need to acquire some nets. I noticed that the wyrmcult poachers out in the Ruuan Weald have an abundance of them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}

==Progress==
How's the procurement of nets coming along?  From what I've seen, those nets that the poachers use should be strong enough for the task at hand.

==Completion==
Oh, those look splendid.  These cultists certainly have an eye for craftsmanship.

Too bad for them that it's misdirected.

And now that we have the nets, would you be willing to help little old me with a thing or two?

==Notes==
*This quest becomes available after you accept the quest [[...and a Time for Action]] from [[Tree Warden Chawn]].
*The nets drop from the [[Wyrmcult]] Poachers in the area. The poachers are linked to a Broodling (dragonwhelp creature). The poachers are hunters so they will attack at range and use nets to immobilize.
