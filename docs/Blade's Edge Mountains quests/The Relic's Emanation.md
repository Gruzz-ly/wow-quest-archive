'''The Relic's Emanation''' is a [[daily quest]] available after you complete [[An Apexis Relic]].

==Objectives==
[[Chu'a'lor]] has asked you to return to him at [[Ogri'la]] atop the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] after you have gained [[Apexis Emanations]] from an [[Apexis Relic]].
*Apexis Emanations attained

==Description==
Now that you have felt the enlightening vibrations of the apexis relics, it is time for you to further your understanding of their workings. We are very eager to benefit from your observations!

As you progress in your ability to attune to the relics, you will gain a higher level of knowledge. This recognition will come in the form of an emanation from the relic.

Return to us when you have attained such an emanation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|9|10}}
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]]
*15 {{Loot|Common|Apexis Shard|Apexis Shards}}

==Progress==
Do you have the emanation from the apexis relic about you?

==Completion==
You continue to amaze us with your acumen as concerns the relics, <name>.  May we suggest that you practice with the relics at least once a day to maintain such a sharp edge to your mental acuity?

==Notes==
The quest requires at least 1 [[Apexis Shard]] to activate a crystal. Apexis Shards are received as rewards from other Ogri'la quests, looted from mobs, and gathered from [[Apexis Shard Formation]]s.

If you complete eight of the tone-sequences correctly, you get a buff that gives you 15% faster ground movement rate in Blade's Edge Mountain plateaus for an hour. If you successfully do enough to finish the quest, you get the same buff for two hours. Continuing after that point does nothing.

Failure to properly complete a sequence will result in you getting shocked for around 3000 damage per misstep, and this can kill: however dying to this does not involve a penalty to your durability.

==Progression==
{{Bomb Them Again!}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 3.1.0|note=As of this patch and probably prior, the money reward is {{cost|3|40}} and 15 Apexis Shard and +350 Reputation}}
*{{Patch 2.2.0|note=the money reward was decreased while the Ogri'la faction reward was increased. Changed money to {{cost|9|10}} and +350 Rep.}}
*{{Patch 2.1.0|note=Added.}}
