Baron Sablemane has sent you '''Into the Churning Gulch''' to retreive poisonous glands from deadly creatures.

==Objectives==
[[Baron Sablemane]] has told you that in order to make the poison that [[Rexxar]] needs, you must acquire 7 Crust Burster Venom Glands. Return to him at the [[Circle of Blood]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] once you have done so.
*[[Crust Burster Venom Gland]] (7)

==Description==
So, your Rexxar would have me fashion a poison for him? I'll give him what he desires, but there will be a price. Even for friends, there must be a price. Free things destroy friendships.

First, you must venture a short distance to the southwest to the [[Churning Gulch]].

Therein mill some of the most poisonous creatures in all of [[Outland]], or anywhere. I speak of the crust bursters, and this poison will require gathering their glands for me.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|3|70}}
|Bloodboil Poison|q1=5
}}

==Progress==
You have all of the venom glands? If not, begone and waste no more of my time until you do.

==Completion==
Very well, a simple, if mundane task has been completed. Now, hand me the glands and I will do the difficult part.

==Notes==
The venom glands drop from both the [[Young Crust Burster]]s and the [[Greater Crust Burster]]s. The glands have a higher drop rate from the Greaters.

==Progression==
