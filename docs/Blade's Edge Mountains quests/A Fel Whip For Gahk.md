* This quest opens up as soon as [[A Father's Duty]] is completed, although it is offered by a different [[quest giver]].
* The exact cost to summon the "chief" is 35 [[Apexis Shard|Apexis Shards]].
* The specific "chief" that appears is random from among the four possibilities.
* The [[Fel Crystal Prism]]s that summon the target monster are green crystals, floating above a carved stone base and emitting vapor. Four can be found in each of [[Forge Camp Wrath]] {{coords|33|33|Blade's Edge Mountains}} and [[Forge Camp Terror]], on the Ogri'la Plateau in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
** At camp Wrath, one crystal is on the eastern edge of the area, with two [[Legion Flak Cannon]]s on either side and to the North, and a 6-armed [[Wrath Speaker]] female demon in the middle.
