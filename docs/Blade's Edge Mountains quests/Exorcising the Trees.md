==Objectives==
Collect 5 [[Grishnath Orb]]s and 5 [[Dire Pinfeather]]s and then combine them into [[Exorcism Feather]]s. Use these feathers to exorcise and slay 5 [[Koi-Koi Spirit]]s from the [[Raven's Wood Leafbeard]]s. Once you've done this, return to [[Treebole]] in the Raven's Wood of the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. 
*Leafbeard Exorcised (5)

==Description==
The Grishna have caused the leafbeards and [[Raven's Wood Stonebark|stonebarks]] to be inhabited by evil koi-koi spirits.

We must save the trees or soon all of the Raven's Wood will be lost forever!

Combine the magic of a Grishnath orb, found throughout Grishnath, with a dire pinfeather from a dire raven.

Use the resultant exorcism feather to draw out and slay the koi-koi spirit as quickly as possible. The stonebarks are too powerful for this ritual, but if enough leafbeards are saved, they will be freed as well.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Treebole's Hoop|Raven's Wood Exorciser's Band|Leafbeard Ring|Ring of the Stonebark}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|7|80|}}
*14950 [[XP]] (or {{cost|8|97|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
The evil that is inhabiting the trees is beginning to seep into every natural thing in the woods.

You must act quickly, <name>, before all is lost!

==Completion==
The evil is lifting from the Raven's Wood! Can you feel it, &lt;name&gt;?

You have saved us, and all of the surrounding wildlife, from certain destruction, little one!

I keep stashed four magic rings amongst my boughs for such occasions as this, when a hero arises to do some great deed.

You are one such hero! On behalf of all of the Raven's Wood, we give you thanks.
