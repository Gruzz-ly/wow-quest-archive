'''The Thunderspike''' is the final Thunderlord artifact still in the hands of the ogres.

==Objectives==
Collect the Thunderspike.
*[[The Thunderspike]]

==Description==
If the vision that I granted you is true, then you must travel down into the ravine and to the south end of [[Bloodmaul Ravine]]. There you will find the [[Draenethyst Mine]].

Journey to the back of the mine, and retrieve the Thunderspike. Ignore everything else! I have no interest in the crystals of the mine, nor the ogres therein.

As soon as you have the spear return it to me here!

And, <name>, be very careful with it... I would hate to think what would happen to you should you break it.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You may choose one of the following:|Thunderlord Scalpel|Slow Death Dirk|Wand of the Ancestors}}

You will also receive: {{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
The significance of these artifacts eludes you, I am sure.

When we have all five, our right to the ownership of Thunderlord Stronghold will be secured through the appeasement of its dead spirits.

Do you begin to grasp now why this is so important?  Do you understand why I have little patience for niceties?

==Completion==
Now I am impressed!  Do you have any idea how many others died attempting to retrieve all of these relics?

We are fortunate to have you working with us here, <name>.  Even if you are a bit slow.

You must allow me to reward your dedication to our cause.  Choose, but choose wisely.  When you are done, I will hand over the artifacts to appease the ghosts of Thunderlord Stronghold.

==Notes==

*When you get to the back of the mine, you'll see the a spear (Thunderspike) on the ground. When you try to pick it up, an ogre named [[Gor Grimgut]] spawns. You have to defeat him to get the Thunderspike. It should be a relatively easy fight for anyone who made it this far into the cave.
*When you complete the quest, you can now see several Thunderlord orc ghosts next to Rokgah. They lead to the next part of the chain.

:{{text|whisper|Garm Wolfbrother|I have been watching you and [[Rexxar]]. You must aid him to secure the future of the Horde here in these mountains. Only when you have forced the ogres into submission and slain their master, [[Gruul the Dragonkiller]], will your people be safe.}}
