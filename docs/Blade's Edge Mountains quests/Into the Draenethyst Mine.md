==Objectives==
Bronwyn Stouthammer has asked you to collect 5 Draenethyst Mine Crystals and then return to her at [[Sylvanaar]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Draenethyst Mine Crystal]] (5)

==Description==
Well it's good to see someone who's willing to help out around here!

[[Borgrim Stouthammer|Borgrim]] and I are part of the [[Explorers' League]], and we're here to learn what we can of these mountains. We've heard all sorts of tales, and I can't wait to get settled in and started.

One thing in particular has caught my attention. The [[Night elf|night elves]] speak of a place down in the ravine to the east known as the [[Draenethyst Mine]]. It's at the south end of [[Bloodmaul Outpost]]. I'd like some of the [[draenethyst|crystals]] that grow naturally therein.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Spelunker's Mantle|Miner's Gloves|All-Weather Armguards|Explorer's Boots}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Isn't this exciting? &nbsp;After all of the dirt and insects of [[Silithus]], this place is like a paradise.

==Completion==
Ooh, by the looks of those, they're fine specimens. &nbsp;I can't wait to get my examination tools unpacked and have a real look at them!

Thank you!
