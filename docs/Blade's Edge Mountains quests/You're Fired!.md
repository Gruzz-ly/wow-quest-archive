The overseer did nothing to stop your imaginary revolt, so she too must die!

This quest is part of the {{questchain|Burning Legion of Blade's Edge}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
Kill [[Doomcryer]] and report back to [[Wildlord Antelarion]] at [[Ruuan Weald]].
*[[Doomcryer]] slain
*Suggested Players [2]

==Description==
[[Doomcryer]] did nothing to stop the revolt? How dare she! She has been trying to undermine my authority for sometime. However, this time will be her last. You must summon her and deal with her personally.

Her [[Anger Guard|anger guards]] hold the [[Camp Anger Key|keys]] that summon her to [[Forge Camp: Anger]]. Retrieve the five keys and activate the five Legion obelisks. The obelisk have a short duration, so make sure there are all activated at the same time. Remember, the anger guards carry more keys.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Ruuan Weald Wristguards|Evergrove Ranger's Cloak|Expedition Pendant|Wildlord's Band}}
*You will also receive:
*{{cost|7|80}}
*12000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Are you looking to join my list of those expendable? Get those keys and silence Doomcryer!

==Completion==
That is great news, great news indeed <name>. I could not have asked for a better outcome. Your service to our people is most greatly appreciated, choose one of the following heroic items.

Your name will forever be remembered in our peoples heart.

==Notes==
Pretty standard "tank and spank" Boss.  Solo Kiteable.

To summon her, as the quest says, kill Anger Guards until you have enough keys, and use the keys on
the obelisks. The drop rate on the keys is 100%. 

If doing this solo, clear an area near the teleporter to the right (as you face the ramp up to the camp), then activate the obelisks as quickly as possible and move over to the right. She will walk out and toward the ramp, pull her to the area you cleared. If you lose, you should have enough time to run back from the graveyard at least once for another try.

She has a fairly nasty Curse of Burning Shadows, that does 275 per tick. Hard to remove, as she puts it right back on.

If you are warlock, enslave her and DoT when she has low hp.
