==Objectives==
[[Nickwinkle the Metro-Gnome]] wants you to slay 10 Crystal Flayers and then return to him at [[Toshley's Station]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Crystal Flayer]] slain (10)

==Description==
The damned rock flayers are keeping me from my research down in the [[Singing Ridge]]! By digging at the crystals there, with every scratch they are ruining my chances of studying the harmonics of the singing crystals.

You look like someone who can help me deal with this problem. Head south and clear those crystal flayers out.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70|}}
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at max level)

==Completion==
Good riddance to them; that's what I say. &nbsp;Filthy creatures!

So, if you're certain that you eliminated those pests, then I have a little research project for you. &nbsp;I think you'll like it.
