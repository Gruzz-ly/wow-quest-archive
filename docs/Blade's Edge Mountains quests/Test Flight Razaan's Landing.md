==Objectives==
Speak with [[Rally Zapnabber]] to use the [[Zephyrium Capacitorium]]. Return to [[Tally Zapnabber]] at [[Toshley's Station]].
*Reach the Sky's Limit.

==Description==
<Name>, I raised the efficiency of the Zephyrium Capacitorium by 30 percent. That will launch a test subject of your weight and wind drag ratio to new heights! Want to test my theory? This experiment ought to send you near [[Razaan's Landing]].

Speak with Rally... he'll get you prepared for launch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|40|}}
*5400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|58|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
What?  You don't want to perform the experiment?  Don't fret, <name>!  I'm behind you all the way!

==Completion==
Oh, gosh!  You're back so soon!  I saw you take off and you shot up like a rocket!  I was sure it would take at least a month of convalescing to mend the broken legs from that flight!  You're tough, and brave, and foolhardy!  But mostly... you're brave!
