==Objectives==
Nickwinkle the Metro-Gnome wants you to place the Oscillating Frequency Scanners in such a way that when you stand amongst them, you are hit by five overlapping Oscillation fields.

Return to him at Toshley's Station in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] after you have done so.
*Singing crystal resonant frequency gauged
*[[Oscillating Frequency Scanners]] (provided)

==Description==
Take these scanners to the Singing Ridge. By dropping them in a pattern on the ground, you will create overlapping fields that will read the amplitude of the crystals. Stand amidst them in such a way that you're in five oscillation fields and I'll have the information that I need!

Your scanners will even work with those that others drop.

Oh, and it's likely that a rift will be formed! I have no idea what, if anything, will come out of it, but be prepared for the worst.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Metro's Slimming Legs|Nickwinkle's Harness Experiment|Party Hat Mistake|Last Year's "In" Belt}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|70|}}
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Well, do you have the measurements from the singing crystals that I asked for?

==Completion==
Oh, this is extraordinary! &nbsp;I had no idea... it's almost as if those crystals are alive.

I wonder if there's some sort of symbiotic relationship between them and the nether drakes?

Thank you, thank you! &nbsp;You must accept a little something from my collection of odds and ends that I wouldn't be caught dead wearing.

One of them might look good on you, though.
