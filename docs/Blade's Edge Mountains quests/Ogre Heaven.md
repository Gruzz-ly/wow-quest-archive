==Objectives==
[[Mog'dorg the Wizened]] has asked you to speak with [[Chu'a'lor]] at [[Ogri'la]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].

==Description==
Now that you have delivered us from bondage, we can begin the process of reunifying the clans. This will take some time; old grudges are difficult to overcome.

But more pressing, you must go to Ogri'la in the heavens above to the west. You must defend it, and us, from those forces above that the gronn used to protect us from: [[ethereal]]s, [[demon]]s, and worst of all, the [[black dragonflight]].

When you find ogre heaven, seek out the wisdom of Chu'a'lor on how best to proceed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 690 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]]

==Completion==
Mog'dorg sent a message ahead, saying that I should expect you.  I am glad that you came.

With the Sons of [[Gruul]] destroyed, it is only a matter of time - a short amount at that - before the various inhabitants of this mountain terrace, and the one to the north, decide to prey upon our [[ogre]] brothers down below.

I trust that you will help us to prevent that, <name>.

==Progression==
