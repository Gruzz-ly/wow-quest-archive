==Objectives==
[[Toshley]] wants you to retrieve the Collection of Souls and return it to him at [[Toshley's Station]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Collection of Souls]]

==Description==
<The blood drains out of Toshley's face.>

These orbs are made up of both nether energy and souls, some of them gnome souls!

How dare they!  Were they the ones killing our people that traveled north?!

<Name>, you must put a stop to this, and the only way to do that is to finish off their leader, [[Nexus-Prince Razaan]].

You'll have to coax him out of hiding though.  I'm guessing that you can do that by killing a lot of his Razaani [[ethereal]].

Bring me the collection of souls that he no doubt has.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Gnomish Casting Boots
|Toshley's Station Hero's Hat
|Razaani-Buster Leggings
|Soul Saver's Chest Plate}}
{{itembox|You will also receive: {{cost|7|80}}
|Power Converter}}
*14950 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you dealt with that soul-stealing bastard, Razaan yet?

==Completion==
Good riddance to him!  Thank you for putting an end to their macabre twisting of magic and technology.

As a true hero of gnomes everywhere, I hereby bequeath unto you our highest honor... some power converters and your pick of any of these.

I know that you'll put them to good use!

==Notes==
On completion as Toshly looks on, three Gnome Spirits spawn, thanks the player, then turn into lights which disappear into the sky.
:{{text|say|Gnome Spirit|Thank you, <name>, for saving us from a fate worse than death. You have our eternal gratitude.}}
