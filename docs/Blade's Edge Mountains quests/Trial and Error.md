==Objectives==
Try out each of Dertrok's wands on an [[Dullgrom Dredger|Arakkoa Ogre Slave]], then return to [[Dertrok]]. Each wand will require an [[Infused Vekh'nir Crystal]] to use. 
*Test the [[Dertrok's First Wand|first wand]]
*Test the [[Dertrok's Second Wand|second wand]]
*Test the [[Dertrok's Third Wand|third wand]]
*Test the [[Dertrok's Fourth Wand|fourth wand]]
*[[Dertrok's Wand Case]] (provided)

==Description==
I've fashioned four wands that I believe will enhance the power of the arakkoa's crystals. Take these wands to [[Trogma's Claim]], and try them on the ogre slaves.

You'll need to find an infused crystal off of the [[arakkoa]] in the area.

When you figure out which is best, come back to me. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I eagerly await your results, <name>.

==Completion==
This information will be every helpful, <name>. I will further refine that design and see if we can't expand its utility.
