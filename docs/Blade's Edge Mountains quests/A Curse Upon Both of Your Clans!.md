==Objectives==
Use the Wicked Strong Fetish to curse 5 buildings or towers in Bladespire Hold and 2 in Bloodmaul Outpost. Return to [[T'chali the Witch Doctor]] at Bloodmaul Ravine in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] after you have done so. 
*Bladespire Hold building cursed (5)
*[[Wicked Strong Fetish]] (provided)

==Description==
T'chali wants revenge on all of the ogres!

T'chali was a powerful witch doctor in life. If you reach into me grave you will find a wicked strong fetish.

Invoke the fetish's magic at the entrances to the buildings and towers of both Bladespire Hold and Bloodmaul Outpost. The voodoo you work will summon an evil spirit that you must defeat. This in turn will curse that building.

Beware, if you attempt to curse a building that is already cursed, you will call down another [[Cursed Spirit (Blade's Edge Mountains)|cursed spirit]]!

==Rewards==
{{Itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Witch Doctor's Beads|T'chali's Kilt|Hexxer's Belt|Ogre Defiler's Handguards}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|7||}}
*14150 [[XP]] (or {{cost|8|49|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
T'chali does not want to speak again until <name> has used the fetish to curse the buildings and towers of both the Bladespire and Bloodmaul clans!

==Completion==
Hahaha, revenge is sweet!

But, T'chali can see you be interested in moving on now that you help him get his revenge. &nbsp;I hear you, mon... life is for the living.

Tell you what, T'chali got lots of goodies still left here in his grave. &nbsp;You pick the one you like best!
