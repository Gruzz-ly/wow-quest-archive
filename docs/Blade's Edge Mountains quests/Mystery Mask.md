Someone should know what to do with this mask, now that it's been fixed!

This is part of the {{questchain|Burning Legion of Blade's Edge}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Bring the '''Mystery Mask''' to [[Wildlord Antelarion]] in [[Ruuan Weald]].

==Description==
Ok, it should work now. What is it, you ask? Why, it's a communication device - it allows those blockheads to communicate with each other. You know, the [[Burning Legion]]! I would suggest that you hand this mask to [[Wildlord Antelarion]]. He's over there pacing around. Always moving, he is.

Well get moving, he's been trying to get his hands on one of these for sometime now.

== Completion ==
That mask you hold in your hands is a [[Felsworn Gas Mask]] and by the appearance, it's not damaged. The trouble we can cause [[Forge Camp: Anger]] is boundless. Are you interested in helping us out, <name>?

== Rewards ==
* 3050 [[XP]]
* {{cost|1}}
* +25 [[Cenarion Expedition]] reputation

==Progression==
{{Burning Legion of Blade's Edge}}
