==Objectives==
[[Dizzy Dina]] wants you to kill 10 Ridgespine Stalkers. After you have done so, return to her at [[Toshley's Station]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. 
*[[Ridgespine Stalker]] slain (10)

==Description==
We hired on to help [[Toshley]] when he decided to move to [[Outland]], and we've been on the move ever since.

Now it looks like we've finally put down some roots. All of the crazy scientists have their projects going, and us [[Razak's Roughriders|Roughriders]] are here to protect them.

What we need right now is for you to go north into [[Razor Ridge]], or east to the Scalewing Shelf, and keep them clear by killing the stalkers. They're stealthy spiders that live amongst the rock outcroppings, and jump unsuspecting passersbyers.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards
|Distilled Stalker Sight
|Stealth of the Stalker
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|70|}}
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Those stalkers cleared out yet? We've had a few of our people who headed north disappear.

If it's because of the stalkers, I want to make sure that it doesn't happen again.

==Completion==
Pretty good for a rookie.  As it turns out, we've got a small group of eggheads that want to go 'observe' the [[ethereal]]s and their technology up north.  They'll be thrilled to know that you cleared the way for them.

Here, take some of these.  We don't have many, but maybe they'll help you out in the future.
