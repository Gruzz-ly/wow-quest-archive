==Objectives==
Deliver the Meeting Note to [[Watcher Moonshade]] at the entrance of the Wyrmskull Tunnel in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Meeting Note]] (provided)

==Description==
Hmm, I'm not certain what we should do. I'm not much of a military planner.

Watcher Moonshade will know what to do. He's heading up our defensive efforts at the Wyrmskull Tunnel to the west at the end of Wyrmskull Bridge. We have a force out there just in case the cultists try anything funny.

Please, take the note to him with all due haste.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||69|}} at max level)
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
How can I help you? &nbsp;You bring news from Evergrove?

==Completion==
It's as I thought, and that's not good!

I've got an idea for how to help you, but first, I was wondering if you might help us out first?

You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
