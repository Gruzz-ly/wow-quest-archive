'''The Mark of the Nexus-King''' is a quest which is completed by finding a [[Mark of the Nexus-King]] from one of the [[Ethereum Stasis Chamber]]s in [[Bash'ir Landing]]. Once completed it opens up the [[Stasis Chambers of the Mana-Tombs]] which eventually leads to summoning the optional boss [[Yor]] in [[Mana-Tombs]].

The drop rate of Marks from the Stasis Chambers is not guaranteed, so it may take many attempts to progress this questline.

==Objectives==
The Image of [[Commander Ameer]] at [[Bash'ir Landing]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] wants you to bring him a Mark of the Nexus-King.
*[[Mark of the Nexus-King]]

==Description==
What I must now know is what the [[Ethereum]] have held inside the [[Mana-Tombs]] of [[Auchindoun]].

In your battles against the beasts of the stasis chambers of [[Bash'ir]] you may run across an item known as the Mark of the Nexus-King. Should you find such an item, return it to me immediately! It is the final piece in crafting a key that will allow access to the stasis chamber inside the [[Mana-Tombs]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|g=4|s=40}}
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Consortium]]

==Progress==
This will be your most daunting task, <name>.

==Completion==
At last!

<Commander Ameer reads from the Mark of the Nexus-King.>

Two final prisons? I shudder to think what horrors lie in wait...
