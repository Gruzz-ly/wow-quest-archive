==Objectives==
Visit [[Mog'dorg the Wizened]] atop the tower where [[Chort]] is standing, just outside the [[Circle of Blood]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].

==Description==
Mog'dorg the Wizened waits for you at top of da tower. He tells me to look for a <race> <class> just like you. You go speak with him about smart things.

Go now, but don't tell no one. It's a secret!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||44|}}
*3150-3780 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Finally, Chort has sent me someone who looks like they might be able to help. I am trying to save the [[Bloodmaul]] from annihilation by the [[Bladespire clan]], and [[Gruul]]'s sons, who are backing them.

I trust that you will be the one to aid our secret society and deliver us into freedom.
