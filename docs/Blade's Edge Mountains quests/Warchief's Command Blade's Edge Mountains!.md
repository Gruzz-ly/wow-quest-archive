==Objectives==
Travel to [[Thunderlord Stronghold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] and speak with [[Gor'drek]].

==Description==
The [[Warchief]] is calling for champions to put an end to the [[ogre]] threat in Blade's Edge Mountains. Make your way north into the mountains, to the orcish stronghold of Thunderlord Stronghold and let Gor'drek know of our plight. Any help he can spare would be most welcome.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||74|}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Shadow Hunter Denjai|Denjai]] seeks help?  I'd send him reinforcements, but we're spread thin here as it is.  We've got trouble of our own with the ogres up here.

When I can, I'll give him what information we have on the local ogre [[tribe]]s and their tactics.  Perhaps if he can survive long enough, we'll be able to launch a two-pronged assault on the vile scum.

==Notes==
*Originally ended with [[Nekthar]].
