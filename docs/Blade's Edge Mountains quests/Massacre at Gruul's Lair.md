==Objectives==
[[Baron Sablemane]] has tasked you and your friends with the deaths of 10 Bladespire Enforcers, 5 Bladespire Battlemages, 5 Bladespire Ravagers and their leader, Fingrom. When you have managed this feat, return to him at the [[Circle of Blood]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Bladespire Enforcer]] slain (10)
*[[Bladespire Battlemage]] slain (5)
*[[Bladespire Ravager]] slain (5)
*[[Fingrom]] slain

==Description==
You've proven yourself resourceful, and now I think I'm going to put you to personal use in my own fight against [[Gruul]] and his sons.

The [[Bladespire clan]] are the favored of the [[gronn]], and while you may have thinned out their numbers elsewhere, you haven't yet dealt with their strongest.

Gruul protects the exterior of his lair with only the toughest of [[ogre]]s, and it is those that you must kill. Head north through the [[Daggermaw Canyon]] and you will find [[Gruul's Lair]] at the end.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*14600 [[XP]] (or {{cost|8|76}} at max level)
*{{cost|7|40}}

==Progress==
Have you managed yet to decimate the Bladespire ogres at Gruul's Lair?

Do not come to me with excuses, <boy/girl>! Get the job done!

==Completion==
Very well, I chose wisely when I selected you to spearhead my fight. Time to ramp things up to a whole new level, I think.

You remember that [[Grulloc's Sack|little goodie]] that you [[Goodnight, Gronn|stole for me]] out from underneath [[Grulloc]]'s nose? You're going to get a chance to put it to good use.
