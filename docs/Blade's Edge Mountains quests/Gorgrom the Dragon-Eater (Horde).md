'''Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater''' sends the player to kill one of the son's of Gruul!

==Objectives==
Go to [[Boulder'mok]] and collect 3 [[Grisly Totem]]s from the Boulder'mok ogres. Use Sablemane's Trap at [[Gorgrom's Altar]] to set the trap and summon and kill [[Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater]].

When Gorgrom is dead, place the 3 Grisly Totems near his corpse, then return to [[Rexxar]] at [[Thunderlord Stronghold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*Plant Grisly Totem (3)
*[[Sablemane's Trap]] (provided)

==Description==
The gronn we seek is Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater. With Sablemane's trap, you will make short work of the gronn. You will find him accepting sacrifices from the ogres of Boulder'mok.

Follow the road north from the Circle of Blood, then west at Ruuan Weald. Go northwest through the tunnel.

First, kill the ogres for their heads. We will send a message. Set the trap at his altar. When he is dead, plant the grisly totems near him - none can mistake that message.

Take the bear.

<Misha growls.>

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fanged Axe
|Whistling Sword
|Adjudicator's Staff
}}

==Progress==
The Bloodmaul ogres will trouble us no longer when this task is done.

==Completion==
The ogres of Bloodmaul and their master, Gorgrom, will trouble the Mok'Nathal no longer.

However, I worry about the effect our actions will have on the other gronn. I believe we must end this fight once and for all.

==Notes==
*Boulder'Mok is in the northwest corner of Blade's Edge Mountains.
*Kill any of the ogres nearby to get the Grisly Totems. Once you have 3, use the trap near the altar in the center of the village. Rexxar's bear, Misha, will appear. Gorgrom will appear and approach the altar, but then will die in an explosion. You don't have to attack him. Once he is dead, just plant the totems to complete the quest.
*If an Alliance player is around when you set the trap, Misha might aggro on them.
*Sometimes this quest takes a long time to reset, even after Gorgrom's corpse has despawned. If you can't summon Gorgrom with the trap, you might just try planting the totems to see if you get credit.
