==Objectives==
[[Tree Warden Chawn]] has asked you to seek out and speak with [[Treebole]], an [[ancient of lore]] who lives in the [[Raven's Wood]] of the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].

==Description==
This is troubling! The [[arakkoa]] are causing the [[ancient]]s and [[Ancient protector|protectors]] to become possessed by evil spirits!

But, there is one ancient that could not possibly have been affected. His name is Treebole, and you must go to him at once if we're to save the trees of the Raven's Wood!

Go back to the Raven's Wood. You will find him at the fork in the path just past [[Grishnath]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1200 [[XP]] (or {{cost||72|}} at level 70)

==Completion==
Greetings, tiny <race>. The birds in my boughs whispered to me that you were to be expected.

You are here to help free the trees of the woods from their possession?
