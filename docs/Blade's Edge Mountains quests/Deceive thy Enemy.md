The peasants are revolting!  (It is SO hard to hire good help, these days.)

Don't you just love it when you're ordered to do the thing you most dearly want to do?

This quest is part of the {{questchain|Burning Legion of Blade's Edge}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Kill 4 Doomforge Attendant's and 4 Doomforge Engineer's.
*[[Doomforge Attendant]] slain (4)
*[[Doomforge Engineer]] slain (4)

== Description ==
For every moment I hear silence, you draw closer to your death! SPEAK!

What? The camp has revolted? This cannot possibly be true! My minions would not dare undermine my authority.

Well then, every last one of them will pay for this treachery, they will pay dearly. Silence them all and be done with it! Report back to me once you have carried out my order or you shall be dealt with.

== Progress ==
My patience is tiring, why have you not finished them?

== Completion ==
That will surely teach those that don't do as I say...

By the way... where is [[Doomcryer]]? Why have you reported this revolt to me and not she?

== Rewards ==
* 9000 [[XP]]
* +150 [[Cenarion Expedition]] reputation

==Progression==
{{Burning Legion of Blade's Edge}}
