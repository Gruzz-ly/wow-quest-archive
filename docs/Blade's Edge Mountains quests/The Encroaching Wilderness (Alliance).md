==Objectives==
[[Rina Moonspring]] wishes you to slay 12 Grovestalker Lynxes with all due haste and then return to her at [[Sylvanaar]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. 
*[[Grovestalker Lynx]] slain (12)

==Description==
We've been growing the [[Living Grove]] at an accelerated rate, but somehow the [[lynx]]es there have become lost to our control.

Where once their population was stable, the grovestalker lynxes are now beginning to encroach upon Sylvanaar, and there have been a number of unpleasant incidents of late.

I suspect that the [[arakkoa]] of [[Veil Lashh]] are somehow behind it, but the immediate issue is with the lynxes themselves.

I would be most grateful if you would help us to deal with this situation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Did I not speak the truth? The grovestalker lynxes have become a menace not only to those who would travel the path here, but also to Sylvanaar itself.

Their deaths are regrettable, but the whole point of our creation of the Living Grove is so that Sylvanaar can be surrounded by a defensive region of natural beauty and tranquility.

==Completion==
That was fast.  Are you sure that you dealt with as many as was necessary?

Excellent, there's something else that you can help us with if you are willing?
