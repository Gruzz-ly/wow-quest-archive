==Objectives==
[[Sentinel Moonwhisper]] at the tunnel between [[Zangarmarsh]] and [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] wants you to kill 6 Cavern Crawlers and report to [[Commander Skyshadow]] in [[Sylvanaar]].
*[[Cavern Crawler]] slain (6)

==Description==
Commander Skyshadow wants this tunnel cleared out so we can expedite trade with the [[Orebor Harborage|Harborage]]. I must not leave my post here so I am leaving the task in your hands. Clear the tunnel and report to Commander Skyshadow at once!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|30|}}
*11000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|60|}} at max level)

==Progress==
I swore I told Sentinel Moonwhisper to give direct orders. Are you not obeying them?

==Completion==
Good work, <class>. That tunnel is our lifeline to the swamp.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
