==Objectives==
[[Matron Varah]] has given you a list of ingredients for the making of her two favorite dishes, which includes the collection of 3 Raptor Ribs and 3 Serpent Flesh. Bring them to her at [[Mok'Nathal Village]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Raptor Ribs]] (3)
*[[Serpent Flesh]] (3)

==Description==
Hungry, <race>? The Great Spirit helps those that help themselves. If you want to earn a meal, I suggest that you listen up, because [[Braagor]] there isn't going to give you anything for free, nor as tasty!

The raptors and scalewings of [[Razor Ridge]] and the [[Scalewing Shelf]] have everything that's needed for two of the most delicious dishes you'll ever taste. Bring me their raptor ribs and serpent flesh, and I'll make some of each for you.

I may even teach you how to cook them up for yourself, if you hurry.

==Rewards==

*{{cost|3|70|}}
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have all of the ingredients yet? &nbsp;Talking about it with you has made my mouth water!

==Completion==
Mmm, I can taste them already. &nbsp;Quickly, hand over those parts... I'm going to get them diced up and onto the fire!

Luckily for you, this stuff keeps, and I mean for a long time! &nbsp;So, take these, and I suppose you can have the recipes as well for being so kind as to restock my larder.
