'''Whispers on the Wind''' sends the adventurer in search of the [[Mok'Nathal]] Clan, the home clan of [[Rexxar]].

==Objectives==
Search out [[Leoroxx]] at the [[Mok'Nathal Village]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].

==Description==
I have chased rumors of the Mok'Nathal across Outland with nothing to show for it. Finally, we may have found their home.

But now that the moment is here, I am filled with unease. Unease that has kept me awake deep into the nights during my search. Will they accept me?

I... know their leader's name: Leoroxx. Seek him out. You must be my eyes in this.

==Completion==
What brings you to our village?

==Notes==
Mok'Nathal Village is on the edge of Blade's Edge Mountains, straight east from Thunderlord Stronghold.

==Progression==
