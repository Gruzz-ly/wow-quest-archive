The enemy has the best toys?  Take them away from him, then, and turn them to our own use!

This quest is part of the {{questchain|Burning Legion of Blade's Edge}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
The [[Evergrove Druid]] has asked you to collect 5 [[Fel Cannonball]]s. Once you have done so, use the [[Druid Signal]] to call to the Evergrove Druid inside of [[Death's Door]] at the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].

==Description==
We must shut down the [[Burning Legion]]'s access to [[Death's Door]], but first you're going to destroy their two warp-gates!

The problem is, we can't even scratch one of those things, so you're going to need to use their own weapons against them.

The [[Death's Might|death's might]], [[Death's Watch|death's watch]], [[Deathforge Over-Smith|deathforge over-smiths]] and [[Deathforge Technician|deathforge technicians]] carry the ammunition for the fel cannons.

Normally it wouldn't affect any of them, but if you bring the cannonballs to me, I will imbue them with Nature's unbridled wrath!

== Rewards ==
You will receive:
* 12000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]
* {{cost|3|90}}

== Progress ==
Do you have the cannonballs yet?

== Completion ==
Those things stink more than I thought they would!

Quickly, hand them over to me and I will imbue them with Nature's force such that they will prove extremely deadly to their fel masters and their unnatural creations.

== Notes ==
You might have learned about destroying the Forge Camp equipment during
some [[Nagrand Forge Camp quest chain|missions]] in [[Nagrand]].

==Progression==
