==Objectives==
Deliver the Meeting Note to [[Tree Warden Chawn]] at [[Evergrove]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Meeting Note (starter)]] (provided)

==Description==
The cultist dropped this note, which apparently was to be delivered to [[Overseer Nuaar]]. It is signed by someone named Kolphis Darkscale.

It is likely that Tree Warden Chawn will be interested in looking at this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1150 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
What's that you have there?  Is that a blood stain on that note?

==Completion==
This is interesting, but disturbing. I wonder if [[Samia Inkling|Samia]] knows who this [[Kolphis Darkscale]] is?

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 2.0.3|note=Added.}}
