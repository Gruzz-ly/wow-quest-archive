==Objectives==
Speak with [[Rally Zapnabber]] and use the [[Zephyrium Capacitorium]]. Return to [[Tally Zapnabber]] at [[Toshley's Station]].
*Test Tally's Experiment

==Description==
I built an amazing device, the Zephyrium Capacitorium, and I'm sure it'll work perfectly, but... do you want to help me test it?

There's plenty of hazard pay!

Speak with my twin over there, Rally. Good luck, <name>. Come back after your experiment. Or... if that's not possible due to sustained injuries, your next of kin can report to collect your pay. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||80|}}
*2650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|26|}} at level 70)
*+25 [[reputation]] with [[Gnomeregan (faction)|Gnomeregan]]

==Progress==
Don't be afraid!  This is for science, and science is painful!

== Completion ==
Wow, you made it! &nbsp;And not a single bruise or compound fracture! &nbsp;See, I told you everything would work out!

Here's your pay, &lt;name&gt;, though I factored in medical expenses and you don't need those... so that's a bonus for you!
