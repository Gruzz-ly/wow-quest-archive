==Description==
T'chali used to be a pretty friendly [[troll]]. Me come down here to teach the Bloodmaul how to brew their beer. But once me do that, the Bloodmaul bury T'chali and leave him here to rot!

The worst part of it was that they stole me hookah!

And while you're in there, pick up some brews, too!

==Completion==
Yes, that is what T'chali is talking about! &nbsp;Though me not sure what those ogres put in there; that not T'chali's brand of tobacco that me smell in the hookah.

No matter, T'chali is happy. &nbsp;Happy enough, in fact, to ask you to do something else.
