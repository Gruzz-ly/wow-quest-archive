'''Whispers of the Raven God''' is about finding out the prophecies of the [[Anzu|raven god]] that the [[arakkoa]] are following.

==Objectives==
Kill Grishna arakkoa to gain [[Understanding Ravenspeech]] for 2 minutes. While under the effects of the spell, you can find and receive the prophecy from the four shrines. Return when you have visited all four.
*Receive [[the First Prophecy]]
*Receive [[the Second Prophecy]]
*Receive [[the Third Prophecy]]
*Receive [[the Fourth Prophecy]]

==Description==
At Grishnath, totems left by the [[Oracles of the Raven]] enable the [[arakkoa]] to hear the [[Word of the Raven]]. Unfortunately, the language of the arakkoa is indecipherable to us.

Using the Harbinger's pendant, we can understand it. You will be able to take the souls of the arakkoa to understand their language. While you are suffused with the arakkoa's spirit, you can visit the totems and understand their message.

Discover this for us, <name>.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be allowed to choose one of the following:|Wraithcloth Bindings|Supple Leather Boots|Diluvian Spaulders|Whiteknuckle Gauntlets}}

You will also receive:
*12000 [[XP]]
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
What is this <name>? What do they believe he will do? Where do they believe he will lead them?

==Completion==
This is truly disturbing. The arakkoa were peaceful for a long time. This cult of the Raven was nothing more than a gathering of misfits and madmen.

But their power has grown, that we cannot discount. Perhaps there is more to this Raven than we know.

==Notes==
* Go through the Wyrmskull tunnel to get to Grishnath
* You will receive the buff by killing Ravenclaws or Harbingers
* If you are a ranged fighter, especially one with a pet that tanks, you want to make sure to be close to the Ravenclaws/Harbingers when they die

The actual text of the prophecies (all prefaced with "The Voice of the Raven God whispers:"):

# From the darkest night shall rise again the raven, shall take flight in the shadows, shall reveal the nature of its kind.  Prepare yourself for its coming, for the faithful shall be elevated to take flight with the raven, the rest be forgotten to walk upon the ground, clipped wings and shame.
# Steel your minds and guard your thoughts.  The dark wings will cloud and consume the minds of the weak, a flock of thralls whose feet may never leave the ground.
# The Old blood will flow once again with the coming of the raven, the return of the darkness in the skies.  Scarlet night, and the rise of the old.
# The raven was struck down once for flying too high, unready.  The eons have prepared the Dark Watcher for its ascent, to draw the dark cloak across the horizon.

==Progression==
# [[Creating the Pendant]]
