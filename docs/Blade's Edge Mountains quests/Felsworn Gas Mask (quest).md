Item 1 on the Evil Overlord checklist:  your minions should have transparent masks, if they have masks at all.  Someone in the Burning Legion hasn't gone through the checklist.

This is part of the {{questchain|Burning Legion of Blade's Edge}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
Wear the [[Felsworn Gas Mask]] and use the [[Legion Communicator]]
at [[Forge Camp: Anger]].

==Description==
I have a very special mission for you, <name>. I need you to infiltrate Forge Camp: Anger east of here. When you enter the camp you will need to wear the Felsworn gas mask and locate the Legion communicator. Once you have located the communication device speak with whomever is on the other side of the device.

If all works out you can trick the demon into something devious! Try telling the demon that camp anger has revolted.

Good luck to you <class>.

== Completion ==
What's the meaning of this! No one summons me! Speak, or I will silence you forever!

== Rewards ==
* 12000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[Cenarion Expedition]] reputation

== Notes ==
# The mask only lasts for 1 hour.  If you lose it (for any reason), go back to [[Wildlord Antelarion]] and ask for a replacment.
# You must don the mask while within the [[Forge Camp: Anger]] area to get the necessary buff.
