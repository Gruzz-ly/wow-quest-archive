==Objectives==
In order to prove yourself to the [[Mok'Nathal]], [[Leoroxx]] has ordered you to slay [[Gnosh Brognat]], leader of the ogres at the [[Bladespire Outpost]]. Return to [[Leoroxx]] at [[Mok'Nathal Village]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] after you have done so, or do not return at all.
*[[Gnosh Brognat]] slain

==Description==
Since time forgotten we have fought with the [[Bladespire]] ogres.

We have managed to push them back so that now they only hold a tenuous grip at Bladespire Outpost. It's back the way that you came, on the southwestern edge of the [[Razor Ridge]].

Prove your worth to me by killing their leader, Gnosh Brognat.

Let us see what stuff you are made of when fighting the ogres. 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|90}}
*12000 [[XP]] (or {{cost||72}} at max level)

==Completion==
<Leoroxx appraises you with a keen eye, seemingly trying to take your measure.>

The death of Gnosh Brognat is a boon to all of the Mok'Nathal.  This is a good thing for you.

Let us see if we can push the boundaries of your prowess just a bit more.
