==Objectives==
Gor'drek wants you to gather 4 Dusts of the Fey Drake. After doing so, return to him at [[Thunderlord Stronghold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Dust of the Fey Drake]] (4)

==Description==
The [[Alliance]] has recently moved in to the west, using their elven magics to grow a town and grove in a short matter of time. We must keep their defenses weak so that they do not also grow a spine.

I have a plan that will do that and more. I want you to traverse the bridge to the southwest, which crosses over Bloodmaul Ravine and leads into the Living Grove.

Attack their fey drake defenses in the Living Grove and bring back the magical dust that sometimes can be found upon their wings.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at max level)

==Progress==
It would seem that the [[Alliance]] is determined to follow us wherever we go. &nbsp;Let us teach them that we are not intimidated by their presence.

Do you have that which I have requested?

==Completion==
Not only have you weakened their defenses, but we're going to put this dust to use in bolstering our own defenses against the [[Alliance]].
