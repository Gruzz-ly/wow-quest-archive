'''Wrangle More Aether Rays!''' is the [[daily quest]] version of its predecessor [[Wrangle Some Aether Rays!]], tasking Skyguard agents with restoring their stable of the flying beasts via the wild specimens found around the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] plateaus.

==Objectives==
[[Skyguard Khatie]] has asked you to wrangle 5 Aether Rays. After you have done so, return them to her at the [[Skyguard Outpost]] atop the Blade's Edge Mountains.
*[[Aether Ray]]s wrangled (5)
*[[Wrangling Rope]] (provided)

==Description==
So, I hope that you're up to helping us wrangle up even more aether rays! From what I can see, you're a natural with the rope! And it's for a good cause, because not only do we get fresh mounts, but it helps us to protect [[Ogri'la]], which the ogres appreciate.

Remember, the aether rays fly around [[Vortex Pinnacle (subzone)|Vortex Pinnacle]], and the [[Crystal Spine]] to the northeast.

Think you can wrangle me up some more?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|99}}
*+350 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]
*+350 reputation with [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]]
*15 {{Loot|Common|Apexis Shard|Apexis Shards}}

==Progress==
You're doing great work for us, <name>.  I want you to know that we really appreciate everything that you're doing to keep us stocked up in fresh mounts!

==Completion==
You continue to amaze me!  Tell you what... why don't you come back tomorrow and we'll let the rope cool off for now?

<Khatie laughs.>

Thank you so much, <name>!

==Notes==
The quest dialog has progression of flirtatious remarks as your Skyguard rep increases.  At {{rep|Honored}} she suggests that we meet up after work.  At {{rep|Revered}} she inquires why the aforementioned rendezvous did not take place.

This quest is essentially identical to its non-daily predecessor, [[Wrangle Some Aether Rays!]]:

Aether rays are passive beast-type creatures found atop the western and northern plateaus of Blade's Edge Mountains: [[Vortex Pinnacle (subzone)|Vortex Pinnacle]], [[Bash'ir Landing]], and [[Crystal Spine]]. Plenty can be found quite close to the Skyguard base, assuming little competition from other players. They can be floating slightly above the ground or flying high in the air; the latter must be pulled down with a ranged attack. When wrangled with the provided rope, the rays will follow the character around, but they can be returned to Skyguard Khatie at any time while working on this quest. This can be useful to prevent the wrangled rays from impeding vision, especially for melee classes maneuvering in close quarters.

Capturing a ray originally required damaging it to 30% health or below, at which point it would emote {{text|emote|"The Aether Ray appears ready to be wrangled."}} However, nothing prevents it from dying if over-damaged; it could be killed even after starting the channel on the [[Wrangling Rope]]. It therefore became easier and easier for characters leveled through subsequent expansions to accidentally kill them. To reduce this risk, high-level adventurers may wish to remove some of their gear or use low-powered abilities like Auto Attack and Auto Shoot. At an extreme, they may intentionally die (such as from [[fall damage]] off a mount at altitude) and obtain [[Resurrection Sickness]] to reduce their stats and damage output further.

At some point the threshold was changed to 40%, mitigating this issue very slightly. (As of {{expac|Mists of Pandaria Classic}} it is still 30%.) Some time later, likely early in {{expac|Warlords of Draenor}}<ref name="NoDamagePatch" />, the damage requirement was removed entirely, eliminating the problem.

==Progression==
{{Bomb Them Again!}}

==Patch changes==
* ''Unconfirmed patch (est. {{wod-inline}} [[Patch 6.1.0]])<ref name="NoDamagePatch">Wowhead user comment dated during 6.1.0: https://www.wowhead.com/quest=11066/wrangle-more-aether-rays#comments:id=2124642</ref>'': Aether Rays no longer require being damaged before they can be captured.
*{{Patch 2.1.0|note=Added.}}
