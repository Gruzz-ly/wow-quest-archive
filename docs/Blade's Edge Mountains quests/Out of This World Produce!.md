==Objectives==
Bring the Preserved Fruit to [[Rocket-Chief Fuselage]] at [[Area 52]] in the [[Netherstorm]].
*[[Preserved Fruit]] (provided)

==Description==
I'll be the first to admit I'm not quite sure what this order is for, but Rocket-Chief Fuselage's instructions were very specific -- only the very best fruit, preserved to survive a long voyage and sealed against the elements.

There were other specifications, zero-gravity this and low pressure that. I don't pretend to understand it, but the price is right, so he'll get his superfood. Bring this crate to him up at Area 52. After crossing into Netherstorm, keep following the road until you see the town.

==Rewards==
*1,040 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Is that the delivery from Old Orok?

==Completion==
<The chief inspects the crate's contents.>

Everything looks good here. That's one more thing to cross off the list. Now all we need to do is get the rocket off the ground!
