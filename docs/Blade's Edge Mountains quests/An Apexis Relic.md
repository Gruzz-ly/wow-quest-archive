See the caution about [[Apexis Relic]]s in the Notes section.

==Objectives==
[[Chu'a'lor]] has asked you to return to him at [[Ogri'la]] atop the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] after you have gained Apexis Vibrations from an [[Apexis Relic]].
*Apexis Vibrations attained

==Description==
Long ago a now-extinct sect of the [[arakkoa]] known as the [[Apexis]] lived here. Remnants of their civilization are still present. We call them apexis relics.

What we know about them is that, when properly used, they grant a boon. Each relic presents a colored sequence which, when the crystals are pressed in the correct order, leads through a series of levels, each harder than the last.

An apexis shard is needed to power the relic. Return when you have attained the insight of the apexis vibration.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|4|40}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]]
*+250 reputation with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]

==Progress==
Have you learned how to use the apexis relic yet? Both we and the [[Sha'tari Skyguard]] just to the north are interested in what you learn about them.

==Completion==
<Chu'a'lor nods his heads at you in satisfaction at your accomplishment.>

You have a quick mind, <name>.  It took us much longer to successfully make use of the relic.

Now that you know how, you can do so as much as you care to.  Just remember that they require an apexis shard to power them.

==Notes==
The [[Apexis Relic]] operates much like the Simon [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)] Game.

'''A word of caution:''' You may not want to attempt this under laggy conditions.
If you are hit with lag while the relic is displaying the pattern for you to replicate,
multiple button indicators will go off at once, making it impossible for you to distinguish the proper order.

You will receive the [[Apexis Vibrations]] buff (gives +15% movement speed only on Blade's Edge plateaus, lasts 1 hour)  for completing the crystal game up to 6 buttons.   You may need to complete it for 10 buttons hereafter, though, to again get the buff.  (see the [[Apexis Relic]] page)
