==Objectives==
Retrieve Vindicator Vuuleen's Blade and Vindicator Vuuleen's Shield. Then return them to [[Vindicator Vuuleen]] at [[Bladespire Hold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Vindicator Vuuleen's Blade]]
*[[Vindicator Vuuleen's Shield]]

==Description==
I know it's strange, but I do want to stay in this cage. It gives me the perfect opportunity to do what I came here for; to gather information on the [[Bladespire]].

I can leave at any time, but I would like to have my sword and shield back.

Two of their leaders have my trappings. [[Droggam]] has my sword and [[Mugdorg]] has my shield.

If you have need, obtain and use the [[Bloodmaul Brutebane Keg|brew]] from [[Bloodmaul Outpost]] to the south to thin out their help and entice those two, but beware their sober guards who don't drink!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50}}
*11300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
<Class>, do you have my sword and shield?

While I could leave at any time, it would be embarrassing for me to return to [[Sylvanaar]] without my trappings.

==Completion==
And now I owe you a great debt, for you have helped me to restore my honor. But our work here is not yet over.
