==Objectives==
Collect 18 Plucked Lashh'an Feathers, then read the [[Lashh'an Tome]] in the treetops of [[Veil Lashh]].
*[[Plucked Lashh'an Feather]] (18)

==Description==
The [[magic]] practiced by the Lashh'an [[arakkoa]] is unnatural. They rip out handfuls-clawfuls?-of their own feathers as reagents!

That doesn't sound like good magic to me. I've come here to learn more about their spells. Unfortunately getting close is too much for me.

You could succeed: cast one of their spells on yourself, then return to me. You'll have to find one of their spellbooks, high up in the trees of Veil Lashh.

And unless you've grown feathers I can't see, you'll need to get some of those.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at max level)

==Progress==
From the crude pictographs on the pages of the aged tome, you discern that a large number of Lashh'an feathers will be needed when casting the spells contained within. 

==Completion==
Flipping through the pages of the scratched notes and spindly script of the Lashh'an arakkoa, you find a page with a pictogram of the [[Circle of Power|circles of power]] you have seen in Veil Lashh.
