==Objectives==
[[Razak Ironsides]] has asked you to gather up 5 Extra Sharp Daggermaw Teeth. Return them to him at [[Toshley's Station]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. 
*[[Extra Sharp Daggermaw Tooth]] (5)

==Description==
It's nice that you've been helping out [[Toshley]] and his scientists. I, however, do not have the luxury of indulging in my 'personal' interests.

If you want to make a difference around here, you'll do what I ask of you, and right now, I need weapons.

Our guns are effective at range, but when the bugs get in close, we need to have powerful melee weapons as a backup.

The teeth of the daggermaw lashtails in the northern part of the [[Razor Ridge]] make for great vibro-weapon blades. Scare me up some.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Vibro Shanker
|Vibro Dagger
|Vibro Sword
|Vibro Knuckles
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|5|35|}}
* 2,750 [[XP]]

==Progress==
How's that collection of teeth coming along?

I'm sure that you're going to do a fine job of getting them for us.  While you're doing that, we'll just hold down the outpost here.

==Completion==
Good work, kid.  All of the pain is worth it if even one of my soldiers' lives is saved by your efforts.

I think you should benefit from your sweat and tears, too.  Since we're going to have a new batch of weapons soon, why don't you take one of mine? 

==Notes==
This quest is not available until [[Picking Up Some Power Converters]] has been completed.
