'''Stasis Chambers of Bash'ir''' involves using a key provided to open [[Stasis Chamber Alpha]]. This will spawn [[Thuk the Defiant]] who is a level 70 Elite. The quest states it is a 5-man, but it is very possible to do 3-man. Thuk offers no significant loot other than the quest item.

The reward, [[Protectorate Treasure Cache]], contains an uncommon (green-quality) or better item. Any rare items contained within it are Bind on Pickup.

==Objectives==
Use the Ethereum Key Tablet - Alpha to open [[Stasis Chamber Alpha]] at [[Bash'ir's Landing]] in [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].

Return Evidence from Alpha to the [[Image of Commander Ameer]] at [[Bash'ir's Landing]].
* [[Evidence from Alpha]]
* [[Ethereum Key Tablet - Alpha]] (provided)

==Description==
The [[Ethereum]] have a settlement on the northernmost shelf of [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] known as [[Bash'ir's Landing]]. According to the key tablet, much larger versions of the prisons are kept at Bash'ir's. It should also be noted that the Ethereum refer to those prisons as stasis chambers.

The key tablet grants access to a very specific stasis chamber at the landing known as [[Stasis Chamber Alpha]]. Take the key and investigate.

My image will be awaiting your return at Bash'ir's Landing. Speak to me there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Protectorate Treasure Cache]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Consortium]]

==Progress==
You made it! Any luck?

==Completion==
<The image of Commander Ameer rummages through the evidence.>

It is worse than I thought... These chambers hold ferocious beasts and creatures from many, many different worlds. They hope to one day command the beasts to do their bidding. We must destroy them all!
