==Objectives==
Borgrim Stouthammer wants you to procure 11 Bloodmaul Brutebane Brew for him. Once you've done that, return it to him at [[Sylvanaar]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. 
*[[Bloodmaul Brutebane Brew]] (11)

==Description==
If I'm going to start this vacation out right, then I'm going to need more brew. Unfortunately, the elves know nothing of the fine art of fermentation.

I overheard that the Bloodmaul ogres down in the ravine have plenty. I'm willing to give it a try.

Do me a favor? Head south through the Living Grove and then down the ramp to the east into Bloodmaul Outpost and procure me some? I hear they have big barrels of it laying around and that their brewmasters carry it around to all the other ogres.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
It's getting pretty dry around here.  How am I supposed to enjoy my vacation without something to drink?

==Completion==
What is that smell?  Oh no, don't tell me that's the ogre brew?!

I'm almost afraid to try this stuff out.  Oh well, what the hell?  Bottoms up!

==Notes==
*{{text|say|ACK! That's the worst thing I've ever tasted! I wouldn't let my ram drink that!}}
