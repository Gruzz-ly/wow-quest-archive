==Objectives==
Tor'chunk Twoclaws has asked you to slay 10 Bloodmaul Maulers and 5 Bloodmaul Warlocks. Afterward, return to him at [[Thunderlord Stronghold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Bloodmaul Mauler]] slain (10)
*[[Bloodmaul Warlock]] slain (5)

==Description==
<Tor'chunk leans in close to whisper.>

<Name>, you've done us more than proud in the fight against the ogres so far. And while I have every confidence in what Rexxar has planned, I would still ask that you crush the ogres at Bloodmaul Camp before returning.

That way we'll be doubly certain of the outcome.

To get there, head north down the ramp out of Thunderlord. Then, at the base of the ramp, head west across Dragons' End and north through the Churning Gulch and Daggermaw Canyon.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Darktread Boots|Twin Moon Shoulderguards|Chaintwine Cinch|Fairweather's Wristguards}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|70|}}
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have you destroyed the Bloodmaul Camp yet?

==Completion==
<Tor'chunk nods his head in obvious approval of your killing prowess.>

You continue to impress me, <name>. &nbsp;Every time one of those stinking ogres is felled, we come one step closer to ridding ourselves of an unworthy foe.
