So what's the reward for a job well done, eh?  Yup.

This quest is part of the {{questchain|Burning Legion of Blade's Edge}} quest chain.

== Objectives ==
[[Wildlord Antelarion]] has implored you to travel to [[Death's Door]]. Once you arrive there, use the Druid Signal to call down an [[Evergrove Druid]] so that you can speak with them.

==Description==
Now there is an even greater threat from the [[Burning Legion]]. To the south is a portal known as [[Death's Door]], which opens upon the horrific world where the Legion breeds its deadly hounds.

To get there, exit Evergrove by heading east up the ramp. Follow the path south, through the [[Bladed Gulch]], [[Razaan's Landing]], [[Razor Ridge]] and the [[Scalewing Shelf]]. Then, take the ramp down into the [[Vekhaar Stand]] and enter [[Death's Door]] through the tunnel, south of [[Mok'Nathal]].

Once there, use this druid signal.

== Completion ==
It is a relief that Wildlord Antelarion has sent you to us. The problem
is much worse than first we feared!

== Rewards ==
* 12000 [[XP]]
* +250 [[Cenarion Expedition]] reputation
* {{cost|3|90}}

== Notes ==
The signal gun will summon an [[Evergrove Druid]] when you are within Death's Door.  If lost, [[Wildlord Antelarion]] will give you a replacement.

==Progression==
