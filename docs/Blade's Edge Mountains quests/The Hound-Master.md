Enough with the minions, already.  Time to get the guy keeping the portal functioning.

This quest is part of the {{questchain|Burning Legion of Blade's Edge}} quest chain.

==Objectives==
The [[Evergrove Druid]] has has told you that the final thing you must do is to slay [[Baelmon the Hound-Master]]. Afterward, return to [[Evergrove]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]], and inform [[Wildlord Antelarion]] of your success.
*[[Baelmon the Hound-Master]] slain
*[[Druid Signal]]
*[[Evergrove Wand]] (provided)

==Description==
Baelmon the Hound-Master must die! He maintains the ritual that keeps the portal functioning.

The [[Death's Door]] portal is located at the north end of the canyon. When you find it, you will find Baelmon.

You're going to need help on this one, so take this wand. When you battle the Hound-Master, use it and a couple of my friends will come to your aid.

After you have defeated Baelmon, return to Wildlord Antelarion.

And, <name>, thank you for all that you've gone through for us here.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|Your choice of|Natasha's Arcane Filament|Natasha's Battle Chain|Natasha's Choker||Natasha's Ember Necklace|Natasha's Guardian Cord|Natasha's Pack Collar}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost|11|70}}
*17500 [[XP]]
*+500 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
It is over then?  Has the danger at Death's Door been averted?

==Completion==
You are truly an amazing <race>! If I thought that we were indebted to you before, then now there is simply no way in which we could ever repay you.

But we'll give it a try. Thank you, hero of Evergrove!

==Notes==
You have an Evergrove wand, which summons Evergrove Ancients to help with the fight.

'''Caution:''' Do '''not''' destroy the '''Evergrove Wand'''.  It is required to turn the quest in.  You can only get another one if you abandon the quest.  This will allow you to gain another [[Druid Signal]] from [[Wildlord Antelarion]] which will in turn allow you to summon another Evergrove Druid in Death's Door and reobtain the quest.

Discarding this quest also destroys the [[Druid Signal]] object.  Without the Druid Signal, you cannot summon the Evergrove Druid, and thus cannot retake the quest.  You can return to the Wildlord at Evergrove and ask for a new signal, then return to Death's Door, summon the Evergrove Druid, and get the quest back.
