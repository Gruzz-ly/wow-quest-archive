==Objectives==
Mosswood the Ancient wants you to journey to [[Skald]] and plant [[Ironroot Seeds]] in three different mounds of [[Fertile Volcanic Soil]] and then return to him in [[Ruuan Weald]]. 
*Southern Volcanic Soil
*Central Volcanic Soil
*Northern Volcanic Soil
*[[Ironroot Seeds]] (provided)

==Description==
If you follow the road east and up the side of the mountain, then turn north, you will come to my long lost home.

Once there was a wood there. Its name is forgotten. Long ago the Burning Legion summoned scorched imps and other creatures of flame. My home was destroyed and my people fled. Now only I remain. 

I have saved some ironroot seeds that could be planted in fertile volcanic soil. Their magic is strong. Do this for me and I will share with you the treasures of a forgotten age.

==Rewards==

You will also receive:
{{cost|3|70|}}
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at level 70)
*250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Is it done?  Did you return some life to my ancient home?

==Completion==
You destroyed many of those foul little creatures.  I can rest easier knowing that so many were destroyed.
