==Objectives==
Deliver the Dragonfire Trap to [[Commander Haephus Stonewall]] at [[Evergrove]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Dragonfire Trap]] (provided)

==Description==
There's nothing more that I hate in this world than the sons of [[Gruul]] and their father! They slaughtered my people, and my children, and now I will have a taste of revenge!

I have fashioned a trap from some dragon fire, and if you're clever enough, you might just be able to use it to kill a gronn.

I'm sure that you have a particular gronn in mind; it matters not to me which one you kill. Just hurry, take the trap to your Commander Stonewall.

My thirst for revenge must be quenched!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||69|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Did the [[Baron Sablemane|baron]] fashion us a trap? One powerful enough to kill a [[gronn]]?

==Completion==
Hmm, a trap fashioned from the essence of dragon flame? I wonder how Sablemane comes by such rarified substances?

It does not matter. What does matter is that we are going to use it to slay a son of Gruul!

==Notes==
*This is Admiral Ackbar's line from Episode VI of Star Wars, when they realize that the Death Star's shields are still up.

==Progression==
{{Favor of the Gronn}}
