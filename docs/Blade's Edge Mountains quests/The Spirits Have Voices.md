'''The Spirits Have Voices''' shows that you have appeased the ghosts of the Thunderlord Clan by returning their artifacts.

==Objectives==
[[Garm Wolfbrother]] has told you where the [[Mok'Nathal]], [[Rexxar]]'s people, live. Speak of this to [[Rexxar]] at [[Thunderlord Stronghold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].

==Description==
<name>, now that you can see me, there is something you must tell Rexxar. I know that he seeks his people, and I know where they are.

The Mok'Nathal, as they are known, have a village to the east beyond the Razor Ridge.

Go, give Rexxar this news. His people are in danger, and I know that he will want to come to their aid.

==Completion==
What is this you speak of?

Garm Wolfbrother? He was the last chieftain of the Thunderlord clan. If you have communed with his spirit, then it must be true.

==Notes==
You can only see Garm Wolfbrother when you have completed the quest [[The Thunderspike (quest)]]. He should be right next to [[Rokgah Bloodgrip]].
