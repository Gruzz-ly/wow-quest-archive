==Objectives==
Use Gor'drek's Ointment on 5 of the Thunderlord Dire Wolves to strengthen them and the defense of the Jagged Ridge. Then return to [[Gor'drek]] at [[Thunderlord Stronghold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. 
*[[Thunderlord Dire Wolf]] strengthened (5)
*[[Gor'drek's Ointment]] (provided)

==Description==
With the magical dust you recovered, I have fashioned a magic ointment that will aid in our own defenses.

Our dire wolves are the perfect combination of mount, sentry and friend, but the [[Alliance]] scum have been poaching them in the Jagged Ridge.

&lt;name&gt;, I want you to take this ointment and apply it to our dire wolf friends. The [[Alliance]] will get a rude surprise the next time that they send one of their hunting parties.

Be aware though that some of the wolves may not like this, and will turn on you. 

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Thunderlord Armbands|Dire Wolf Handler Gloves|Gor'drek's Pauldrons|Wolf Chaps}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
How fares the bolstering of our Thunderlord dire wolve's defenses?

==Completion==
Now that you have strengthened the wolves, and the Jagged Ridge's defenses, perhaps we can refocus our attentions on more deadly matters, such as the ogres?

You have done a good job in aiding us here. &nbsp;We could use the help of someone capable, such as yourself, should you decide to stay.

Whatever you do, you have earned my respect and appreciation.
