==Description==
I've been fiddling with the Zephyrium Capicitorium{{sic}} and I'm ready to perform another test! Do you want to help?

This next flight should be short, but fast!

Um... and although I'm sure there's no danger... I have this, uh, waiver that I'd like you to sign. It's just a formality, I assure you!

Best of luck! Talk to Rally to launch yourself, and come back to me after the experiment is over!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|1|60|}}
*5400 [[XP]] (or {{cost|2|58|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
Don't worry, <name>!  Worry never got anyone anywhere!

==Completion==
Wow!  Again, you survived!  I'm a much better [[engineer]] than I give myself credit for!

Here's your pay!  And check back with me later... I'll have more experiments that'll need more test subjects!

==Notes==
To obtain a {{loot|common|Tally's Waiver (Signed)|Tally's Waiver}}, just right click the [[Tally's Waiver (Unsigned)]] in your backpack.
