==Objectives==
[[Torkus]] has asked you to obtain an Unstable Flask of the Beast for him. Return with it to him at [[Ogri'la]] atop the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. 
*[[Unstable Flask of the Beast]]

==Description==
<Class>, we've got a problem—we have lots of sons. And ever since the [[Sha'tari Skyguard|Skyguard]] moved in nearby, all our sons ever talk about is joining their ranks.

As a proud father, we want them to have every advantage for when they apply. So, would you go to the fel [[crystalforge]] at either forge camp to the north or south, and procure a magic flask for our sons? You can't miss their green smoke.

We think that they take ten [[apexis shard]]s to make. We'd give you the shards, but we don't have any at the moment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40|}}
*+250 [[reputation]] with [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]]

==Progress==
You have that magic flask, yet? It will mean the world to little [[Torkus Jr.]]

==Completion==
You're a lifesaver, <name>. Our boys are going to be so excited to hear the news!

OK, so one down and one to go. We did tell you about the other magical flask that they're going to need, didn't we? 

==Notes==
It is likely that the title for this quest stems from a marching song found in many places from the military to the Boy Scouts:
<blockquote><pre>Two old ladies lyin' in bed...
One rolled over to the other and said:

"I wanna be an Airborne Ranger!"
"Live a life of guts and danger!"
"Airborne Ranger!"
"Guts and danger!"

"I wanna be a Mountain Climber!"
"Climb those mountains higher and higher"
"Mountain Climber!"
"Higher and higher!"

"I wanna be a SCUBA Diver!"
"Swimmin' 'round in muddy water!"
"SCUBA Diver!"
"Muddy Water!"

"I wanna be a Combat Medic!"
"Rusty knives and anesthetic!"
"Combat Medic!"
"Anesthetic!"</pre></blockquote>
