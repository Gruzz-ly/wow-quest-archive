==Objectives==
Use Rina's Bough on 5 of the Grove Seedlings to summon forth defenses for the Living Grove. Then return to [[Rina Moonspring]] at [[Sylvanaar]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*Living Grove Defenders summoned (5)
*[[Rina's Bough]] (provided)

==Description==
Though you've done a great deal of good work in defense of our new home here, I still feel that the Living Grove needs more protection.

Please, take this small tree bough that I have imbued with the force of nature. When used upon the seedlings that I have planted out in the grove, it will call down a storm to accelerate the growth of a treant defender.

These treants are critical to the defense of the grove, especially if you choose not to make [[Sylvanaar]] your home for long.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Sylvanaar Gloves|Living Grove Shoulderpads|Protector's Boots|Sentinel Armbands}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|78|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
How fares the bolstering of the Living Grove's defenses?

With the intentions of the arakkoa at Veil Lessh unknown, and the [[Horde]] just on the other side of the ravine, I fear that if we do not move quickly we will find ourselves in a poor situation to protect our new home and our work in the grove.

==Completion==
Now that you have strengthened the grove's defenses, I feel much safer.

You've earned our thanks and appreciation, <name>.

Of course, it just occurred to me that there's something else that we need to take care of!
