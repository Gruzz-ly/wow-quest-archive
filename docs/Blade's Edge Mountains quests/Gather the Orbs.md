'''Gather the Orbs''' sends the adventurer to gather strange pink orbs at [[Razaan's Landing]].

==Objectives==
[[Spiritcaller Dohgar]] has asked you to use the Orb Collecting Totem to collect 15 Razaani Light Orbs. Return to him at [[Mok'Nathal Village]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] after you have done so.
*[[Razaani Light Orb]] collected (15)
*[[Orb Collecting Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
The Razaani ethereals have strange devices that emit small, pink floating light orbs. They remind me of souls.

They are not to be confused with the large yellow balls that break free of the ethereal when they die, these are something else entirely.

I'd like for you to head north to Razaan's Landing and drop some totems, which will attact the pink light orbs.

Bring them back to me so that I might determine exactly what they are.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}
*11650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you collected all of the Razaani Light Orbs that are needed?

==Completion==
Something does not feel right.

Please, <name>, hand me the totem.  I must examine those orbs!

==Notes==
*When you drop a totem, it will attract all the nearby pink orbs. It will only absorb one orb though. The cooldown on the totem is 5 seconds so you can quickly place another one.
*You don't really need to kill anything for this quest. Just hang out at one of the entrances to Razaan's Landing just outside aggro range. Drop totems there and it should pull any nearby orbs to you. Or if you have a flying mount, land on top of the ethereal technology (the gates work very well) and just keep dropping to totem, you'll be done in no time.
*The orbs you collect are not actual items that fit in your inventory. It is assumed that the totem absorbs them and you only need to turn that in.
