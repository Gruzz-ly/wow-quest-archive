'''Assault on Bash'ir Landing''' is a very quick breadcrumb quest for the [[Sha'tari Skyguard]] that introduces players to the [[Bash'ir Landing raid]] event.

==Objectives==
[[Sky Commander Keller]] has asked you to speak with the [[Aether-tech Apprentice]] at the [[Skyguard Outpost]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. 

==Description==
Heya, <boyo/girly>! Up fer some fun are ye?

Every couple o' hours, me [[Bash'ir Landing raid|aether-techs launch an assault]] on [[Bash'ir Landing]], far ta the northeast in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. They say that they're there 'studying' the Bash'ir [[crystalforge]], but it's an assault; there be no two ways about it. We use the crystalforge to resupply, and there's always extra to be sold.

Go on down ta the landin' pad and speak with the aether-tech apprentice. He'll tell ye when the next mission is ta launch.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost||44}}
*1250 [[XP]]
*10 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]

==Completion==
Despite how Keller cares to characterize it, I prefer to think of our missions as research-oriented.

But yes, we do resupply the Skyguard while we're there. That is if we can stay long enough to do so.

You look like you'd be willing to keep the ethereals off of our backs. If you can manage to for long enough, we'll sell you surplus items that we create at the crystalforge, so bring your [[apexis shard]]s and [[Apexis Crystal (item)|crystals]]!

We leave in <1 hour/X minutes>.

''(The time reported is the time before the next event begins, and may be any time from "1 hour" down to "0 minutes". Any time above an hour will be reported as "1 hour". This is identical to what the [[Aether-tech Apprentice]] tells players when spoken to normally.)''

==Notes==
*No part of the [[Bash'ir Landing raid]] event is actually required to complete this quest, and there is no follow-up quest, nor any quest associated with the event. Players may choose whether or not to participate in the event (or a later repetition of it) at their preference.

==Progression==
