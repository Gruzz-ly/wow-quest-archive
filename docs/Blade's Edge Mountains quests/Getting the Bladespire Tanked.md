==Objectives==
Take the Bloodmaul Brutebane Keg and use it in an attempt to get 5 Bladespire Ogres drunk. If you're successful, return to Borgrim at [[Sylvanaar]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*Bladespire Ogres drunk (5)
*[[Bloodmaul Brutebane Keg]] (provided)

==Description==
I'll not take another sip of that ill-smelling muck! But it does give me an idea.

<Borgrim gets a twinkle in his eye.>

So here's the plan. We know that the Bloodmaul practically live off of this swill. But I wonder what their enemies, the Bladespire ogres, think of it?

<Name>, I want you to take the rest of this rubbish and see if you can get the Bladespire ogres tanked. You can find them by heading north from Bloodmaul Outpost through the ravine.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|50|}}
*11300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What's the word? &nbsp;Are the Bladespire ogres as indiscriminate as the Bloodmaul, or did it nearly kill them like it did me?

==Completion==
Ah, hahaha! &nbsp;That's what I thought. &nbsp;I guess ogre's will drink anything.

Stupid, the lot of 'em!

Well, I must say even though I didn't get my brew, you have given me a great start to my vacation.

Tell you what... we have all sorts of stuff here we don't really need. &nbsp;Can I offer you something?
