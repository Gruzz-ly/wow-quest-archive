==Objectives==
[[Vindicator Vuuleen]] has asked you to kill [[Gorr'Dim]], leader of the [[Bladespire Hold]] [[ogre]]s. Once you have done so, return to her at Bladespire Hold in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Gorr'Dim]] slain

==Description==
The leader of Bladespire Hold is known as Gorr'Dim. Trust me... the name is appropriate.

Still, I wouldn't underestimate him. He's crafty enough to have elevated his clan to be the favorite of [[Gruul]] the Dragonkiller and they now dominate these mountains. And Gorr'Dim keeps an entourage about him at all times, including defenders who are sworn not to drink the Bloodmaul brew.

For the safety of [[Sylvanaar]], I'm asking that you go back in there and deal with him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}
*11650 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What was all of that noise? Was that you dealing with Gorr'Dim?

==Completion==
Very well.  You're a very resourceful <class>, that's for certain.

I wonder then if there's one more thing that you can do for myself and Sylvanaar?
