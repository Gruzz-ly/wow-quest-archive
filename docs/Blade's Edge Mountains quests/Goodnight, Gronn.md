==Objectives==
Baron Sablemane wants you to steal Grulloc's Sack, and then return it to him at the [[Circle of Blood]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Grulloc's Sack]]
*[[Sablemane's Sleeping Powder]] (provided)

==Description==
I've outdone myself again. I've fashioned a sleeping powder for you to use on [[Grulloc]], the [[gronn]] I spoke of who is guarding what I want.

Grulloc keeps himself at the [[Cursed Hollow]], an area at the eastern edge of [[Dragons' End]] on the other side of the [[Circle of Blood]].

If I were you, I wouldn't tarry long once you have his sack. The effects of the dust won't last long.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70|}}
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at level 70)

==Progress==
You are before me again, <class>. This must mean that you've procured the sack out from underneath Grulloc's nose.

==Completion==
<Baron Sablemane peers inside the gronn's sack and seems satisfied.>

Very well, you have upheld your end of the bargain. And now, I will gift your [[Haephus Stonewall|Commander Stonewall]] with the trap.

==Notes==
Get just within throwing range, and the second he's asleep, get moving. When he says that it won't last long, he isn't kidding: you've got 10 seconds to grab the sack.

==Progression==
{{Favor of the Gronn}}
