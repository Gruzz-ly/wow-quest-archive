==Objectives==
Kill [[Rema]] and then inform [[Commander Skyshadow]] at [[Sylvanaar]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
* [[Rema]]  slain

==Description==
WANTED!

Rema, the den mother and primary defender of the Jagged Ridge south of [[Thunderlord Stronghold]].

Find her by heading east out of town and across the bridge that traverses the Bloodmaul Ravine. She keeps herself secluded in the tunnel at the southern edge of the ridge.

Return with news of her demise to [[Commander Skyshadow]] of [[Sylvanaar]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:|Heavy Elven Dirk|Wolf Hewer's Axe|Arcane Wand of Sylvanaar}}

You will also receive:
*11300 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What can I do for you today?

==Completion==
Unbelievable. Did you slay [[Rema]] all by yourself?

By the looks of you, I'd say that you could. You know, we're looking for a young, strong &lt;class&gt;, such as yourself, to help out around here, especially with the problems we continually have with the ogres. Make sure that you follow-up with me on that possibility.

Well, you've definitely earned the bounty that I put on that wanted poster.

Please, take your pick.

==Notes==
This quest should be done with [[Marauding Wolves]], as you'll kill a lot of the [[Thunderlord Dire Wolf|Thunderlord Dire Wolves]] while getting to [[Rema]].
