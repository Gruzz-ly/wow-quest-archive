==Objectives==
[[Skyguard Khatie]] has asked you to wrangle 5 Aether Rays. After you have done so, return them to her at the [[Skyguard Outpost]] atop the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. 
*Aether Rays wrangled (5)
*[[Wrangling Rope]] (provided)

==Description==
Wanna help the [[Sha'tari Skyguard|Skyguard]] and [[Ogri'la]]?

Just hear me out before you walk away, <hot stuff/girly>. We're in need of remounts! The bombing runs and missions to [[Bash'ir Landing]] have taken a toll on our mounts.

The aether rays that fly around [[Vortex Pinnacle (subzone)|Vortex Pinnacle]], and the [[Crystal Spine]] to the northeast, look like they'd do just fine. You don't even have to bring them back here, though that would be nice. Just break and rope them, and we'll track them down later.

Think you can wrangle me up some? 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|4|40|}}
*0 [[XP]]
*350 [[reputation]] with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]
*350 [[reputation]] with [[Ogri'la]]

==Progress==
You wrangle me some aether rays yet? You look like you might have some skill with rope, so it shouldn't take you too long. 

==Completion==
Woo hoo! Nice job, <name>! Those rays are going to make excellent mounts!

Stick around kid... the Sha'tari Skyguard can always use a <man/woman> of your obvious talents!
