==Objectives==
[[Commander Haephus Stonewall]] has asked you to kill [[Dorgok]] at [[Bloodmaul Camp]]. Return to him at [[Evergrove]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] after you have done the deed.
*[[Dorgok]] slain

==Description==
Good, I've seen you around and I've been meaning to speak to you about a matter of some importance.

There are reports coming in that for some reason the [[Bloodmaul clan|Bloodmaul]] ogres are planning an offensive against [[Sylvanaar]] and [[Ruuan Weald]]. We don't know who or what is pushing them to do this, but I intend to nip their plan in the bud!

Bloodmaul Camp is where the attacks are to be staged from. Head northwest down the ramp out of the Ruuan Weald and you will find it. I want you to kill their leader, Dorgok!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70|}}
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at max level)

==Progress==
I cannot express strongly enough how important it is that you kill Dorgok as quickly as possible.

==Completion==
With [[Dorgok]] dead, the Bloodmaul [[ogre]]s are without leadership, and should be in disarray until another leader arises from within their ranks.

Thank you, <class>, I think we can breathe a little easier now.
