==Objectives==
To begin your understanding of the [[Mok'Nathal]], slay Vekh, leader of the [[Vekh'nir]] [[arakkoa]]. Then, return to [[Leoroxx]] at [[Mok'Nathal Village]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Vekh]] slain

==Description==
<Leoroxx looks you in the eye with the kind of stare that chills your soul.>

You come to the Mok'Nathal, but you do not understand us. You do not understand our struggle to survive.

If you would understand us, then you will have to endure a taste of that struggle.

To the south are the Vekh'nir arakkoa. They have enslaved a group of ogres in the caverns known as [[Trogma's Claim]] and their leader, Vekh is in there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost||69}} at max level)

==Progress==
We have many enemies.  Some we have chosen, and some, such as the Vehk'nir, we have not.

Regardless, we shall slay all of their chieftains until none stand before us.

==Completion==
The Vekh'nir are the least of our adversaries.

So, you know how to slay an overgrown bird.  This does not make you a true warrior.  This does not give you a full understanding of our ways.

But it's a start.
