Even '''The Smallest Creatures''' can be a powerful force in war.

==Objectives==
Use the Kodohide Drum at the Marmot Den. While controlling the [[Marmot (NPC)|Marmot]], poison the three kegs in the [[Bloodmaul Camp]]. When that is completed, return to [[Rexxar]] at [[Thunderlord Stronghold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].      
*Poison the keg of [[Green Spot Grog Keg|Green Spot Grog]]
*Poison the keg of [[Ripe Moonshine Keg|Ripe Moonshine]]
*Poison the keg of [[Fermented Seed Beer Keg|Fermented Seed Beer]]
*[[Kodohide Drum]] (Provided)

==Description==
The ogres, simple as they are, would notice you dispersing this poison throughout their camp. Thus, I will teach you how to enlist the help of one of nature's smallest creatures to do this task.

By playing a simple rhythm on this drum, you can coax a marmot to follow your commands.

There is a den of marmots near the Bloodmaul camp, to the north, down in the Daggermaw Canyon past the Circle of Blood.

Once you have a marmot's aid, use it to disperse the poison to the Bloodmaul's kegs.

==Progress==
<class>, you are back so soon? Do you have the poison? 

==Completion==
This is unsavory business, this use of poisons. But it will do what we want.

==Notes==
*'''NOTE''': This quest appears to be bugged currently.  Using the drum will some times result in the player becoming stealthed, but no marmot appearing.  Additionally while controlling the marmot, you may not get completion credit for poisoning the fermented seed beer keg.
*'''NOTE''': If you are using a button bar addon, make sure you have your pet bar enabled for this quest.
*'''NOTE''': If you already did [[Into the Soulgrinder]] then you won't have to stealth during the quest.
*The Marmot Den can be found at location {{coords|56|29|Blade's Edge Mountains}}. It's a small mound on the southern end of the Bloodmaul Camp.
*Once you use the drum, you will take control of a marmot. Your body will despawn so you won't have to worry about random people attacking you.
*The marmot has 4 abilities:
**Attack - Shouldn't be used
**Stealth - You might need to activate this since it may not be on when you get control of the marmot. This allows you to sneak through the camp easier. However if you get too close to an ogre, it will see through the stealth and attack.
**Throw Acorn - Similar to the rogue's [[Distract]] ability. You can toss an acorn to cause ogres to face away from you. This helps you to sneak by.
**Poison Keg - When you are near a keg, use this to poison it. If you put your cursor over a keg, you will get the Use "cog" cursor. Right-clicking on the keg will '''not''' poison it.
*The wolves in the camp can see through stealth easily so keep your distance from them.
*Be careful to not get the marmot killed as the drum has a 5 minute cooldown on it.
*If you are detected and your marmot is killed, you will regain control of your body. Whatever killed the marmot will then gain threat from you and will run straight at you.
*The 3 kegs you need to poison are:
**Ripe Moonshine Keg - south end of camp (location {{coords|55|28|Blade's Edge Mountains}})
**Green Spot Grog Keg - center of camp (location {{coords|55|25|Blade's Edge Mountains}})
**Fermented Seed Beer Keg - north end of camp (location {{coords|55|23|Blade's Edge Mountains}})
