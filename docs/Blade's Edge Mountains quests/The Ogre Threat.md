==Objectives==
Travel to [[Thunderlord Stronghold]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] and speak with [[Nekthar]].

==Description==
As if the [[naga]] and their allies weren't enough, the [[ogre]]s are extending their reach in [[Zangarmarsh|the marsh]]. They've already conquered most of the area to the northwest and there isn't much of a buffer left.

For each one we kill, several more take their place. I'm not sure how long we'll be able to hold [[Zabra'jin]] once they decide to attack. Make your way north into the mountains, to the [[orc]]ish stronghold of Thunderlord Stronghold and let Nekthar know of our plight. Any help he can spare would be most welcome.

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*2700 [[XP]] (or {{cost|1|62|}} at level 70)

==Completion==
[[Shadow Hunter Denjai|Denjai]] seeks help?  I'd send him reinforcements, but we're spread thin here as it is.  We've got trouble of our own with the ogres up here.

When I can, I'll give him what information we have on the local ogre [[tribe]]s and their tactics.  Perhaps if he can survive long enough, we'll be able to launch a two-pronged assault on the vile scum.
