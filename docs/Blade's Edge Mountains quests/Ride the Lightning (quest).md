== Objectives ==
[[Toshley]] wants you to use the [[:Repolarized Magneto Sphere]] to absorb 25 lightning strikes from the [[Scalewing Serpent]]s. As well, collect 5 [[Scalewing Lightning Gland]]s. Then, deliver them back to him at [[Toshley's Station]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
* Lightning Strikes Absorbed (25)
* [[Scalewing Lightning Gland]] (5)
* [[Repolarized Magneto Sphere]] (provided)

== Description ==
We haven't kept the use of the [[Zephyrium Capacitorium]] under budget. But, it occurs to me that the serpents of the [[Scalewing Shelf]] to the east have a lightning breath and glands that we can make use of.

I've repolarized the magneto collector to absorb lightning strikes and I want you to head up there, activate it on yourself, and get us some cheap fuel from those serpents. 

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Energized Wristwraps
|Charged Footwear
|Scalewing Gloves
|Muscle Toning Belt}}
{{itembox|You will also receive: {{cost|3|70}}
|q=5|Pure Energy}}
*11650 [[XP]]

== Progress ==
The trick to using the repolarized magneto sphere is to know when to turn it off before you end up getting truly fried.

Of course, you need to balance that against how many of those flying serpents you want to have to face.

Speaking of which, have you managed to charge up the sphere?

== Completion ==
Woo hoo, it worked!  To be honest I wasn't sure... I calculated a twenty-three point seven two chance that you'd implode by the third strike.

<Toshley grins innocently.>

So, now we know that the sphere works, we should have no problem meeting our energy needs for the Zephyrium Capacitorium.  Well, that is if we can find more volunteers to go out there and get zapped.

Still, you've pioneered our efforts and deserve something in return!
