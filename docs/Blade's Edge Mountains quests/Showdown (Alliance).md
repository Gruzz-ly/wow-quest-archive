==Objectives==
Use Sablemane's Signet at the [[Altar of Goc]], then kill Goc. Return to [[Baron Sablemane]] at the [[Circle of Blood]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] when this is done.
*[[Goc]] slain
*[[Sablemane's Signet]] (provided)

==Description==
[[File:Quest Showdown TCG.jpg|thumb|In the [[TCG]].]]
The time has come for us to face Goc, the master of the [[Bladespire clan|Bladespire]] [[ogre]]s. It is also time that I take a hand in events, to see the last of the [[gronn]]'s life.

Take my signet ring. When you come to the Altar of Goc, use it, and I will come to join you.

Together we will destroy Goc.

==Rewards==

{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Clefthoof Hide Leggings|Oilcloth Breeches|Tourmaline Crown|Malefactor's Eyepatch|Blackened Chestplate|Leonine Breastplate}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|13|20|}}
*19000 [[XP]] (or {{cost|11|40|}} at max level)

==Progress==
In time, all the sons of Gruul will be destroyed. 

==Completion==
You fought surprisingly well for a <race>, and it was an honor to have you at my side. My transformation must have been quite a surprise for you.  I trust it was not too startling?

Let us keep my true identity between the two of us for now, shall we? In return, and for your adept service, I grant you your choice of any of these baubles. 

==Notes==
If you let him, Baron Sablemane will conveniently tank Goc for you. You can't let him do ''all'' the work, though, you must take care that you do sufficient damage, otherwise you won't get credit for the kill. How much damage is sufficient is not entirely clear, but I found this quest to be easily solo'able by simply doing continuous DPS in a manner so as to stay close below the Baron's threat. Use a threat meter such as [[Omen (AddOn)|Omen]] to monitor the Baron's (and your) [[TPS]]. If necessary, the fight can simply be repeated by summoning Baron Sablemane again, i.e. you don't have to abandon and re-acquire the quest.
