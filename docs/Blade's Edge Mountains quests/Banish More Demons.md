'''Banish More Demons''' is the repeatable version of [[Banish the Demons]], unlocked as soon as it is completed, which requires {{reputation|Honored}} status with [[Ogri'la]].

This used to be the mechanism to obtain {{item|Darkrune|Darkrunes}} for the [[Shartuul's Transporter (event)|Shartuul's Transporter]] event. Since the event's removal, the quest now serves as simply another [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]] reputation [[daily quest]].

==Objectives==
[[Kronk]] has asked you to use the Banishing Crystal to banish 15 demons at [[Forge Camp: Wrath]] or [[Forge Camp: Terror]] atop the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. Return it to him once you have done so.
* [[Banishing Crystal]] (provided)

==Description==
If we know the demons, and we do because we've studied them extensively, they're fast at work repairing any damage that has been done to [[Shartuul's Transporter|their precious transporter]].

So, if you want a chance at another [[Darkrune|darkrune]], take our banishing crystal back out there and eliminate more demons. Besides, you want to help us to lessen the threat that the demons pose, yes?

We said "chance" because the process we use yields mixed results. You might get a darkrune, or you might get something else entirely.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|99}}
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]]
* [[Kronk's Grab Bag]]
* 15x [[Apexis Shard]]

==Progress==
A seasoned pro such as yourself shouldn't be having any difficulty banishing demons.  You're not having any difficulties, right, <race>?

==Completion==
We wish the process of creating a darkrune was foolproof, <name>. Alas, it is not. Please, take this bag and look in it to see what we've wrought today. We couldn't bear to look ourselves.

Remember, if you get a darkrune, take it to Gahk to exchange for a [[Crystalforged Darkrune|crystalforged darkrune]]. Then you'll be able to once more [[Shartuul's Transporter (event)|bring down Shartuul's transporter]].

Oh, and <name>, don't forget to come by [[daily quest|again tomorrow]] and pickup the banishing crystal. There are always more demons to be banished.

==Notes==
This follows the same mechanics as its non-daily predecessor, [[Banish the Demons]]. Unlike that quest, it did not guarantee a [[Darkrune]], instead awarding [[Kronk's Grab Bag]] which could either contain the rune or just a [[Darkrune Fragment]].

Since [[patch 4.1.0]], the bag only contains an [[Apexis Shard]], as the [[Shartuul's Transporter (event)|associated event]] was removed.

==Progression==
Requires {{rep|Honored}} status with [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]], probably starting with the [[Ogre Heaven]] quest chain. Then:
# [[Banish the Demons]]
#* Unlocks: [[Banish More Demons]]
# {{Strike|[[A Crystalforged Darkrune]]}}
#* Unlocks: {{Strike|[[Yous Have Da Darkrune?]]}}
# {{Strike|[[Shartuul's Transporter (event)|Shartuul's Transporter]]}} (event)

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 4.1.0|note=Reward bag no longer contains [[Darkrune]] or [[Darkrune Fragment]], replaced with [[Apexis Shard]].|comment=Quest text referring to darkrunes was not updated.}}
* {{Patch 2.1.0|note=Added.}}
