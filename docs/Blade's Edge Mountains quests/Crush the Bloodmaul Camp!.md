==Objectives==
Lieutenant Fairweather has tasked you with slaying 10 Bloodmaul Maulers and 5 Bloodmaul Warlocks. Afterward, return to her at Evergrove in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Bloodmaul Mauler]] slain (10)
*[[Bloodmaul Warlock]] slain (5)

==Description==
I've heard that you've done us more than proud in the fight against the ogres thus far. Now, I would ask that you face them again. I want you to crush the ogres at Bloodmaul Camp!

To get down there, head northwest down the ramp out of the Ruuan Weald. You'll find them at the base of the ramp.

Good luck, <class>!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards|Darktread Boots|Twin Moon Shoulderguards|Chaintwine Cinch|Fairweather's Wristguards}}
You will also receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at max level)

==Progress==
Have you destroyed the Bloodmaul Camp yet?

==Completion==
<The lieutenant nods her head in obvious approval of your killing prowess.>

I am impressed, <name>. &nbsp;Your reputation seems to be well-deserved.

Every time one of the ogres is felled, we come one step closer to ridding ourselves of a danger that has no intention of leaving us in peace.
