==Objectives==
[[Baron Sablemane]] has told you to bring him 7 Crust Burster Venom Glands. Return to him at the [[Circle of Blood]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] once you have procured them. 
*[[Crust Burster Venom Gland]] (7)

==Description==
Very well, I'll create this trap, but first I want something in return.

There happens to be a nearby gronn that is in possession of an item that I want, but you can't face him, not yet anyway.

So, you and I are going to fashion a sleeping powder from the poison of the nearby crust bursters.

You'll find them in the [[Churning Gulch]] to the southwest. Bring me a number of their glands, and be quick about it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70|}}
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at max level)
*[[Bloodboil Poison]]

==Progress==
You have all of the venom glands? If not, begone and waste no more of my time until you do!

==Completion==
Very well, a simple, if mundane task has been completed. Now, hand me the glands and I will perform the difficult part.

==Progression==
{{Favor of the Gronn}}

==Patch changes==
