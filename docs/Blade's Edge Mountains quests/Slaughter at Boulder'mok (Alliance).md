==Objectives==
Slaughter 5 [[Boulder'mok Brute]]s and 3 [[Boulder'mok Shaman]], and then return to [[Lieutenant Fairweather]] at [[Evergrove]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].

==Description==
I know that we have plans for you to head to [[Boulder'mok]]. I have something that I want you to do while you are there.

We must take any chance we can get to strike down the ogres of these mountains, or they will overrun us, and all that we have bled and died for will be for nothing!

Boulder'mok lies to the west. Travel southwest, cross the bridge and head through the tunnel. On the west side of the [[Raven's Wood]] you will find them.

<Name>, I want you to wipe out the [[Bladespire]] ogres of Boulder'mok.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|90}}
*12000 ({{Cost|7|20}} at level 70)

==Progress==
I dare say that you are the most capable ogre hunter that I have ever known.

I trust then that you will deal with the Boulder'mok ogres soon?

==Completion==
<Lieutenant Fairweather grins at the story that you tell her about your adventures at Boulder'mok.>

Ah, I wish that I could have been there with you.  Let me tell you something, <name>: never accept any duty that keeps you from the glory of the battlefield!

Hah!  After all of the ogre killing that you've done, are there any still left in these mountains for me?!
