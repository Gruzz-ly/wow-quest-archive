==Objectives==
[[Dizzy Dina]] has asked you to acquire 5 Ether-Energized Flesh and return them to her at [[Toshley's Station]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]]. 
*[[Ether-Energized Flesh]] (5)

==Description==
<Name>, I've got something else for you to do.  One of the eggheads wants to study the fiendling flesh beasts that can be found at [[Razaan's Landing]], north of the [[Razor Ridge]].

More to the point, they want to study the flesh of the [[Fleshbeast|flesh beast]]s that are there.

<Dizzy makes a disgusted face.>

But, of course, they aren't willing to get their hands dirty, and they only want the ether-energized flesh, which it's not likely that all of them have.

I say, beggars can't be choosers, but what can you do? 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|3|70}}
*11650 [[XP]] (or {{cost|6|99|}} at max level)

==Progress==
You have my pound of flesh?  What, you didn't think that was funny? 

==Completion==
These ought to do nicely.  Don't they stink, though?

I hope that this is worth your troubles...  I'm just glad that it was you collecting this stuff instead of me! 

==Trivia==
The name of this quest is a reference to the Shakespearean play, "The Merchant of Venice", in which a creditor demanded a pound of flesh from someone who was unable to pay back his debts.
