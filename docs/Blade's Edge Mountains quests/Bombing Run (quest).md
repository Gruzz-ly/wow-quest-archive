'''Bombing Run''' is one of the final steps in the [[Ogri'la]] quest chain, requiring bombing the nearby [[Burning Legion]] camps from a character's own [[flying mount]] while dodging Flak Cannon fire. This and several quests in the [[Netherwing]] quest chain were some of the first in the game to be designed around such mounts. [[Bomb Them Again!]] is the repeatable [[daily quest|daily]] version of this quest.

==Objectives==
Use the Skyguard bombs to destroy 15 Fel Cannonball Stacks.
* [[Fel Cannonball Stack]]s destroyed (15)
* [[Skyguard Bombs]] (provided)

==Description==
;Regular
You have a flying mount... so what! You think you have what it takes to use it properly?

[[Forge Camp: Wrath]] and [[Forge Camp: Terror]], to the north and south, are a major pain in my backside, as well as being a threat to peaceful [[Ogri'la]]. With all of those fel cannons shooting down the [[Sha'tari Skyguard|Skyguard]] left and right, we can't get through there to take care of business.

You want to prove yourself? Take these bombs and knock out their ammo stacks. Just don't let them shoot you down, too!

;Druid only
You can fly around as a crow... so what!  Ever annihilate something on the ground while you were flying?  Want to?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|11|99}}
* 500 [[reputation]] with [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]]
* 500 reputation with [[Sha'tari Skyguard]]

==Progress==
You take out their stacks of fel cannonballs yet?

==Completion==
Well, well, well, I guess you had it in you after all.  Good work.  Maybe Old Man Keller was wrong about you after all.

<Sky Sergeant Vanderlip smirks.>

==Notes==
A supply of [[Skyguard Bombs]] should be provided automatically, or can be obtained from [[Sha'tari Skyguard]] representative [[Sky Sergeant Vanderlip]]. North or south lie the Forge Camps, with the ammo stack targets marked near enemy Flak Cannons (with a graphic similar to [[Hunter's Mark]]), which fire fel flames into the air on approach, potentially igniting players and knocking them back and/or dismounting them if they do not dodge. The bombs can be deployed while in motion in mid-air and hit a small manually targeted [[Area of Effect|area]] on the ground from fairly close range. They have a short [[cast bar]], but players may continue maneuvering and even fly out of range while "casting" without ruining the attack.

The single most important preparation is to have the bombs easily available before starting the attack run. Using an [[Action Bar]] slot or other hotkey is highly recommended. Once activated, the AoE targeting cursor will appear on the ground below. The targeting process remains active as the player continues flying, so it is possible to position the mouse some distance in front of the attack path to "find the range" and click to fire once it overlaps an ammo stack.

The Fel Cannons will start tracking on anyone approaching the Forge Camps on a flying mount, and after a second or two, start to fire a spray of fel fireballs in their direction.  They loosely lead their targets, so generally, at least one will be close enough to the line of travel that maneuvering around it is required.  Being struck interrupts flight and [[knock back|knocks the player]] in the direction the cannonball was travelling; formerly this dismounted fliers, but knockback effects were updated to pause fliers rather than dismount them in [[Patch 3.3.0]].  The flames also deal a couple thousand points of damage over several seconds.  If dismounted, a slowfall method (parachute cloak, spell, etc.) used before hitting the ground is useful to reduce [[fall damage]].

Typical tactics:
# Approach the cannons somewhat from above to allow more time for dodging.
# Watch and listen for the cannon firing, then jink from side to side to avoid any fireballs.
# Have the bomb ready to release by the time you approach the cannonball stack. 
# Release the bomb (click) the moment the green targetting radius image is over a stack
# Fly upward while the bomb is releasing. This both changes the flight path (to avoid a fireball that would intercept) and increases range from the cannons. This decreases the chance of getting hit, although it does increase the potential fall damage if dismounted.

Note that unmounted players will not be fired upon, but anyone on a flying mount - ''even on the ground'' - will be targeted. This provides an alternative strategy:
# Walk fairly close to the cannonball stack.
# Get on a flying mount.
# Immediately use the bomb on the cannonball stack.
# Dismount, run away, or both. Make sure to dodge where the fireballs land if the cannons have already fired, even after dismounting.

A hybrid strategy may also be used, staying on the ground while remaining on the flying mount to launch the bombs then running clear / around to the next target without dismounting. A brief liftoff can de-aggro ground enemies if necessary, while it is quick to self-heal and fall damage is avoided if hit while already on the ground.

Faster flying does make it significantly easier to dodge cannon fire.

===Helpful macro===
Use of the bombs required for this quest can be made easier by integrating them with a normal ability already on the action bar using a [[macro]]. This allows easy reach of the bombs while flying, especially if placed in an early action bar slot like #1 or #2. The [[macro conditionals|condition]] <code>[flying]</code> ensures it does not interfere with normal ability use. Other similar items could be added - it will only use the ones actually in inventory - possibilities include the [[Arcane Disruptor]] from [[Culling of Stratholme]], and the [[Skyguard Blasting Charges]] from the [[Skettis]] egg-bombing daily.
