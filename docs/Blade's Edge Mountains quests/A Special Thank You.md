'''A Special Thank You''' is a bonus quest for becoming {{reputation|friendly}} with [[Ogri'la]].

==Objectives==
[[Chu'a'lor]] suggested that you speak with [[Jho'nass]] at Ogri'la atop the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].

==Description==
You honor us with your efforts on our behalf. And now there is someone that we would like for you to meet.

Jho'nass is our most trusted quartermaster. He maintains a stock of goods that we provide for sale to only the most dedicated of friends to Ogri'la.

You are one such friend, <name>.

When you find the time, go and speak with him. As we understand it, he has prepared a little something for you as a token of our appreciation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||53|50}}
* 350 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Ogri'la (faction)|Ogri'la]]
*[[Ogri'la Care Package]]

==Completion==
Hey, man, that's great.  We hear you've been doing good things.  That's cool.  We've got a feeling that you're going to make things right for us here in Ogri'la, and keep us safe, and everything nice and mellow.

Here, take this.  It's nothing much, just a care package that we whipped up as a thanks for your effort.

Feel free to look around at our goods.  We have a lot of really choice stuff that you're gonna want to get.
