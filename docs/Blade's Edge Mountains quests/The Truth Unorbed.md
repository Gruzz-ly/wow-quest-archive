==Objectives==
Deliver the Orb of the Grishna to [[Tree Warden Chawn]] at [[Ruuan Weald]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].
*[[Orb of the Grishna]] (provided)

==Description==
This strange, magical orb drops from beneath the contour feathers of the [[arakkoa]].

Suffused with an eerie, purple glow, the orb pulses to an unheard beat. Holding it makes you mildly uncomfortable, and so you quickly place it within your pack.

Perhaps [[Tree Warden Chawn]] at Ruuan Weald to the west, through the tunnel and across the [[Wyrmskull Bridge]], would be interested in examining it?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1200 [[XP]] (or {{cost||7|20|}} at level 80)

==Progress==
<Class>, do you feel that? I sense something unnatural and evil nearby.

==Completion==
Yes, it's that orb you have there! Odd, it appears to be of arakkoan design. Were you recently at [[Grishnath]]?

All right, that explains that, but I wonder what diabolical purpose this object serves. Though it radiates evil, it also somehow feels as if it were connected to the natural world as well.

Here, allow me to try activate it. The evil is so strong within it, there's some sort of residual memory here....

==Notes==
*After turning in the quest, a short scripted event will happen showing the memory contained within the orb:
:''A [[Grishna Arakkoa]] is seen walking up to an [[Unsuspecting Leafbeard]], and then starts channeling a [[totem]] at it.''
:{{text|say|Tree Warden Chawn|Oh no!}}
:''An [[Evil Koi-Koi]] emerges from the totem and slowly walks towards the Unsuspecting Leafbeard, possessing it upon reaching it.''
:{{text|say|Tree Warden Chawn|I can watch no longer. We MUST undo this evil that the arakkoa are perpetrating upon the protectors of [[Raven's Wood]]!}}
:{{text|emote|The Unsuspecting Leafbeard creaks in pain as it is possessed by the koi-koi.}}
:''The memory disappears.''
