==Objectives==
Speak with [[Brunn Flamebeard]] at [[Wildhammer Stronghold]] in [[Shadowmoon Valley]].

==Description==
I've heard that the [[Wildhammer dwarf|Wildhammer dwarves]] maintain a [[gryphon roost]] at their fortress down in southern Shadowmoon Valley. If you're going down there, would you speak to them on my behalf? I have some ideas on how to improve their [[gryphon]]s!

Why stop at armoring them when you could attach an altimeter, a rear view mirror, and rocket? Imagine how fast you could go with one of those babies strapped to your gryphon's back! I'll call it the TurboGryphon 8000!

==Rewards==
Upon completion of this quest you will gain:
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||69|}} at level 70)

==Completion==
<Brunn's face reddens until its color is indistinguishable from his beard.>

He wants to do WHAT to my gryphons?

If that little pipsqueak puts anything other than a saddle on them, I'll personally travel up to [[Blade's Edge]] and stuff that rocket o' his down his throat!
