This quest requires killing one of the black dragons that flies above areas around the [[Ogri'la]] plateau. Make sure to bring 35 [[Apexis Shard]]s to activate the encounter.

==Objectives==
Sky Commander Keller has asked you to acquire Dragon Teeth and return them to him at the Skyguard Outpost atop the Blade's Edge Mountains.
* [[Dragon Teeth]]

==Description==
As ye've flown around, ye must have noticed the dragons above. I trust ye haven't fallen victim ta their rage. Help us put an end ta it, <name>!

Rivendark and Obsidia lord over this terrace, while Insidion and Furywing rule the skies over yon terrace ta the northeast. Each has a perch on their respective domains. I be wondering if ye and yer friends will go ta one, <lad/lass>, break open an egg and attract the dragon down.

Bring me some teeth as proof. Ta rule the skies, it's either them or us.

==Rewards==
The quest it self does not reward any item besides the gold reward.

==Progress==
How fares yer mission, <name>? I needn't tell ye how important this be ta our continued ability ta fly around up here.

==Completion==
Yes! Those teeth look like they be sharp enough ta cut through just about anything!

And let me encourage ye and yer friends ta keep up the good work! Those dragons be fierce predators that make the skies wholly unsafe.

Ye might have noticed, too, the dragon scales. I hear they be good fer making powerful cloaks if ye get one o' each o' their scales. And if yer not happy with the cloak ya get, I'll be willing ta trade ye an apexis crystal fer it.

==Notes==
There are a total of four eggs in dedicated areas around the plateau, each of which will summon the corresponding dragon:

* [[Rivendark's Egg]]
* [[Insidion's Egg]]
* [[Obsidia's Egg]]
* [[Furywing's Egg]]

Penetrating any egg's shell to activate it requires spending 35 {{item|Apexis Shard|Apexis Shards}}. The fight itself is straightforward, with the usual dragon attacks ranging from a Breath of Fire to Tail swipe and an AOE Fear ability similar to [[Onyxia]] and [[Nefarian]], suggesting group members other than the tank should attack from the side. The original dragons were [[elite mob|elite]] with around 190K hit points, but were reduced to an easily-soloed power level in [[Patch 4.3.0]].

Each of the dragons drops a scale that can be looted by all five people in the group. Combining all four dragons' scales together produces a [[Deathwing Brood Cloak]] with a random [[item suffix]].  Any cloak can be returned to [[Sky Commander Keller]] in exchange for an [[Apexis Crystal (item)]].
