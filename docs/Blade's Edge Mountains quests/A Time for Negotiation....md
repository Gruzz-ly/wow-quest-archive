==Objectives==
[[Tree Warden Chawn]] has asked you to negotiate with [[Overseer Nuaar]]. Return to the tree warden at [[Evergrove]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]] afterward.
* Negotiations with Overseer Nuaar complete

==Description==
When we arrived in the [[Ruuan Weald]], the [[Wyrmcult|wyrm cultist]]s were keeping themselves to [[Blackwing Coven]], through the tunnel to the west. But now, they are encroaching upon us here.

I need you to find the wyrmcultists' overseer. He's known to make a regular patrol between their various camps in the Ruuan Weald.

Negotiate with him. Let him know that there's room for compromise, but that we will not condone or allow the wholesale slaughter of the wildlife, nor the felling of all of the trees.

==Rewards==
* 11650 [[XP]]
* {{cost|3|70}}
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Cenarion Expedition]]

==Progress==
Is everything okay?

==Completion==
WHAT?!  They dismissed you and our proposals out of hand?

This is outrageous!  We go to them in good faith, and they turn you away without even trying to come to a compromise?

Well, we'll see about that!

==Notes==
* Tree Warden Chawn (61,39).
* Overseer Nuaar walks north and south up and down the path to the west of Evergrove (58,38 to 61,30).

;Quotes
The Blade's Edge Mountains are a place of great opportunity. How unfortunate that some deem themselves above all others on matters that pertain to talking advantage of such opportunities. 

Who do the [[Cenarion Expedition]] think they are to tell us what we can and cannot do here?

[[File:GossipGossipIcon.png]]''Overseer, I am here to negotiate on behalf of the Cenarion Expedition. 

Negotiations? NEGOTIATIONS!

Allow me to make our stance perfectly clear. We are a free people, able to do whatever we want and come and go as we please. The Cenarion Expedition does not own this mountain range.

There will be no negotiations! Now, go back to the druids and tell them that we will continue to do as we people.
