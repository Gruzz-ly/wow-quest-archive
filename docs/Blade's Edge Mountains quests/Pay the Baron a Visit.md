==Objectives==
Speak with [[Baron Sablemane]] about fashioning a trap. He is located at the [[Circle of Blood]] in the [[Blade's Edge Mountains]].

==Description==
This is bad news. Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater is behind the recent Bloodmaul plans against Sylvanaar!

Why he's manipulating them, and not just using the Bladespire, I don't know. But if we're to deal with a gronn, we're going to need help.

I know a man who is wise in the ways of all sorts of exotic magics. [[Baron Sablemane]] is his name, and you can find him at the [[Circle of Blood]], back down the ramp to the northwest, and then southwest through the canyon.

Ask him to fashion us a trap for the gronn.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*1150 [[XP]] (or {{cost||69|}} at level 70)

==Completion==
Ah, an envoy from the vaunted [[Alliance]]. Tell me, lackey, why is it that you are here, begging me for this thing, instead of your illustrious commander?

Could it be that he is afraid of me? It says something about you that you are not, but I haven't quite decided yet what that is.
