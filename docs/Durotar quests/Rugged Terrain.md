==Objectives==
Find the lost rune by slaying [[scorpid]]s in the [[Valley of Trials]]. Learn the rune's power, then report back to [[Jen'shan|Jen'sahn]]{{sic}}.
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Chimera Shot (hunter rune)]]

==Description==
A [[hunter]] draws strength from their connection to the natural world. On your journey, you will track quarry through all manner of harsh terrain, surviving only by your wits.

Not long ago, another fledgling hunter sadly failed in this. He went out to hunt scorpids, and never returned. He was experimenting with engraving mystical runes onto his equipment to improve his combat prowess.

Find his rune among the scorpids nearby, and return when you have learned its secrets.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]
*[[Cracked Leather Gloves]]

==Progress==
Have you found the rune, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Applying the rune to your equipment will grant you powerful new abilities.

There are many such runes throughout [[Azeroth]]. Seek them out, as they will help along your journey.

==Notes==
Kill [[Scorpid Worker]]s until they drop the [[Rune of the Chimera]].
