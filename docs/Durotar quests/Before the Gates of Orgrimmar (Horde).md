==Objectives==
Begin the battle at the gates of [[Orgrimmar]].
*Speak with [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] to begin the battle

==Description==
It is time. We have done all that we can to prepare. All that remains is the battle itself. I am not one for speeches. So I will say only this. Lok-tar ogar, <name>. Victory. Or death.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
...<!-- That's actual Lor'themar's progress text. -->

==Completion==
Saurfang... slain by dark [[magic]]...

I have known [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] for years, but I have never seen her wield such power. Why reveal it to us now? What does she gain by abandoning the [[Horde]]?

<Lor'themar's eye narrows.>

Whatever she has planned, it would seem that she no longer requires the Horde to achieve it. We will need to be cautious, <name>. There is no telling what her next move will be.

==Notes==
Speak to Saurfang to begin the event:

{{Dialogue|
Today we make our stand.

{{Gossip|I am ready. For the Horde!}}

A brief cutscene plays showing Saurfang, accompanied by [[Thrall]], [[Anduin Wrynn]], and the player character, approaching the gates of Orgrimmar. It then segues into the [[Reckoning]] cinematic:
