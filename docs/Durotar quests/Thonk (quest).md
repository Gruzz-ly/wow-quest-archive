==Objectives==
Report to Thonk on the [[guard tower]] northwest of Razor Hill.

==Description==
''(if male)'' Oh, sweetie, I just remembered! / ''(if female)'' Sorry if I've been mean to you.  Sometimes I get a little jealous when other women come into town, as I'm a little insecure about my appearance.

''(both)'' My VERY good friend Thonk works in the guard tower on that cliff, just to the northwest of Razor Hill.  He said something about a river overflowing, lots of work to be done, and so on.  I wasn't really paying attention... I was staring into those deep brown eyes of his.

''(if male)'' What, we can't see other people? / ''(if female)'' Thanks.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||22}} (or {{cost|||30}} at max level)
* 70 [[XP]]
* +10 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
* +10 reputation with [[Bilgewater Cartel (faction)|Bilgewater Cartel]]

==Completion==
Gail sent you? Did...did she say anything about me?
