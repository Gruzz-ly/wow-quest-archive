==Objectives==
Talk to [[Zenda]] in the [[Brewfest Grounds (Durotar)|Brewfest grounds]].

==Description==
<The [[hozen]] have been successfully chased away, and [[Brewfest]] saved once again.

The question asks itself, though: How did hozen get to [[Durotar]]? Perhaps somebody in the Brewfest grounds has experience with them.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]
*10x [[Brewfest Prize Token]]

==Completion==
<Zenda spits on the hozen totem.>

Do not be fooled by deir appearance. Dese hozen are ruthless. Some chased my brother out of his own bar in Zuldazar and took it over as deir own!

I have seen dese winged ones, and dey are unwelcome wherever dey go.
