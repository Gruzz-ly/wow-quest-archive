==Objectives==
Learn what [[Allari the Souleater]] sees.
* Learn what Allari the Souleater knows
* Kill [[Felblade Assassin|infiltrator]]s (12)

==Description==
Look around. What do you see?

<Allari glares at something over your shoulder.>

The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] has already infiltrated the [[Horde]]... even now, they are among you.

We must protect your Warchief.

When you are ready to see what lies beneath the veil, say the word.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards: 
|Brand of the Banshee Queen
|Accolade of the Banshee Queen
|Token of the Banshee Queen
}}

You will also receive:
*{{cost||20}}
*1,400 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The Illidari were right! Destroy the demons, <name>!

==Completion==
It would seem the demon hunters' concerns were well-founded. To think the demons would dare worm their way into our city during this period of mourning!

This does not bode well for the rest of my kingdom.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|Say the word and I shall reveal the hidden menace!}}

Speak with Allari to continue.

;Allari the Souleater
:Your eyes are deceiving you. Do not trust them!
:{{gossip|Show me the proof.}}

An [[Legion in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|Vo7Tba8Y5s0|urlArgs=start=14&end=30}}
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|Behold, the enemy is among us!}}
:''Allari runs over to an [[Orgrimmar Grunt]], brandishing her glaives.''
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|You cannot hide what you truly are, [[demon]]!}}
:''The Orgrimmar Grunt laughs and removes their disguise, revealing themselves to be a [[Felblade Assassin]].''
:{{text|say|Orgrimmar Grunt|You discovered us too late, Illidari! FELBLADE, ATTACK!}}
:''The camera pans to the right as more Fellblade Assassins are unveiled and a [[Shard of Hate]] crashes into the scene.''
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|More of them are in our midst!}}

On the other side of the cutscene, a phased encounter begins. Kill any 12 demons around the funeral area, then return to Sylvanas to turn in the quest.
