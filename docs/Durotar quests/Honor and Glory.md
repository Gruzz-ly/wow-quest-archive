==Objectives==
Enjoy the feast!
*Enjoy the Feast! (100%)
*Brawl with [[Boss Magor]] and the [[Orc Peon (Heritage of Draenor)|Peons]]

==Description==
You have successfully completed the [[om'gora]]! Congratulations, <name>.

Now it is time for us to celebrate! We have prepared a feast for all in attendance, in your honor!

Go, revel in the glory you have earned. Enjoy yourself. If any of these orcs get out of line, remind them why you were the one who was chosen to complete the new rite first!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
The [[Kosh'harg]] has been a great success, better than I had dared hope. Have you had your fill of the festivities?

==Completion==
Yes, I think it's time we draw this celebration to a close. There is such a thing as partying too hard!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|yell|Thrall|Our champion has completed the om'gora! Let us feast in their honor! Lok-tar!}}

The screen fades to black. Upon fading back in, Razor Hill has entered a new phase: the feast is in full swing and almost all of the named visitors are now crowding around the tables, which are loaded with food. The player has a Guest of Honor debuff, occasionally causing nearby [[Rowdy Grunt]]s and [[Rowdy Warlock|Warlocks]] to turn hostile and challenge them to a brawl.
:{{Abilities|Guest of Honor|id=399316|A feast is being held in your honor! You may attract challengers.|icon=achievement_alliedrace_magharorc}}

Filling up the quest bar is done by defeating brawlers (5%) or by eating the food on the tables, each type of which gives a different 5-minute buff:
*[[Chimearok Chops with Cheese]]: {{Abilities|Chimearok Chops with Cheese|id=399669|Eating the chimaerok chops has increased your stamina!|icon=spell_nature_unyeildingstamina}} (2%)

*[[The Strong Stuff]]: Gets the character very drunk. (5%)
*[[Blackrock Coffee (object)|Blackrock Coffee]]: Sobers the character up.

[[File:Honor and Glory - Magor and Peons.jpg|thumb|Boss Magor and the Peons.]]
In addition, [[Boss Magor]] is standing at the northern end of town with his [[Orc Peon (Heritage of Draenor)|Orc Peons]] and can be challenged to a brawl:
:The Kosh'harg has gone off without a hitch! I think these peons have earned a break!
:What do you say, <name>? Are you ready for the peons to join the party?
:{{Gossip|Bring it on!}}
:{{Text|yell|Boss Magor|Get ready everyone! It's time for the peons to join the party!}}

Magor and the Peons run into the center of town and become hostile. Magor is an elite who occasionally casts "Bootstorm", a whirlwind ability that creates [[Booterang (Honor and Glory)|Booterangs]] that can be tossed at him or any of the other hostile orcs.
:{{Abilities|Booterang|id=400758|Fling a boot at the target, knocking them down and dealing Physical damage.|icon=inv_boots_chain_01}}

Bring Magor to 30% health to end the fight.
:{{Text|yell|Boss Magor|Oof! Good brawl! Just what I expected from our champion!}}

===Dialogue===
On approach, some of the guests have conversations with each other.

;[[Drunk Grunt]] and [[Ariok]]
:{{Text|say|Drunk Grunt|Come on, fight me, big guy!}}
:{{Text|say|Ariok|Can't you see we're trying to have a conversation?}}
:{{Text|say|Drunk Grunt|Yeah, but I don't care! Fight me!}}
:{{Text|say|Ariok|As you wish!}}
:''Ariok knocks the Drunk Grunt over.''
:{{Text|say|Ariok|As I was saying...}}

;[[Jorin Deadeye]], [[Ritssyn Flamescowl]], and [[Tactical Officer Kilrath]]
:{{Text|say|Jorin Deadeye|...So that is why I intend to unify [[Bleeding Hollow clan|our clan]] once more.}}
:{{Text|say|Ritssyn Flamescowl|It is a bold plan, Deadeye.}}
:{{Text|say|Tactical Officer Kilrath|Does that mean you are moving the clan to Azeroth?}}
:{{Text|say|Jorin Deadeye|Aye. It is clear that the future of the orcs is here.}}

;[[Leoroxx]] and [[Rexxar]]
:{{Text|say|Leoroxx|Rexxar. You look... strong. You have kept up with your training.}}
:{{text|say|Rexxar|Yes. You as well.}}
:{{Text|say|Leoroxx|...}}

;[[Nazgrim]] and [[Gorgonna]]
:{{Text|say|Nazgrim|It is good to be among [[Warsong clan|Warsong]] again.}}
:{{Text|say|Nazgrim|I was not sure I would be welcome among the living.}}
:{{Text|say|Gorgonna|Of course, General. As far as I'm concerned, you died with honor, and continue to serve with honor in your undeath.}}
:{{Text|say|Gorgonna|The past is the past. The orcs must move on and keep striving forward, together.}}

;[[Thega Graveblade]] and [[Garona Halforcen]]
:{{Text|say|Thega Graveblade|You should join us, Garona. Officially.}}
:{{Text|say|Thega Graveblade|You can even challenge me for my position if you wish, we just need more orcs of your skill!}}
:{{Text|say|Garona Halforcen|I have become used to doing things alone, and used to not really being welcome among the orcs.}}
:{{Text|say|Thega Graveblade|[[Times Change|Times change]], as they say.}}
:{{Text|say|Garona Halforcen|Apparently. I will... consider it.}}

===Gossip===
Several of the guests have new gossip text during the feast. Others, however, retain their earlier gossip, listed on [[The Kosh'harg]].

;[[Arnak Fireblade]]
:[[Mordak Darkfist|We]] finally worked up the courage to talk to [[Lantresor of the Blade|Lantresor]]! He said he has not spoken to anyone from [[Burning Blade clan|our clan]] since the invasion of Azeroth.
:I feel like I could be sliced in half at any moment if I say the wrong thing to him. I am unworthy of being in his presence!

;[[Durak]]
:Hey, <name>. I...
:I just wanted to say that you did great with the om'gora. I was worried about my chances, when it is my turn--but you've shown me what it takes. I can't wait until I'm old enough to do this myself!
:So, um... Thank you. For showing me the way.

;[[Farseer Aggralan]]
:Eitrigg's faith in you was not misplaced. You have demonstrated to all what successful om'gora should be.
:And it appears you have also made fans out of both of my children. They will surely wish to follow the path of the <class> after your performance.

;[[Garona Halforcen]]
:I have never belonged to a clan. Being [[Half-breed|half-blooded]] used to mark you as an outcast.
:<She looks around Razor Hill, at the [[Mok'nathal]], and [[Lantresor of the Blade]].>
:How times have changed. Perhaps I will take Thega up on her offer.

;[[High Warlord Cromush]]
:Alright, I will admit I am having a good time. Nothing like a good brawl to get the blood pumping.
:I'll make sure these grunts don't get too out of line, but keep your eyes peeled for flying tankards!

;[[Lantresor of the Blade]]
:[[Arnak Fireblade|These]] [[Mordak Darkfist|two]] say they are members of the [[Burning Blade clan|Burning Blade]], but they are loyal to Thrall and the New Horde. And they are not [[Blademaster]]s, but [[Warlock]]s.
:Hm. Perhaps I have spent too long in only [[Boulderfist clan|the company]] of [[ogre]]s, but I don't feel the need to cut them down. They may be the closest thing to kin I have left.

;[[Nazgrim]]
:It seems my brothers and sisters of the [[Warsong clan|Warsong Clan]] still acknowledge me as an orc of honor and skill. They do not hold it against me that I defended [[Garrosh Hellscream|the Warchief]] to my death, or that I am now... [[Death knight|this]].
:What's left of my cold, un-beating heart is warmed. Perhaps I do not need to be so distant to the living. Or, perhaps they are just being polite.

;[[Rehgar Earthfury]] for non-shaman
:I am not surprised that you were successful in your om'gora. You are mighty, and deserve the honor and glory you have earned.
:But I am surprised at how hopeful this event has made me feel. The spirits whisper of a renewal of our people. They mean to crack the shell of cynicism this hardened old soldier and gladiator had built up over the years...
:This seems to be the start of a bright future for us.

;Rehgar Earthfury to shaman
Ah, the orc of the hour. Throm'ka, Farseer.

The spirits tell me you are certain to succeed in your om'gora today. I know they speak true, for you have proven your might to the Earthen Ring time and time again.
Where have you been all this time?

;[[Rehze]]
:<Rehze seems to have warmed up to you a little. She is still blushing, but looks at you and smiles.>
:Thank you for being nice to Durak, <name>. You're really nice.

;[[Rexxar]]
:Come to check on us, <name>? Well, [[Leoroxx|my father]] has decided he is speaking to me.
:It is a start.

;[[Rokaro]]
:It{{Sic}} rare to see so many of the [[Shattered Hand clan|Shattered Hand]] together in one place. We are so often in the field.
:I hope this Kosh'harg gathering occurs more than once a generation!

;[[Scout Manslayer]]
:My family was from the [[Bleeding Hollow clan]]. I have many stories of their conquests in [[Khaz Modan]] during the [[Second War]].
:It is an honor to finally meet [[Jorin Deadeye|the son]] of [[Kilrogg Deadeye|Kilrogg]], and those of my clan who remained in [[Draenor]]. An honor I owe to your efforts, <name>.

;[[Shokia]]
:It is good to see everyone again. Especially General Nazgrim...
:{{Gossip|Where have you been all this time?}} ''(Produces the same dialogue as [[The Kosh'harg|earlier in the questline]].)''

;[[Tactical Officer Kilrath]]
:I appreciate that [[Jorin Deadeye|Deadeye]] wants to bring our clan back together, but I hope that doesn't mean he expects me to spend more time here.
:How do people look at this red ground all the time? It hurts my eyes! There's a reason I never volunteered for missions in [[Hellfire Peninsula]].

;[[Herezegor Flametusk]]
:I cannot believe that Thrall would extend an olive branch to the Dragonmaw like this. After our years in the Dark Horde, and Warlord Zaela commanding our forces under Hellscream? 

:This must be some sort of trick!

;[[Gorfax Angerfang]]
:The Dragonmaw have had many disagreements with Thrall in the past. I hope this Kosh'harg will do much to unite us again.

;[[Mallia]]
:In the spirit of fellowship among orcs, Artesh and I have been extended an invitation to join the Earthen Ring by the new Farseer, Aggralan. 

:So the Frostwolf of Outland says, but old prejudices are not so easily put down among the orcs of Azeroth. 

:I will spend time scrying the outcomes before we decide. Despite our personal feelings, we must do as the spirits will.

;[[Eitrigg]]
:It warms my heart for so many of us to be together again, and not to march off to war!

:{{Gossip|Saurfang had a message for you.}}

::{{Text|say|Hah! Only in death would he admit it. Ah, I miss him.}}
