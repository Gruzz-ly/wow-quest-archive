==Objectives==
Remove 8 Suspicious Crates.
* [[Suspicious Crate (Durotar)|Suspicious Crates]] removed (8)

==Description==
In the chaos of the rockslides, [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] dispatched her saboteurs to sneak past our sentries and plant bombs on our siege weaponry. 

Several of them have already been lost. We cannot afford to lose more.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We'll need those siege engines if we're to have any hope of winning this battle.

==Completion==
Our people are tired and our resources are dwindling. We need every weapon and soldier at our disposal if we are to take the city.

==Notes==
The crates are scattered around the staging area next to Alliance and Horde siege engines. Removing them may also provoke nearby [[Suspicious Technician]]s (objectives for the concurrent quest [[Already Among Us (Alliance)]]).

==Progression==
{{Breaking the Cycle Alliance}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.2.5|note=Added.}}
