==Objectives==
Find the Hidden Cache in the cliffs surrounding the [[Valley of Trials]]. Learn the rune inside, then report back to [[Rwag]] in The [[Den]].

Learn Spell:
*Engrave Gloves - [[Shadowstrike (rogue rune)]]

==Description==
I have prepared a training exercise for you, <name>. I have hidden a cache among the cliffs nearby. You can see it if you stand by the fire in the center of the village. Within the cache is a [[Rune system|rune]] of great power.

Your test is to acquire this rune, and return when you have learned its secrets.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*90 [[XP]]
*[[Cracked Leather Gloves]]
*{{Race|Orc|notext}} +50 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*{{Race|Troll|notext}} +50 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Have you found the rune, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Applying the rune to your equipment will grant you powerful new abilities.

There are many such runes throughout [[Azeroth]]. Seek them out, as they will help along your journey.

==Notes==
Head to the area with [[Sarkoth]] and start carefully jumping on the rocks at {{Co|42.11|69.16|Durotar (Classic)}}. Find the [[Hidden Cache]] at {{Co|43.2|69.6|Durotar (Classic)}} to loot the [[Rune of Shadowstrike]] and use it to learn the recipe.
