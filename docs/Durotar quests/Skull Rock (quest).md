==Objectives==
Gather 6 Searing Collars from the cultists in [[Skull Rock]].
* [[Searing Collar]] (6)

==Description==
<Name>. The [[Burning Blade]] has infested the cave east of [[Orgrimmar]] known as [[Skull Rock]]. Inside that cave they perform vile rituals, and burn their own flesh with Searing Collars.

By wearing these collars, I believe the cultists attune themselves to demonic power. But to confirm this, I must have a collection of the collars to study.

Go to Skull Rock and gather Searing Collars from the cultists you find there. Bring them to me, and I will uncover their secrets.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Blade Cultist Slippers
|Searing Bracers
|Skull Rock Belt
|Burning Armbands
}}

You will also receive:
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
* +250 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Have you yet entered Skull Rock, <name>?  Do you have the Searing Collars?

==Completion==
Good.  Hiding within these collars is the secret behind the Burning Blade.  And I will uncover that secret... 

==Notes==
[[Skull Rock]]{{coords|55|11|Durotar}} is a cave north of [[Margoz]]'s position at the base of the mountains towards the coast. Enter the cave and kill [[Burning Blade]] cultists until you have collected enough [[Searing Collar]]s.

Like earlier quest [[The Burning Blade (quest)]], enemies in the cavern have a high chance of inflicting Felblood on the player upon their death. Same warnings apply, but this point, it's easier to survive to gain 5 stacks of this debuff and transform into a demon for 1 minute, granting you increased health regeneration and critical hit rate along with immunity to further Felblood. Take advantage of this to help finish the quest.

When the quest is completed:
:{{text|emote|Margoz enters a trance...}}
:{{text|emote|Margoz is burned by unleashed magic!}}
:{{text|say|Margoz|Argh!}}
:{{text|say|Margoz|<Name>, unlocking the secret of these collars is beyond my skills...}}

This quest is followed by: [[Arnak Fireblade (quest)]].
