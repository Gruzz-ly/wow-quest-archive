==Objectives==
Use the [[:Alcohol-Free Brewfest Sampler]] to hit S.T.O.U.T. 5 times.
*[[Self-Turning and Oscillating Utility Target|S.T.O.U.T.]] Hit (5)

==Description==
Hey, you look like you've got a good arm!

Look, I'll give it to you straight. Sometimes we have a bit of trouble with [[Alemental|the ale]] rampaging around the campgrounds. We paid good money to get these vendors and their brew here! We can't be wasting any of it, let alone having it come alive!

The easiest way to return the ale to its proper form is to throw a mug at it. Drink from the samplers and throw the mug at S.T.O.U.T. here. Prove that you'll be able to defend our property! 

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|11|70|}}
*10x [[Brewfest Prize Token]]

==Progress==
Chug from the mug, then chuck the mug at S.T.O.U.T. I think he can withstand the pounding. I wouldn't have stol.. er... built him if he couldn't!

==Completion==
Hey! He didn't break!

I mean uh... you did it! Your aim is true, or at least true enough to help guard the camp. The ale won't know what hit it!

==Notes==
Walk into the tent near the tables. Pick up a mug. Face S.T.O.U.T and drink. Pick up another mug. Repeat.

==Original version==
{{rfg-section|8.2.0}}
;Description

Those pesky [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Irons]] are back! We need to make sure that you can defend yourself if needed. More importantly, we need to know that you can defend our property!

S.T.O.U.T. here is ready for action, are you? Drink from the Alcohol-Free Brewfest Samplers then throw the mug at S.T.O.U.T.! Hit the target 5 times then talk to me.

;Completion
Wow... S.T.O.U.T. didn't break... Hmm... Who would have guessed?

I mean, hey, you did it! Your aim is true, or at least true enough to help guard the camp. I think you're ready now to take on the Dark Irons if they show up again.
