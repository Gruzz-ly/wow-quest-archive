==Objectives==
Report to [[Elthyn Da'rai]] at the Illidari camp in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
It would seem I underestimated your initial value.

We will have need of [[demon hunter|your kind]] in the coming war. I plan to hunt these [[demon]]s to the ends of [[Azeroth]], and your kind will be the arrow I shall loose upon them.

Tell your [[Illidari]] within Orgrimmar to make ready to serve the Horde.

But make no mistake, your kind once served [[Illidan Stormrage|the Betrayer]]. Betray me, and there is no world you can run to that will save you from my vengeance.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|11|60}}

==Completion==
You have proven our worth to the new Warchief. Excellent work.

To vanquish the Legion, we will need the Horde's strength at our backs.

==Notes==
It was originally followed by [[Calling of the Council (Horde)]].
