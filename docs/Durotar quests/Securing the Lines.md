== Objectives ==
Kill 12 [[Durotar]] [[harpy|harpies]]. Any type of harpy will suffice.
* Durotar Harpy slain (12)

== Description ==
[[Gazlowe]] told me once, "Rezlak. There's one thing you need to know in life, and that's if you want something done well, do it yourself."

I can't deal with losing all our caravans, so I'm just going to take matters into my own hands. [[harpy|Harpies]] plague our supply routes. If we kill the harpies, the caravans are safe. <!--previous text: [[Drygulch Ravine]] lies through the eastern part of [[Razorwind Canyon]]. If we kill all the [[harpy|harpies]] there, the routes will be safe.-->

Of course, there was one other thing that Gazlowe taught me, and that's "You can get anything done for a price." You in, <name>? Good...I recommend starting in the [[Razorwind Canyon|canyon to the east]].

== Rewards ==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Harpy Wing Clipper
|Hickory Shortbow
|Blemished Wooden Staff
|Jagged Wing Slasher
}}

You will also receive:
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
* +250 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]
* +250 reputation with [[Ratchet]]

== Progress ==
You wouldn't think it from a guy like my boss Gazlowe, but he always seemed to know the score. "Don't be afraid to take that big step," he said.

Harpies won't stop bothering us and the caravans won't stop being attacked unless we do something about it, eh?

== Completion ==
I think I can breathe easy now, knowing that the harpies won't be bothering our supply caravans anymore. And not one moment too soon, either. I hear I'm being sent some fun little toys with the next shipment!

You're pretty good at what you do, <name>, you ought to track down my boss in [[Ratchet]]. I'll bet he could find some work for you.

Oh, and don't worry, I wouldn't forget to pay you for the service you provided me.

== Notes ==
Pick up [[Winds in the Desert]] from {{NPC||Rezlak}} as well and you can pick up supplies while you kill harpies to complete both quests.

The harpies are found in two areas. Both areas can be found by going into the canyon that leads to [[Razor Hill]], then turning either right or left midway through the canyon. Either way will lead to [[Razorwind Canyon]], which is filled with harpies: [[Dustwind Harpy]], [[Dustwind Pillager]]s, [[Dustwind Savage]]s, [[Dustwind Storm Witch]]es.
