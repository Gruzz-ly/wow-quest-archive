==Objectives==
Gather 10 Motes of Primal Energy from enemies in active primal storm locations throughout [[Kalimdor]] and the [[Eastern Kingdoms]].
*[[Mote of Primal Energy (Tempest Unleashed)]] (10)

==Description==
[[Raszageth]] has wasted no time building up her [[Primalist]] forces.

The [[Kirin Tor]] have detected massive storms being unleashed at key points across Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms.

The Primalists are unleashing the elements to add to their strength. It seems they plan to cause chaos not only in the [[Dragon Isles]], but in the lands of the [[Alliance]] and [[Horde]] as well.

Seek out the enemy and study their methods. We have to stop them before it's too late.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*9,050 [[XP]]
*30x [[Primeval Essence]]
*[[Primal Stormling]]

==Progress==
I'm afraid this is only the beginning.

==Completion==
It is good you thwarted their attack, at least for now.

<Khadgar examines the motes you brought him.>

Hmm, primal elemental energy. I will take this for further study.

==Notes==
Participate in the [[Tempest Unleashed]] world event!
