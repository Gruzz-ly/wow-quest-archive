# Durotar storyline

[[File:WorldMap-Durotar.jpg|thumb|Zone map]]

The '''Durotar storyline''' picks up from the [[Troll starting experience|troll]] and [[Orcish starting experience|orc starting experiences]] in [[Echo Isles]] and [[Valley of Trials]], respectively. In it players travel North through [[Durotar]], starting with Sen'jin Village in the South and ending at the Dranosh'ar Blockade leading into Orgrimmar.

==Sen'jin Village==
In [[Sen'jin Village]] players meet [[Master Gadrin]] who is having trouble as humans from [[Northwatch Hold]] have started landing on the coasts of Durotar. They are preparing to invade the zone, as evidenced by attack plans discovered in [[The War of Northwatch Aggression]]. Under the direction of Master Gadrin and [[Lar Prowltusk]], players disrupt the Northwatch supply chains and destroy their plans. With the threat temporarily subdued, Master Gadrin sends players onwards to Razor Hill to ask for reinforcements.

==Razor Hill==
In [[Razor Hill]] players are introduced to [[Gar'Thok]] who immediately denies Master Gadrin's request for reinforcements, claiming that he is swamped by his own problems. To start, the Northwatch forces have holed up in [[Tiragarde Keep]] and then on top of that, the [[water elemental]]s of the region have started acting up. While helping Gar'Thok with these problems, players encounter [[Gail Nozzywig]], a resourceful Goblin who is seeking to turn a profit from the destruction caused by the Cataclysm.

After clearing up the problems around Razor Hill, Gail remembers that her boyfriend [[Thonk]] was looking for help some time ago and she sends players to help him. It turns out Thonk is watching over the Southfury Watershed and he needs players to rescue anyone trapped in the watershed. Players head into the Watershed in [[Watershed Patrol]] and have to rescue [[Raggaran]], who has them kill Quilboar first, [[Grandmatron Tekla]], who needs to be escorted out, [[Misha Tor'kren]], who is making a necklace for her dead son, and [[Zen'Taji]], who is trying to help the local plainstriders. After helping each of them, they will leave the Watershed and the quest can finally be completed. With all the quests in Razor taken care of, players can explore Durotar and find a few more quests around the zone. Alternatively, a breadcrumb to the [[Northern Barrens]] is available from [[Takrin Pathseeker]].

==Beyond Razor Hill==
Outside of Razor Hill there are a couple of miscellaneous quests that can be picked up. The major quest line starts with [[The Burning Blade]] and has players travel to the [[Dranosh'ar Blockade]] where they seek out [[Burning Blade]] cultists in the nearby [[Skull Rock]] and Southfury Watershed. While at the Blockade, players enter into a minor conflict between the two commanders [[Shin Stonepillar]] and [[Gor the Enforcer]], eventually taking Gor's side and clearing out the nearby Elementals. Other quests available in Durotar include a small chain helping the Goblin [[Rezlak]] recover after he was attacked by [[Dustwind]] [[Harpy|harpies]] and visiting [[Spiketooth]] in Deadeye Shore where he has players fight his gladiators.
