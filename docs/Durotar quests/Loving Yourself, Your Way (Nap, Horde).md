==Objectives==
Take a nap in the inn at [[Razor Hill]].
* Speak to [[Innkeeper Grosk]]
* Bed cleaned
* Bugs stomped (5)
* Pillow fluffed (2)
* Nap taken

==Description==
While visiting this gala, I am staying at the Razor Hill inn. It may not look like much, but it is surprisingly comfortable!

Why don't you see if they have any extra beds you could use?

I think I will have a bit of a rest too... Right... here...

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20|}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
<Ning is quietly snoring.>

==Completion==
...Huh? Oh! Welcome back, did you enjoy your rest?

On any other day, you do great deeds for others.

Today you have done something great for yourself. And that is the best gift of all.

==Notes==
;Upon accept
:''Ning goes to sleep.''

;Entering the inn
:{{Text|say|Innkeeper Grosk|Welcome! Our apologies for any delays. We will have fresh beds ready shortly.}}

Speak to Grosk:
:Welcome! Our apologies for any delays. We will have fresh beds ready shortly.

:{{Gossip|quest=|I would like to rest here.}}
::I would love to offer you a bed. Unfortunately, today we do not have enough staff to clean all of the beds.

::If you would like to clean one yourself, please go ahead.

Interact with the [[Messy Bed]], after which [[Bed Bug]]s appear. Stomp them. After, interact with the [[Pillow]] twice. Then the [[Comforting Bed]] is ready to be used for a nap. After the nap, [[Snuzormu]] is by the exit:
:I love sleep so much! 

:Maybe I was a [[green dragon]] in a different timeline...

:{{Gossip|What are you doing here?}}
::I came to bring you an important message from [[Chronormu]]! But then I saw you sleeping and decided to help.

::I sped up your timeline so you could get lots of extra sleep!

::{{Gossip|Thanks?}}
:::You're welcome! Delivering messages is tiring work!
::{{Gossip|What message?}}
:::I... forgot. Sorry.

:::If it was really important, I'm sure you'll see me another time!
