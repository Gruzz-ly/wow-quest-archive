==Objectives==
Defeat Griswold Hanniston in combat.
*[[ Griswold Hanniston]] defeated

==Description==
[[Griswold Hanniston|Griswold]], chained up over there on the cliffs, is my newest gladiator. We found him just south of here, sniffing around with [[Northwatch]] soldiers. I had my men nab him up, and now he works for me.

He looks tough enough, but he hasn't really been battle-tested yet. Go pick a fight with him so I can see if he's worth keeping around.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}

==Progress==
How did you do?

==Completion==
I'm at a crossroads now, <name>... you defeated him easily in combat, but then again, I did get him for free, and he's pretty cheap to feed. Maybe we'll keep him around for a bit.

==Notes==
{{Raidicon|Skull}} [[Griswold Hanniston]] is chained to the base of the cliffs on the coast just north of Spiketooth's position.

Click on him, and he asks:
:What's the matter, chum... never seen a [[worgen]] before?

:{{Gossip|I'm here to challenge you in combat.}}

Defeat him (you can't kill him) and return to Spiketooth.
