==Objectives==
Speak with Tethris Dewgazer at the [[Pathfinder's Den]] in Orgrimmar.
*Speak with [[Tethris Dewgazer]] in [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
My egg! My precious egg! While I was shooing some stragglers away from the inn, a flock showed up and made off with some of our decorations and eggs. My beautiful golden heirloom was among the items stolen!

Enough is enough. We simply must put an end to this [[duck]] invasion.

Please, <name>. These pilfering poultry must be stopped! Fortunately, I know a [[mage]] in Orgrimmar who might just have a solution for us.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Brightly Colored Egg]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Have you spoken with Tethris yet?

==Completion==
Don't worry, I'm sure he'll have a good solution. Wait here, I think I see a portal forming.

==Notes==
Head to the Pathfinder's Den in Orgrimmar and speak with Tethris Dewgazer:
:What do you need?

:{{Gossip|quest=|Sylnaria sent me...}}
::Sylnaria sent you, did she? Tell her that I didn't become an [[Archmage]] simply to deal with such trivial things.

::If it's so important to her, I'll look into a potion to communicate with the ducks. But she owes me.

Upon completion, Tethris teleports to Razor Hill.

==Progression==
