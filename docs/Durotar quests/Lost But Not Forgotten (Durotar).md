== Objectives ==
Obtain 250 Crocolisk Teeth.
*[[Durotar Crocolisk Tooth]] (250)

== Description ==
Today marks the anniversary of my son [[Kron (orc)|Kron]]'s passing. As long as I refused to admit it, I recognize now: Kron is not returning from his crocolisk hunt.

I've been working on a project... something that will memorialize Kron's passion for the hunt. It's a crocolisk-tooth necklace... rows and rows of teeth, suitable to be worn by only the bravest young orc. I will place it on his grave.

Kron was brave, but he was not strong, like you. Will you bring me the teeth for my necklace?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Hand Woven Vest
|Lovingly Embroidered Belt
|Tunic of Celebration
|Fine Crocolisk Scale Belt
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Progress ==
Kron will be remembered.

== Completion ==
Thank you, <race>.  I will get to work on the necklace right away.

Before Kron died, I had made this for him to wear.  I have no use for it now, but perhaps you might.

==Notes==
This quest is a requirement to complete the quest [[Watershed Patrol]]. Completing this quest results in achieving the objective "Help Misha Tor'kren".

[[Dreadmaw Toothgnasher]]s (found in the [[Southfury Watershed]] and the [[Southfury River]]) drop 29-39 teeth. You will have to kill about 10 [[crocolisk]]s to get 250 teeth.

This quest replaced the pre-Cataclysm quest [[Lost_But_Not_Forgotten_(Classic)]] - an infuriating quest where you had to recover [[Kron's Amulet]] from the crocolisk that ate him. The drop rate for the amulet was very low, so you had to kill lots and lots of crocolisks to get it.
