==Objectives==
Find the [[Hidden Cache]] in the cliffs behind [[Frang]]. Learn the rune inside, then report back to Frang in the [[Valley of Trials]].

Learn Spell:
*Engrave Gloves - [[Victory Rush (warrior rune)]]

==Description==
Above all else, a [[warrior]] of the [[Horde]] must be of strong body. On your journey, you will undergo many trials of stamina and endurance.

To this end, I have hidden a cache among the cliffs behind me. You can see it if you stand by the fire in the center of the village. Reaching it will be no easy feat. Within the cache is a rune of great power.

Your test is to find this rune, and return when you have learned its secrets.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*90 [[XP]]
*[[Tarnished Chain Gloves]]
*{{Race|Orc|notext}} +50 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*{{Race|Troll|notext}} +50 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Have you found the rune, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Applying the rune to your equipment will grant you powerful new abilities.

There are many such runes throughout [[Azeroth]]. Seek them out, as they will help along your journey.

==Notes==
Head to the area with [[Sarkoth]] and start carefully jumping on the rocks at {{Co|42.11|69.16|Durotar (Classic)}}. Find the [[Hidden Cache]] at {{Co|43.2|69.6|Durotar (Classic)}} to loot the [[Rune of Victory Rush]] and use it to learn the recipe.
