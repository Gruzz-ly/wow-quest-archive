==Objectives==
Speak to Tokag Bonebreaker at the [[Gala of Gifts]], then relieve your stress in [[Orgrimmar]].
*Speak with [[Tokag Bonebreaker]]
*Stress relieved (0/100%)
*Return to Tokag Bonebreaker at the Gala of Gifts.

==Description==
You [[adventurer]]s are known to carry heavy burdens. There will be no better time to confront them than now.

I saw a veteran somewhere around here. There is a chance he may know what it means to cope with stress.

Perhaps he has insight to teach you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
I've seen men die of stress, you don't want to bottle it up every day.

==Completion==
Feeling better? 

You must take care of your body after a tough day. Be good to your head and heart and they'll be good to you.

==Notes==
Speak with Tokag at {{co|41.31|17.47|Durotar}}:
:{{Gossip|quest=|How do you relieve stress?}}
::Now that's the question, isn't it?

::Stress builds up in your heart, in your muscles. The energy must be released.

::Screaming helps. Or if you prefer, the [[Valley of Honor]] has training dummies to beat down. There's always rubbish in the streets you could kick, if you need to.

::Let loose. The relief it gives you... it feels like love.

Following Tokag's advice, head to Orgrimmar's [[Drag]] and kick [[Discarded Trash]] (+3%).

in the Valley of Honor and the [[Barracks (Orgrimmar)|Barracks]], hit a dummy (+1% every second). Use the Yell extra action button when available or interact with the [[Abandoned Pillow]]s (+6%).

The adventurer screams:
:{{Text|yell|<Name>|Aaaahhhhhh!}}
:{{Text|yell|<Name>|Aaaarrrrgghhhh!}}

And nearby onlookers react:
:{{Text|say|[[Orgrimmar Grunt]]|It's like that some days.}}
:{{Text|say|Orgrimmar Grunt|Are you okay?}}
:{{Text|say|Orgrimmar Grunt|What's wrong with you?}}
:{{Text|say|[[Lovely Reveler]]|Need a hug?}}
:{{Text|say|Lovely Reveler|I completely understand.}}
