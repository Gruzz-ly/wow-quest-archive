==Objectives==
Talk to [[Cook Torka]] to learn about crafting your offering.

==Description==
The blessing of the ancestors is meant to teach young [[orc]]s that the living owe everything to those that came before. We must honor the ancestors, seek their wisdom, and live up to their expectations.

Your task is to craft an offering worthy of the honored dead, and worthy of being the centerpiece at the offering stone of the first [[Kosh'harg]] of [[Azeroth]]! You must put all of your energy into its construction, or it will not be enough.

Cook Torka will guide you. The ancestors will be watching.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
So, the big hero comes to Cook Torka for help, eh?

Fine, but you're going to have to do most of the work yourself!

==Notes==
On accept, [[Durak]] starts accompanying the player. His mounts are a [[Winter|frost wolf]] and a [[wyvern]].

:{{Text|say|Farseer Aggralan|Do your best to stay out of the way.}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|Of course I will!}}

Durak's gossip text:
:Thanks for letting me come with you. I'll do my best to help!

:One day soon, I'll have to do this myself...
