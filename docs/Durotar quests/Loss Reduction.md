== Objectives ==
Rescue 4 Injured Razor Hill Grunts.
*{{NPC||Injured Razor Hill Grunt}} rescued x4

== Description ==
You've got to help us. The elementals... they're stronger than they look, and they come in waves. They took us completely by surprise, and we were overcome.

Many of my fellow grunts lay dying on the beach. If you could save them... I would be grateful, as would Gar'Thok back in Razor Hill.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||1|75}} and [[Razor Hill Grunt's Bracers]]

== Completion ==
I've already spoken with several orcs that have returned from the beach.  All of them told me that you were the one who saved them.

You've done a noble task today, <name>.  Lok'tar ogar!  For the Horde!

== Notes ==
You should come across [[Injured Razor Hill Grunt]]s while doing [[Storming the Beaches]] and [[Shipwreck Searching]]. It does not become available until you have completed the quest preceding Storming the Beaches, [[From Bad to Worse]]. Although the grunts will '''not''' have an exclamation mark above their heads, speak to one to begin this side quest.

After speaking to each grunt, s/he will say something encouraging before following the player around for a while, saying they need to recover. They will then run off.
