==Description==
;Female character
You! Stop right there, you tramp! I'm not finished with you yet.

I hear you're headed off to the shore east of here. The beach is filled with crashed ships, and those ships have gnomish tools in them... tools that I can use.

Get cracking, missy!

;Male character
Hey handsome, welcome back! You wouldn't mind running another errand, would you? I'd be EVER so grateful...

I hear you're headed off to the shore east of here. The beach is filled with crashed ships, and those ships have gnomish tools in them... tools that I can use.

See you soon, beefcake!

*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
;Female
Well?

;Male
Has my knight in shining armor returned?

==Completion==
;Female
Well, I suppose you're not completely useless. Now stay away from my men!

;Male
You really know how to treat a girl, you know that?  If you ever need anything...

==Notes==
The [[Gnomish Tools]] are in the Gnomish Toolboxes scattered all over the beach and ships. 

Speak to one of the [[Injured Razor Hill Grunt]]s lying about the area to start the side quest [[Loss Reduction]].
