==Objectives==
Talk to [[Brewmaster Tao]] in the [[Brewfest Grounds (Durotar)|Brewfest grounds]].

==Description==
<As the brew is returned to its natural, dormant form, a strange keg appears.

Perhaps Brewmaster Tao knows more about such a strange occurrence.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|23|40|}}
*17,850 [[XP]]
*10x [[Brewfest Prize Token]]

==Completion==
Everything has a spirit to it. From the clouds in the sky to the worms in the ground, life is woven through the entire world.

Brew is no different. Created with such love, such care... it only requires a spark to spring to life in front of our very eyes.
