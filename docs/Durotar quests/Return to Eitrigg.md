==Objectives==
Speak with [[Burok]] and purchase a flight back to [[Orgrimmar]]. Once in Orgrimmar, bring [[Gar'Thok]]'s Reports to [[Eitrigg]] in the [[Valley of Strength]].
*[[Gar'Thok's Reports]] (provided)

==Description==
Since you've already spoken to Doras, you'll be able to hire a wind rider to take you right back to Orgrimmar. Each time you arrive in a new town, be sure to speak with the town's [[flight master]]. After that, you'll be able to use the flight master's services to travel quickly.

Speak to me again when you're ready to purchase a return flight to Orgrimmar. Bring those reports to Eitrigg in the Valley of Strength once you've landed.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{cost|2|50|}} (or {{cost||3|90}} if completed at level 90)
*630 [[XP]]
*+150 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Did you bring those reports?

==Completion==
<Eitrigg examines the reports.>

The [[Alliance]] has grown bolder than we'd thought! I'll talk to the [[warchief]] about sending reinforcements right away. Thank you for getting these reports to me so quickly. I hope this coin is enough to cover your travel expenses.
