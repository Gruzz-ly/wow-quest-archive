==Description==
In here is a recipe for the traditional feast left for the ancestors at the [[Kosh'harg]] by the clans. We're going to have to substitute some ingredients that, you know, no longer exist...

But it will for the better! We'll bring some [[Azeroth]] flair to this traditional dish!

I will teach you each piece of the recipe, but it will be up to you to gather the ingredients and actually cook it. Orc traders have come from all over, so you should be able to find everything you need right here in Razor Hill.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Did we find everything on the list? Torka said we could probably find everything in Razor Hill!

==Completion==
We tracked down everything on our list!

What's next?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Cook Torka|Don't forget to read my cookbook. It has the recipes you will need!}}

Interact with [[:Spoons and Forks]] to read it and automatically learn the [[Cooking]] recipes for [[Curried Coconut Crab]], [[Grilled Southfury Salmon]], [[Spicy Seared Talbuk Steak]], and [[Feast for the Ancestors]].
:{{Text|say|Durak|Wow, we need a lot. I'll start a list!}}

All of the ingredients are obtainable from vendors around town. [[Nula the Butcher]] sells [[Fresh Talbuk Steak]]. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Durak|That's Nula, from [[Garadar]]! She'll have [[talbuk]] meat.}}

[[Suja]] sells [[Isle Lemon]], [[Un'goro Coconut]], and [[Suja's Sweet Salt]]. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Suja|I hear you're cooking a grand feast, <name>!}}
:{{Text|say|Suja|I bet I have some things you can use! Take a look at my stock!}}

[[Rok'kal]] creates a [[Crate of Crabs]] on approach:
:{{Text|say|Rok'kal|Hey, <name>! We brought these freshly caught crabs for your offering!}}

Interacting with the Crate spawns several [[Escaped Crab]]s that scuttle around the area. Loot two of them for [[Durotar Coast Crab]].
:{{Text|say|Rok'kal|Oh no! Grab them quick, before they escape!}}

[[Razgar]] sells [[Southfury Salmon]]. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Durak|One of these fishermen should have the salmon we need!}}

The [[Keg of Ancestral Ale]] is available for free from [[Kyl'kahn]], who is arguing with [[Cort Gorestein]] beside the inn. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Durak|Are those two arguing about ale? Grown ups are strange.}}

Talk to Kyl'kahn:
:Don't mind us. We always get to arguing about which brews are better when we get together like this.
:{{Gossip|I need a keg of ale for my offering to the ancestors.}}
:You've come to the right orc! Here, on the house.
:[[Warpath Ales]] is honored to be part of your [[om'gora]]!

[[Far'kul Flametongue]] sells [[Farahlon Fenugreek]], [[Ground Gorgrond Pepper]], and [[Zandali Piri Piri]]. On approach:
:{{Text|say|Durak|That guy over there looks a little shady... but we should see what he has for sale.}}

When all ingredients have been gathered:
:{{Text|say|Durak|That's everything! Now you just need to cook it!}}
