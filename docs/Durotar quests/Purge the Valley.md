==Objectives==
Defeat 12 Northwatch troops in [[Northwatch Foothold]]. 
*[[Northwatch Infantryman|Northwatch Infantrymen]] or [[Northwatch Ranger]]s slain (12)

==Description==
[[Northwatch]] is a highly-defended stronghold southwest of here, across the harbor. It's a strategically-located stronghold that the [[Horde]] still struggles to overtake. We don't need the humans setting up another Northwatch here in [[Durotar]].

Sweep through the valley to the west and slay these [[human]]s, <name>. Let them know the power and the fury of [[Sen'jin Village|Sen'jin]].

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You may choose one of the following:|Sen'jin Staff|Sen'jin Bow}}

You will also receive: {{cost||1|25}}

==Progress==
Slay them all.

==Completion==
A battle well-fought, <class>, but I still have my doubts about our effectiveness.  These humans don't seem to be going anywhere.

You, however, have done more than could reasonably be asked of any loyal member of the Horde.  Thank you.

==Notes==
This quest should be done along with [[The War of Northwatch Aggression]].
