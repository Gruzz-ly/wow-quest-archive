==Warchief's Command==
;Broken Shore
The [[Burning Legion]] has returned to [[Azeroth]]!

==Objectives==
Check in with [[Holgar Stormaxe]] at the [[Dranosh'ar Blockade]].

==Description==
Warriors of da [[Horde]]! Break out ya axes and sharpen ya spears. Da [[Burning Legion]] has returned ta our world!

We be shipping outta [[Bladefist Bay]] right away. With da full fury of da Horde, we gonna smash der line so hard dat [[Sargeras]] is gonna feel it in da [[Twisting Nether|Nether]]!

Get to da ships. We got [[demon]]s ta slay!


Warchief<br/>
[[Vol'jin]]

==Completion==
The ships are leaving from the dock in Bladefist Bay.

Before you leave, prepare yourself. I have the feeling that this fight won't be an easy one.

==Notes==
;On accept
:{{text|say|Warchief Vol'jin|Warriors of da Horde, get ya axes and sharpen ya spears. Da [[Burning Legion]] has returned ta our world.}}

;On approach
:{{text|say|Holgar Stormaxe|Can you hear the roar of battle already, <name>? It calls to you!}}

[[Holgar Stormaxe]] offers an optional skip for players who have already completed the Broken Shore storyline on another character:
{{dialogue|
The scent of blood is on the winds.

{{gossip|I've heard this tale before... <Skip the Legion introductory quests and begin your journey in Dalaran.>}}
}}
This will place the character in [[Dalaran]] in the [[Broken Isles]], with [[In the Blink of an Eye]] ready for turn-in. If a player wishes to do the questline after activating the skip, [[Archivist Elysiana]] in the [[Violet Citadel]] offers it.

==Progression==
{{Broken Shore Horde}}
