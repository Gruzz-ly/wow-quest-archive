'''Gathering the Grub''' begins the mandatory [[Brewfest Banquet]] quests at [[Brewfest]].

==Objectives==
Collect Bags of Brewfest Ingredients and deposit them at the wagon.
* [[Bag of Brewfest Ingredients]] (5)
* Ingredients deposited (5)

==Description==
Ah, you're here. Brewfest has begun-but we've got a problem. Can't have a proper feast without food, and some thieving hozen thought it'd be clever to snatch our grub.

Here's what you'll do: track down those hozen and take back what's ours. You might find a few bags just lying around too-grab those. Once you've got the goods, toss them in the wagon behind me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|||5}}
* 30 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Brewfest Prize Token]]

==Progress==
The feast won't come together without those ingredients!

==Completion==
You've done it! The cooks will be pleased.

==Notes==
Once the bags have been collected from [[Brew Thief|Brew Thieves]] and [[Barrel Bandit]]s, head to the [[Ingredient Wagon]] and use the {{Abilities|Deposit Resources|id=||icon=}} extra action button.

==Progression==
# [[Gathering the Grub]]
# [[Brewmaster's Kitchen]]
# [[Serving with Style]]
