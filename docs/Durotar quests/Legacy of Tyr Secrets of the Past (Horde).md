==Objectives==
Enter [[Uldaman: Legacy of Tyr|Uldaman]] in [[Badlands]]. Discover the cause of the disturbances.
*[[Discs of Tyr|Disc of Tyr]]'s memories recovered

==Description==
To stop [[Raszageth]] from freeing the other [[Primal Incarnates|Incarnates]], the [[Dragon Aspects|Aspects]]' power must be restored.

But this will not be an easy task. The [[Titan]]s are silent and [[Tyr|Keeper Tyr]] is long dead.

[[Alexstrasza|Queen Alexstrasza]] has devised a plan. In the Badlands lies a Titan facility called [[Uldaman]]. She believes Tyr's companions hid a disc of his memories inside its depths.
 
Take your allies to Uldaman and find the disc for the Dragon Queen. Let us hope Tyr's knowledge can be used to re-empower the Aspects.
