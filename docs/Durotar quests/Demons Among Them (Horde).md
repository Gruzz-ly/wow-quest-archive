==Objectives==
Protect the [[Warchief]].
* Warn Warchief [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]
* Demons slain (12)

==Description==
It is just as we suspected, <name>! The demons thought they could take us by surprise.

Quickly, to arms! Protect the Banshee Queen!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive: {{cost|15|40}}
|Brand of the Banshee Queen}}

==Progress==
This is what we were born for.

==Completion==
Your warning just saved us from what might have been a catastrophic loss. Now we can unleash our vengeance upon this Legion filth.

You now have my attention, demon hunter... and perhaps a bit of appreciation as well.

==Notes==
Speak with Sylvanas to continue.

;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner
:You are the demon hunters who escaped the [[Vault of the Wardens]]?
:You draw your very power from those who seek to destroy our world. Tell me, why should I possibly trust you?
:{{gossip|This cannot wait. There are demons among your ranks. Let me show you.}}

An [[Legion in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|_d0dMgX83Ig|urlArgs=start=31&end=46}}
:''The player runs over to an [[Orgrimmar Grunt]], brandishing their glaives.''
:{{text|say|<Player>|You cannot hide what you truly are, [[demon]]!}}
:''The Orgrimmar Grunt laughs removes their disguise, revealing themselves to be a [[Felblade Assassin]].''
:{{text|say|Orgrimmar Grunt|You discovered us too late, [[Illidari]]! FELBLADE, ATTACK!}}
:''The camera pans to the right as more Fellblade Assassins are unveiled and a [[Shard of Hate]] crashes into the scene.''
:{{text|say|Allari the Souleater|More of them are in our midst!}}

On the other side of the cutscene, a phased encounter begins. Kill any 12 demons around the funeral area, then return to Sylvanas to turn in the quest.
