==Objectives==
Find the stolen spell notes inside the Burning Blade Coven, then use them to learn a new ability. Afterwards, return to Mai'ah in the Valley of Trails.
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Ice Lance (mage rune)]]
*[[Comprehension Primer]] (provided)

==Description==
As a mage, researching the arcane will lead you to astonishing power. Studying notes left by Azeroth's greatest mages is an excellent place to start. I had recently discovered some myself, but they were stolen by those pesky Burning Blade Familiars.

Recover the spell notes from the coven to the north and use this primer to decipher them. Return when your research is successful.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]
*[[Tattered Cloth Gloves]]
*[[Comprehension Charm]] x3

==Progress==
How is your research progressing, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Take these Comprehension Charms. They will help you decipher any more arcane writings you find.

Continue to seek out spell notes across Azeroth and use them to further your research. If you need more charms, pay a visit to a reagent vendor.
