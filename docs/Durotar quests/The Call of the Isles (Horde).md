==Objectives==
Meet [[Naleidea Rivergleam]] in [[Durotar]].

Our allies gather in Durotar. This is a very exciting time!

Join us, <name>! It's time to set sail for the [[Dragon Isles]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|2|57|40}}
*1,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I am so excited! Are you ready to begin our adventure together?

==Notes==
This breadcrumb quest is not a normal part of the quest chain; it exists primarily for characters who completed the previous quests during the [[Tempest Unleashed]] pre-launch event, to remind them that the quest chain can now be continued. However, it will also trigger if you attempt to leave the area after completing [[Whispers on the Winds (Horde)]] without accepting [[To the Dragon Isles! (Horde)]]

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|[[Dragonscale Expedition|Our expedition]] is ready to depart. Meet me outside [[Orgrimmar]], and together we shall venture to the Dragon Isles!}}
