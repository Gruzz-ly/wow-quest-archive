==Objectives==
Find the stolen rune inside of the [[Burning Blade Coven]]. Learn its power, then report back to [[Nartok]] in The [[Den]].
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Haunt (warlock rune)]]

==Description==
I've been experimenting with a new type of [[magic]] - a rune which can channel [[fel]] energies to fuel powerful spells. I would share this power with you, but it was stolen by one of those pesky [[Burning Blade]] [[familiar]]s.

Go to their coven, to the north, and see if you can find my rune stashed among their possessions. In my experience, the familiars tend to hide their plunder in hard to find places.

Once you find the rune, learn its magic and report back to me. I would like to see my experiment put to us

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*[[Tattered Cloth Gloves]]

==Progress==
Have you found the rune, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Applying the rune to your equipment will grant you powerful new abilities.

There are many such runes throughout [[Azeroth]]. Seek them out, as they will help along your journey.
