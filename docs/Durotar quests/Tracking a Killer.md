==Objectives==
Seek out information about [[Gor'krosh]], the Long Knives, from the residents of the [[Valley of Trials]].
*Clues found (5)

==Description==
Gor'krosh, the Long Knives, has been terrorizing the Valley of Trials for weeks. [[Orc]]s have been going missing, and many of our [[Adventurer|young trainees]] have been injured.

The [[peon]]s took to calling the mysterious attacker the Long Knives because the few bodies we have found all have long, terrible gashes across their backs. They're terrified, and refusing to work!

We have no idea who or what Gor'krosh really is, but they are clearly very dangerous. Please, find this monster and end this madness!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you learned anything about Gor'krosh?

==Completion==
What have you found?

<You tell Kaltunk about the three-toed print, [[Karranisha]]'s mention of [[raptor]]s, the peon witness account, and the bodies with deep slashes.>

So... you're telling me Gor'krosh is actually a huge, white raptor?!

==Notes==
[[File:Karranisha.jpg|thumb|[[Karranisha]].]]
The five clues are scattered around the area and can be interacted with in any order.

Talk to [[Karranisha]] the hunter trainer:{{Co|43.4|70.6|Valley of Trials}}
:I've been seeing some evidence of raptors nearby. Strange to see them this far from the [[Barrens]].
:{{Gossip|Have you seen any evidence of Gor'krosh?}}
:Huh? I'm not even sure Gor'krosh exists. Those peons get worked up over everything.

Approach [[Zureetha Fargaze]] and [[Foreman Thazz'ril]], who are standing over a [[Dead Peon]]:{{Co|46|63.4|Valley of Trials}}
:{{Text|say|Foreman Thazz'ril|Not another one! I can't keep losing peons like this!}}
:{{Text|say|Zureetha Fargaze|Long gashes from something like a blade, same as the others.}}
:{{Text|say|Foreman Thazz'ril|Do you really think it was Gor'krosh that did this?}}
:{{Text|say|Zureetha Fargaze|I cannot say, but we must take this seriously. This is the third dead with the same wounds.}}
:{{Text|say|Foreman Thazz'ril|The third we've found, you mean! I'm still missing two more!}}

[[File:Tracking a Killer - peons.jpg|thumb|The Terrified Peon next to his fallen friend.]]
Approach a [[Terrified Peon]] cowering next to another Dead Peon under a tree in the east:{{Co|52.4|68.65|Valley of Trials}}
:{{Text|say|Terrified Peon|Aaaahh!! Don't hurt me!}}
:{{Text|say|Terrified Peon|Please spare me Mister Gor'krosh! I'll be good peon!}}

Talk to him:
:No no no no no...
:{{Gossip|What happened here?}}
:Big monster jump out! Pale as ghost! Kill friend, then vanish!
:Please, do not let it kill me!

[[File:Tracking a Killer - adventurer.jpg|thumb|The Injured Adventurer and her undelivered Bag of Cactus Apples.]]
Approach an [[Injured Adventurer (Durotar)|Injured Adventurer]] kneeling next to a [[:Bag of Cactus Apples]] by some rock formations in the northeast:{{Co|50|60.1|Valley of Trials}}
:{{Text|say|Injured Adventurer|Please... I don't think I will make it...}}
:{{Text|say|Injured Adventurer|Take... the [[Cactus Apple|cactus apples]]...}}
:''The adventurer dies.''

When talked to:
:<She is gone. You see two large, bloody gashes across her back.>

The Bag of Cactus Apples offers the optional side quest [[Galgar's Cactus Apple Surprise...]]

Further east, interact with the [[Beast Tracks]] for the final clue:{{Co|54.2|62.46|Valley of Trials}}
:<You have found a very large three-toed print left by an animal.
:It is surely from a raptor or something similar.
:This is very alarming evidence that Gor'krosh is real and nearby.>
:{{Gossip|I should tell Kaltunk about this.}}
