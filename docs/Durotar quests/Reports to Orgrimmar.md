==Objectives==
Take Gar'Thok's Reports to [[Burok]] at [[Razor Hill]].
*[[Gar'Thok's Reports]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Eitrigg]] will have to be happy with the part of the report that I've finished. Tell him to expect more in the future.

<Gar'Thok hands you a stack of roughly folded papers.>

This should cover the most important details of the increase in [[Alliance]] forces working out of [[Northwatch]]. Please apologize to Eitrigg for me and let him know that we've had our hands full here, trying to keep Razor Hill secure and supplied. When you're ready to return to [[Orgrimmar]], simply speak to Burok and hire a wind rider.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*85 [[XP]]
*+10 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Are you ready to return to Orgrimmar?

==Completion==
Ready to return to Orgrimmar with those reports? I can arrange a flight for you right away.
