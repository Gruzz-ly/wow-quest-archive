*[[Kul Tiras Treasure]] (6)

==Description==
;Male character
Hey there, handsome!  I've had my eye on those big, beefy biceps ever since you stepped into town.

Listen, I've got something for you to do.  I hear [[Gar'Thok]]'s got you headed over to [[Tiragarde Keep|Tiragarde]].  While you're there, think you could find some abandoned [[Kul Tiras (kingdom)|Kul Tiras]] knicknacks?

Thanks sweetie!

;Female character
What're you looking at, ugly?  I've seen you walking around [[Razor Hill]], trying to steal MY men from me!

Listen, I've got something for you to do.  I hear Gar'Thok's got you headed over to Tiragarde.  While you're there, think you could find some abandoned Kul Tiras knicknacks?

Don't ask why, just get to it!

You brought me my treasure!  What a sweetheart!

About time you showed up. Don't even think about stealing that treasure... it's worthless here in [[Kalimdor]], anyhow.
