Find [[the Spirit of Thunder Ridge]] to learn how you can earn the Blessing of the Land.
*Find the Spirit of Thunder Ridge{{Co|40.6|26.76|Durotar}}

==Description==
To earn the blessing of the land, a young [[orc]] must learn respect for the spirits that dwell alongside us. If we do not live in balance with the elements and life around us, it can lead to calamity.

I will call to the spirits, and they will guide us to where your aid is needed. It is up to you to complete the task before you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
Hear me, young one. I am the spirit who protects this place, what your people call "[[Thunder Ridge]]".

The canyon below once teemed with life. It could once more, with your intervention.

Aid me now, and it will benefit [[Thunder lizard|my people]] and yours.

==Notes==
On accept, Aggralan starts channeling magic in her hands.

Head to Thunder Ridge and interact with the [[Ancient Skeleton]] to summon the Spirit of Thunder Ridge in the form of a ball of lightning in one of the skeleton's eye sockets.
