==Objectives==
Clear the pass of boulders, mines, and other obstructions between [[Razor Hill]] and [[Orgrimmar]].
*[[Mine-Bot 5000]] controlled
*Boulders destroyed (7)
*[[Land Mine (Durotar)|Land Mines]] detonated (9)
*Self Destruct to destroy the [[Impassable Boulders]]
*Ride the [[Armored Wyvern|wyvern]] to the front line
*Speak with [[Varok Saurfang]]

==Description==
[[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]'s [[Banshee loyalists|loyalists]] have collapsed part of the canyon path to Orgrimmar. Our forces are now cut off from each other.

We need to reinforce our front line or the Banshee will pick us off at her leisure. We have come too far to be slain by a thousand cuts.

[[Gazlowe]] and [[Tinkmaster Overspark|one]] of the [[Alliance]]'s [[gnome]]s believe they have an answer. You'd best ensure that their plan does not backfire.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Hmm. Maybe that [[goblin]]'s gadgets have some use.

==Completion==
Swift action saved our soldiers' lives, but there is still more to do.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|King Wrynn. May we speak?}}
:{{text|say|[[Anduin Wrynn]]|Of course.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Our sister is patient. She knows we have precious few soldiers left. While we lay siege to Orgrimmar, she will whittle away at our numbers.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|But Sylvanas is not the only threat we face. The [[N'Zoth|Old God]] has been freed. I can hear his whispers... sense his unseen tendrils writhing all around us.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I know, Alleria. What are you suggesting?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Sylvanas commands what may be the only army capable of defeating N'Zoth. For the sake of Azeroth... perhaps we should stand aside and let her.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Your sister will not fight for us, Alleria.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|When Sylvanas realized the war was on the cusp of ending, she lured both fleets into [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]'s hands. Not to find victory, but to meet death.}}
:{{text|say|Varok Saurfang|"In the end, death claims us all." [[Eitrigg]] told me those were among the last words Sylvanas spoke to [[Vol'jin]].}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We cannot wage two wars. Sylvanas must fall. Here. Now. Before all is lost.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|It shall be so, my king. [[Vereesa Windrunner|Vereesa]] and I will scout her line for weaknesses. Good luck... to all of us.}}

The Windrunners depart. Head outside to meet with Gazlowe and [[Tinkmaster Overspark]], who have joined up to upgrade the [[Mine-Bot 5000]] to clear the way through the canyons.

:{{text|say|Gazlowe|So you're the one operatin' this, <name>?}}
:{{text|say|Gazlowe|We've souped up the Mine-Bot 5000 with a few choice improvements.}}
:{{text|say|Tinkmaster Overspark|Improvements made possible by my incredible genius!}}
:{{text|say|Gazlowe|Anyway! This baby should be able to clear out anything in its path. Mines, boulders... and some skulking assassins.}}

:{{Text|emote|Remote control the Mine-Bot 5000 to annihilate the boulders in your way. Use Z.A.P.S. to detonate the mines. Clear the canyon between here and Orgrimmar.}}

Use the nearby Mine-Bot 5000 Control to drive a {{Abilities|Mine-Bot 5000|id=303442|icon=inv_junkertank}} to the boulders blocking the road to Orgrimmar. The Mine-Bot has two abilities: Boulder Annihilation (to break the boulders) and Z.A.P.S. (Zone Appropriate Protection System, to detonate mines and damage [[Loyalist Saboteur]]s on the route). Break 7 boulders and detonate 9 mines. 

:{{Text|emote|Use the Mine-Bot 5000's Self Destruct button to destroy the impassable boulders at the end of the canyon!}}

Once the way is clear, take the Mine-Bot to a set of impassable boulders and activate its Self-Destruct. You will be returned to the controls once this is done.

:{{text|say|Gazlowe|Hey! Would'ya look at that! The way is clear!}}
:{{text|say|Tinkmaster Overspark|Of course it is! Gnomish tinkology never fails!}}
:{{text|say|[[Gila Crosswires]]|The day was saved thanks to Tinkmaster Overspark's unmatched ingenuity!}}
:{{text|say|Gazlowe|Ugh. Whatever. Let's just get to the front.}}

If you happen to go too far away, a debuff will apply and the following text will appear.

:{{Text|emote|You are losing connection to the Mine-Bot 5000. Return to the canyon immediately!}}

Take the nearby [[Armored Wyvern]] (optional) or fly up to the [[Dranosh'ar Blockade]] to meet with Saurfang.
