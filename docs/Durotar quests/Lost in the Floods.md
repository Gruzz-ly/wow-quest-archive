==Objectives==
Use [[:Thonk's Spyglass]] to search for survivors in [[Southfury Watershed]].
*Find [[Raggaran]]
*Find flooded hut
*Find [[Misha Tor'kren|Misha]]
*Find [[Zen'Taji]]
*[[Thonk's Spyglass]] (provided)

==Description==
The recent [[Cataclysm (event)|cataclysmic events]] have done more than wash a few boats onto our shore, <class>. The [[Southfury River]] has overflowed, and [[Durotar]]'s entire western basin is now flooded.

There are still people out there. I've been searching for a while, but haven't been able to find anything. Would you mind using my telescope and taking a look for yourself?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
What have you seen?

==Completion==
I see... so the trick is that you need to put the LITTLE end of the spyglass up to your eye.&nbsp; I'll remember that piece of information.

==Notes== 	
You must use the spyglass four times from the [[Razor Hill Watchtower]]. Each use will trigger a short cutscene. At the end of each cutscene you will get credit for finding one of the objectives; if you cancel the cinematic before it is complete, you will not get quest credit.

==Progression==
