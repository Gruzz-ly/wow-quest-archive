==Objectives==
[[File:Old Cookbook.jpg|thumb|The [[Old Cookbook]].]]
Learn the basics of [[cooking]] and retrieve [[Cook Torka]]'s cookbook.
*[[Spoons and Forks|Old Cookbook]] Collected{{Co|51.65|41.25|Durotar}}
*Cooking Learned

==Description==
I can guide you in crafting your offering to the ancestors, but you will need two things:

First, you need to know the basics! [[Arugi]] here can teach you how to cook if you don't already know.

Second, I need my old cookbook. We're going to make something truly special, a fusion of old [[Draenor]] and [[Azeroth]], and I'm going to need it for reference.

Go fetch my book from the inn, and we can get started.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you find my book? It's somewhere inside the inn.

==Completion==
Ah, here we are. It may not look like much, but this old thing made it through the [[Dark Portal]]!

It's a family heirloom from before the [[Old Horde|Horde]]. Unusual for an orc, I know. My great grandmother, [[Barasha|Cook Barasha]], collected recipes from all the clans at each [[Kosh'harg]]. As I understand it, she didn't trust anyone else to get it right, so she wrote it all down! We have stories of her awesome stubbornness...

Enough reminiscing! Time to get cooking! Hope you're ready, we have some work ahead of us.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Durak|His book is in the inn? Let's go!}}

The "Cooking Learned" objective is automatically completed if the player already knows the [[Cooking]] profession.

Upon entering the inn, Durak leaves the player's side to go inspect one of the beds on the west side of the room.
:{{Text|say|Durak|I'll look over here!}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|Hmm... Not here.}}
:''He walks over to the northwest side of the room.''
:{{Text|say|Durak|No, not here either.}}
:''He walks over to the north side of the room.''
:{{Text|say|Durak|Hmm...}}

The [[Old Cookbook]] is actually lying in a bed on the opposite side of the room. Loot [[Spoons and Forks]] from it.
:{{Text|say|Durak|Oh! You found it? Good work!}}
:''Durak rejoins the player's side.''

On completion, Spoons and Forks appears on Torka's table.

==Progression==
