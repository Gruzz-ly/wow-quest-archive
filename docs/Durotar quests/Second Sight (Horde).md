==Objectives==
Use your [[Spectral Sight]].
* Spectral Sight used

==Description==
[[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] becoming [[Warchief]] may be problematic. In life she was a proud [[elven ranger|ranger]], known to many in [[Illidari|our ranks]]. But since the [[Scourge]] took her, some of her own allies do not trust the Banshee Queen.

The [[Burning Legion|Legion]] will strike at the first hint of dissension.

Even now, I sense something amiss, <name>. I fear that not all is as it seems.

Quickly, use your Spectral Sight. We must know if there are foes among us!

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|11|60}}

==Progress==
Time is precious.

==Completion==
Of course the Legion would try to infiltrate this funeral. With the leaders of the Horde gathered in one place at one time, it was too tasty of a target for the demons to resist.

==Notes==
Use Second sight anywhere in the area: demons are hiding everywhere!
