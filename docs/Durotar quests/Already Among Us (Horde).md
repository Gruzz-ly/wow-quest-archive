==Objectives==
Slay 10 [[Suspicious Technician]]s or [[Loyalist Assassin]]s.
*Loyalist combatants slain (10)

==Description==
[[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] still commands the loyalty of many within the Horde. The war she started has blinded them with rage and hatred. She exploits that to maintain her support.

<Saurfang scowls.>

They do not yet see she will lead us to ruin, that her so-called victories are all hollow.

Some of her agents have been spotted lurking within our ranks. Kill them. They will show us no mercy, and will have none in return.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You're alive. I imagine that many of Sylvanas's loyalists are not.

==Completion==
We both have blood on our hands. Today, we will see that it has not been in vain.

==Notes==
The technicians (either orc, goblin, or Forsaken) are around the siege engines in the staging area, while the assassins (all Forsaken) can appear at random. The technicians will be provoked if you are also working on removing the suspicious crates for [[Saving the Siege (Horde)]].

==Progression==
{{Breaking the Cycle Horde}}

==Patch changes==
