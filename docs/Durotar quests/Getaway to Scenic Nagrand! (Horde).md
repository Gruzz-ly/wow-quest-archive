==Objectives==
Take the [[Scenic Getaway Portal]] to [[Nagrand]], then take pictures of wildlife for [[Karn Goreshot|Karn]].
*Portal taken to Nagrand (Optional)
*[[Toothy (clefthoof)|Toothy]]'s grin photographed
*[[Soaring Windroc]] photographed
*[[Great White Elekk]] photographed
*[[Swifthorn the Timid]] photographed
*Photographs delivered to Karn
*Take the return portal to Orgrimmar (Optional)
*Photographs given to [[Laverne Cameron|Laverne]]
*[[Borrowed Camera]] (provided)

==Description==
Good morrow! Today's special portal is a magical getaway to the great plains of Nagrand!

Would you, perchance, be interested in a proposition? I will lend you my camera if you could deliver any photographs you take to my dear friend Karn.

He has been adrift in Nagrand as of late, lost in his own thoughts. As stubborn as he is, I'm sure he will appreciate the company. I would do it myself, but I must maintain the portals here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
How is Karn? When last I saw him, he seemed drowned in regrets and loneliness.

==Completion==
He asked you to do WHAT?

He knows that Laverne is--ARGGH! This is my justice, I suppose, for not acting sooner on matters of my own heart.

No matter. Everything is fine, Aurora, this is fine...

Erm, thank you regardless, <name>. The thorns of my roses need not rest in your hands. I will find another way to gain Laverne's attention.

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Scenic Getaway Portal]] and choose the Nagrand option:
:{{Gossip|quest=|A wild adventure in Nagrand.}}

{{Zone Map|zone=Nagrand|notes=

Find Toothy at {{Co|52.81|44.84|Nagrand}}. He comes under attack from [[Big Game Hunter (mob)|Big Game Hunters]]. Defeat them, then use the camera and take a photo of the beast.
:{{text|say|Big Game Hunter|You ain't grinning now, are ye beasty?}}
:{{text|say|Toothy|<Angry grunting.>}}
:{{text|say|Big Game Hunter|Stay out of our business, damn photographer!}}

Swifthorn the Timid is found running around {{Co|49.46|38.72|Nagrand}} with two [[Amateur Photographer]]s wheezing for breath, trying to keep up.
:{{text|say|Amateur Photographer|Wait, come back!}}
:{{text|emote|Amateur Photographer wheezes for breath.}}

Soaring Windrocs are flying above [[Lake Sunspring]].

Great White Elekk is found northeast of [[Oshu'gun]] at {{Co|42.96|59.81|Nagrand}}. Taking a photo of it enrages it:
:{{Text|emote|Great White Elekk is startled by the flash photography!}}

Nearby are [[Amateur Photographer]]s:
:{{text|say|Amateur Photographer|How do we get a picture of THAT? It's terrifying!}}
:{{text|say|Amateur Photographer|I don't want to scare it! You go first!}}

Once all four photos are taken, head to [[Karn Goreshot]] at {{Co|37.60|43.82|Nagrand}}
:{{Gossip|quest=|I took these photographs for you.}}
::Photographs for me?

::<Karn inspects your pictures.>

::Wow! To think, I spent my entire life killing these creatures. In only a few photographs, you have captured their grace and majesty in a way I have never seen.

::Thank you, <name>, for this honorable gift. But I must ask you to pass them to someone else.

::I met a woman at the Gala of Gifts this week--[[Laverne Cameron|Laverne]] was her name. She mentioned being an artist interested in the poses of animals.

::Please, take these to her. Let these inspire her as they have inspired me.

There is a Portal to Orgrimmar at {{Co|49.69|46.27|Nagrand}} that teleports the adventurer back to the gala. Speak with Laverne:
:{{Gossip|quest=|Karn wanted me to share these photographs with you.}}
::These are incredible! You have my gratitude, adventurer.

::Karn is such a sweet man. Perhaps I will seek him out when this show has finished...
