==Objectives==
Remove 8 Suspicious Crates.
*[[Suspicious Crate (Durotar)|Suspicious Crates]] removed (8)

==Description==
The [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Banshee]]'s [[Spy|spies]] were able to sneak past our guards in the chaos of the rockslides. They've been planting bombs on our siege weaponry.

Get rid of those bombs.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You look mostly intact. I take it you removed the bombs successfully, then?

==Completion==
Well done. We cannot afford to lose any more of our weaponry to Sylvanas's treachery.

==Notes==
The crates are scattered around the staging area next to Alliance and Horde siege engines. Removing them may also provoke nearby [[Suspicious Technician]]s (objectives for the concurrent quest [[Already Among Us (Horde)]]).

==Progression==
{{Breaking the Cycle Horde}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 8.2.5|note=Added.}}
