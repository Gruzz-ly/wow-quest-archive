This quest is available during the [[Brewfest]] event.

==Objectives==
Get a keg from [[Flynn Firebrew]] in [[Kharanos]] and return it to [[Pol Amberstill]].  If you lose your ram, ask [[Neill Ramstein]] for another.
*Kegs Delivered (3)

==Description==
So you want to help out at [[Brewfest]]?  I've got the perfect task for ya.  I'll put you on one of my racing rams and you head down to Kharanos.  I've got some kegs I need to pick up.

Flynn Firebrew is waiting on a hill near a stack of kegs.  He'll toss you a keg when you get near, then you run the keg back here and toss the keg to Pol Amberstill.  You can only carry one at a time.

Ready?

==Rewards==
You will receive: [[Brewfest Prize Token]] (10)

==Progress==
I need those kegs!  So, what are yeh waitin' for!?!

==Completion==
Thanks a lot for your help!  As long as Brewfest is going and the [[Dark Iron dwarf|Dark Iron dwarves]] are attacking, I'll need some help shipping kegs.  So if you want to work for more tokens, talk to me every day.

But enough about that, I need to pay you for the job you just did.  Here are your tokens, have fun at Brewfest!

==Notes==
See the [[Brewfest#Racing Ram Tips|Racing Ram Tips]] on the [[Brewfest]] page.

Completing the quest will unlock the daily version, [[Brew For Brewfest]]. You will have 4 minutes to complete as many runs as possible, each run giving you 2 prize tokens and adding 30 seconds to the buff timer of the ram. It is possible to keep your ram on "red" during the entire time, make sure you pass by each apple basket (for Alliance it is easiest to just hit the one at the sign post and the one back in Kharanos, just past the barrels of that yummy booze).
