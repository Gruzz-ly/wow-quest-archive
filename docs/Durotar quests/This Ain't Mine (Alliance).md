==Objectives==
Clear the pass of boulders, mines, and other obstructions between [[Razor Hill]] and [[Orgrimmar]].
* [[Mine-Bot 5000]] controlled
* Boulders destroyed (7)
* [[Land Mine (Durotar)|Land Mines]] detonated (9)
* Self Destruct to destroy the [[Impassable Boulders]]
* Ride the [[Wildhammer Gryphon (Durotar)|gryphon]] to the front line
* Speak with [[Anduin Wrynn]]

==Description==
Your arrival is timely, <name>. [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]'s [[Banshee loyalists|loyalists]] have collapsed part of the canyon path to [[Orgrimmar]].

We are cut off from our vanguard and I fear that they will be destroyed if we cannot reinforce them quickly. Our forces are few in number. We cannot afford to leave them stranded for long.

[[Tinkmaster Overspark]] and [[Gazlowe]] believe they have a solution. Hurry and aid them however you can.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Thank the Light you were able to open the pass.

==Completion==
We may have rejoined the vanguard, but Sylvanas's forces have been harrying our front line.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|[[Alleria Windrunner]]|King Wrynn. May we speak?}}
:{{text|say|[[Anduin Wrynn]]|Of course.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Our sister is patient. She knows we have precious few soldiers left. While we lay siege to Orgrimmar, she will whittle away at our numbers.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|But Sylvanas is not the only threat we face. The [[N'Zoth|Old God]] has been freed. I can hear his whispers... sense his unseen tendrils writhing all around us.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|I know, Alleria. What are you suggesting?}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|Sylvanas commands what may be the only army capable of defeating N'Zoth. For the sake of Azeroth... perhaps we should stand aside and let her.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Your sister will not fight for us, Alleria.}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|When Sylvanas realized the war was on the cusp of ending, she lured both fleets into [[Queen Azshara|Azshara]]'s hands. Not to find victory, but to meet death.}}
:{{text|say|Varok Saurfang|"In the end, death claims us all." [[Eitrigg]] told me those were among the last words Sylvanas spoke to [[Vol'jin]].}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|We cannot wage two wars. Sylvanas must fall. Here. Now. Before all is lost.}}
:{{text|say|Alleria Windrunner|It shall be so, my king. [[Vereesa Windrunner|Vereesa]] and I will scout her line for weaknesses. Good luck... to all of us.}}
:''The Windrunners depart.''

Head outside to meet with Gazlowe and [[Tinkmaster Overspark]], who have teamed up to upgrade the [[Mine-Bot 5000]] to clear the way through the canyons.

:{{text|say|Tinkmaster Overspark|Ah! <Name>! You are the perfect candidate to control this magnificent application of tinkology!}}
:{{text|say|Gazlowe|We've souped up the Mine-Bot 5000 with a few choice improvements.}}
:{{text|say|Tinkmaster Overspark|Improvements made possible by my incredible genius!}}
:{{text|say|Gazlowe|Anyway! This baby should be able to clear out anything in its path. Mines, boulders... and some skulking assassins.}}

Interact with the control console.

:{{Text|emote|Remote control the Mine-Bot 5000 to annihilate the boulders in your way. Use Z.A.P.S. to detonate the mines. Clear the canyon between here and Orgrimmar.}}

Use the nearby Mine-Bot 5000 Control to drive a {{Abilities|Mine-Bot 5000|id=303442|icon=inv_junkertank}} to the boulders blocking the road to Orgrimmar. The Mine-Bot has two abilities: Boulder Annihilation (to break the boulders) and Z.A.P.S. (Zone Appropriate Protection System, to detonate mines and damage [[Loyalist Saboteur]]s on the route). Break 7 boulders and detonate 9 mines. 

:{{Text|emote|Use the Mine-Bot 5000's Self Destruct button to destroy the impassable boulders at the end of the canyon!}}

Once the way is clear, take the Mine-Bot to a set of impassable boulders and activate its Self-Destruct. You will be returned to the controls once this is done.

:{{text|say|Gazlowe|Hey! Would'ya look at that! The way is clear!}}
:{{text|say|Tinkmaster Overspark|Of course it is! Gnomish tinkology never fails!}}
:{{text|say|[[Gila Crosswires]]|The day was saved thanks to Tinkmaster Overspark's unmatched ingenuity!}}
:{{text|say|Gazlowe|Ugh. Whatever. Let's just get to the front.}}

If you happen to go too far away, a debuff will apply and the following text will appear.

:{{Text|emote|You are losing connection to the Mine-Bot 5000. Return to the canyon immediately!}}

Take the nearby [[Armored Wyvern]] (optional) or fly up to the [[Dranosh'ar Blockade]] to meet with Anduin.
