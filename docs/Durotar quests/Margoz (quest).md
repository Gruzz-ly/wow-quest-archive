== Objectives ==
Speak with [[Margoz]].

== Description ==
One of our more useful [[shaman]], Margoz, knows more of the [[Burning Blade]]'s corruption. He speaks of a cave called [[Skull Rock]] in the mountains, just outside [[Orgrimmar]], that shelters a large band of Burning Blade cultists.

Before you go to Skull Rock, speak with Margoz. He is wise and his council is valued.

He is camped to the southeast, between the coast and [[Drygulch Ravine]].

Follow his advice, but whatever Margoz says, <name>, I still want you to crush those cultists! 

== Completion ==
Welcome, <name>.  Word reached me of your coming, and of your exploits in [[Durotar]].

You are a <class> of growing skill and renown.

Stay on the pure path, and your future will be great indeed.

==Notes==
Margoz{{co|56.5|20.1|Durotar}} stands at a small Horde encampment east of the [[The Dranosh'ar Blockade]].

A short optional quest chain can be started by speaking to [[Vek'nag]], who is pacing next to Margoz's camp. He starts [[Sent for Help]].
