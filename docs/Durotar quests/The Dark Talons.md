==Objectives==
Deliver the [[Scalecommander Cindrethresh|Scalecommander]]'s orders to Kodethi and the [[Dark Talons]].
*Orders delivered to [[Kodethi]]
*Meet Naleidea at the zeppelin tower outside Orgrimmar.

==Description==
;Non-dracthyr
[[Naleidea Rivergleam|Naleidea]] is enthusiastic, but she's a historian, not a [[soldier]]. She knows nothing of the dangers we'll face in the [[Dragon Isles]].

Not that anyone needs to worry. After all, the Dark Talons will be protecting the expedition.

I'm going to discuss mission logistics with [[Ebyssian]] and your [[Horde]] leaders.

My [[lieutenant]], Kodethi, is exploring the city along with the other [[dracthyr]]. Be a good soldier and let him know we are going to rally at the [[zeppelin tower]]. He'll relay my orders to the others.

;Dracthyr
Naleidea seems enthusiastic, but she's a historian, not a soldier like us. She knows nothing of the dangers we will face in the Dragon Isles.

Not that the Horde needs to worry. After all, we Dark Talons will be protecting the expedition.

I'm going to discuss mission logistics with Ebyssian and these Horde leaders.

Kodethi is exploring the city along with the others. Tell him to rally at the zeppelin tower. I'll meet you there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*{{Cost|25|74}}
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you suspect that a dracthyr could outpace a boat over the entire trip to the Dragon Isles? Exhaustion would take its toll, surely?

==Completion==
I am pleased to have the dracthyr accompanying us on the expedition.

Their unique perspective should prove valuable, and learning more of their own history will help them come to terms with their current circumstances.

As I've said before, history heals every wound.

==Notes==
During the [[Tempest Unleashed]] event, this quest was available at level 10.

At the [[Dranosh'ar Blockade]]{{Co|54.14|10.10|Durotar}}, Kodethi is overseeing the training of [[Dracthyr Evoker]]s, while several [[Orgrimmar Grunt]]s cheer at them.

:Welcome to our makeshift training arena, friend.

:I trust we are not disturbing anyone up here? I was assured that this area was available today and that sparring was permitted.

:{{Gossip|Scalecommander Cindrethresh would like you to meet her at the zeppelin tower.}}

:{{Text|say|Kodethi|The odds favor us!}}
:''Kodethi and the trainees fly toward the zeppelin tower.''

;Approaching Naleidea
:{{Text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|You made quick work of gathering our expedition members. I admire efficiency in my traveling companions.}}

;Upon completion
:''A mage portal suddenly appears near Ebyssian, and [[Archmage Khadgar]] jumps out of it.''
:{{Text|say|Naleidea Rivergleam|A surprise attack! Guards! Arrest this handsome wizard!}}
:{{Text|say|Ebyssian|Be at ease. He is an ally.}}
:{{Text|say|Archmage Khadgar|Apologies for my abrupt arrival. But the news I bring cannot wait for pleasantries.}}

==Progression==
{{The Dragon Isles Await}}
