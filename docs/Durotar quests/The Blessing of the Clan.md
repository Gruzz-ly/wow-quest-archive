==Objectives==
Choose a clan to champion during your [[om'gora]].
*Clan Chosen

==Description==
To earn the blessing of the clan, a young [[orc]] must learn that the clan is only as strong as its members. Prove your strength, and worth, to the living orcs.

Since you were not born into a clan, you must first choose a clan to champion, and be accepted by the clan's chieftain.

The chieftains have gathered in [[Razor Hill Barracks|the barracks]]. Join a clan, and complete the task given to you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
The clan representatives are inside the barracks. You must choose one to join.

==Completion==
Your path has been chosen. Are you ready to proceed?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Farseer Aggralan|The clans come together anew. Choose a clan to champion in your om'gora.}}

[[Thrall]], [[Eitrigg]], [[Jorin Deadeye]], [[Gorgonna]], [[Gorfax Angerfang]], and [[Thega Graveblade]] are standing inside the Razor Hill Barracks. Speak to any of the chieftains to join that clan. This choice is purely cosmetic: the only things that change are the quest giver and quest text in the following quest, [[The Long Knives]], and the visual effect of the [[Clan Banner]] toy rewarded later in the chain. The latter can be freely changed by speaking to [[Envoy Korg]] after the questline is completed.

After choosing a clan to join, the player is given a "Are you sure you wish to join this clan?" message to confirm the choice, after which the chieftain walks out of the Barracks to resume their previous position next to Aggralan while the other chieftains remain standing inside.

;Thrall - [[Frostwolf clan]]
:You wish to learn more about the Frostwolves?
:The Frostwolf clan originally hailed from [[Blade's Edge Mountains|Frostfire Ridge]] on [[Draenor]]. On [[Azeroth]], most of us now dwell in the [[Alterac Mountains]]. We are known for having life-long [[frost wolf|wolf]] companions, being hardy warriors and hunters, and having a strong connection to the spirits of the elements and our ancestors.
:We value honor above all else, and strive to do what is right. I am sure you are familiar with the story of my father, [[Durotan]]. He fought for the freedom of our people.
:If you would like to formally join the Frostwolves, we would be honored to have you, <name>.
:{{Gossip|I wish to join the Frostwolf clan.}}
::{{Text|say|Thrall|Excellent! Come, let us return to Aggra for your task.}}

;Eitrigg - [[Blackrock clan]]
:You wish to learn more about the Blackrock?
:We originally hailed from [[Blade's Edge Mountains|Gorgrond]] on Draenor, and then found our home in [[Blackrock Mountain]] after [[First War|the invasion]]. Our chieftain, [[Blackhand]], was the first [[Warchief]] of the [[Old Horde|Horde]]. He was cruel and hungry for power, and was overthrown by [[Orgrim Doomhammer]], which split our clan's loyalties.
:Those of us that remain true Blackrock orcs value strength of body and purpose. Many of us are warriors and blacksmiths. [[Varok Saurfang]] and his brother, [[Broxigar]], were of the Blackrock clan. Even though both are gone, we still strive to live our lives to their standard of heroism and sacrifice.
:I would be honored to have you join us, <name>.
:{{Gossip|I wish to join the Blackrock clan.}}
::{{Text|say|Eitrigg|You honor me, <name>. Come, we must return to Aggra for your task.}}

;Jorin Deadeye - [[Bleeding Hollow clan]]
:You wish to learn of the Bleeding Hollow Clan{{Sic}}? As you wish.
:Before the time of the Horde, we lived in the wilds of the [[Hellfire Peninsula|Tanaan Jungle]]. My father, [[Kilrogg Deadeye]], led most of our clan to war in Azeroth. Those who did not return to Draenor after the [[Second War]] were captured and placed in [[internment camp]]s. These two halves of my clan have been separated, until now.
:My clan is known for performing rituals that many would consider... dark. We do not shy away from such tools. We know what fate has in store for us, and do what we must to survive.
:You have performed mighty deeds and been victorious in many battles, <name>. The Bleeding Hollow would gladly accept you.
:{{Gossip|I wish to join the Bleeding Hollow clan.}}
::{{Text|say|Jorin Deadeye|Hmm. Perhaps I underestimated you, <name>. Come, we must speak to the Farseer.}}

;Gorgonna - [[Warsong clan]]
:Greetings, <name>! You wish to learn of my clan?
:The Warsong clan hails from the plains of [[Nagrand]] on Draenor. The mighty [[Grommash Hellscream]] led the clan to Azeroth in the Horde's vanguard. Despite their defeat in the Second War, most of the clan evaded capture. They later rallied to Thrall's side to free those in the internment camps, and build a new home.
:Lok-tar ogar! It defines the Warsong. We value skill on the battlefield above all, and are known for our fearsome battle cries. Despite this, we have learned the lessons of the past. We will never again sacrifice our honor to achieve victory. The fall of [[Garrosh Hellscream]] has ensured that.
:I would be honored to fight by your side as Warsong, <name>.
:{{Gossip|I did not know you were from the Warsong clan.}} ''(Produces the same dialogue as [[The Kosh'harg#Dialogue|earlier in the questline]].)''
:{{Gossip|I wish to join the Warsong clan.}}
::{{Text|say|Gorgonna|Glad to hear it, <name>! Come, let us speak to the Farseer about your task.}}

;Gorfax Angerfang - [[Dragonmaw clan]]
:You want to know about the Dragonmaw? Hmph, fine. I will recount our sad history.
:My clan were once fearsome hunters and [[rylak]]-riders who lived on the border of Frostfire Ridge and Gorgrond. We earned the name Dragonmaw after we were given [[Demon Soul|the power]] to enslave [[red dragon]]s by [[Deathwing]].
:After we lost our dragons, we grew isolated and desperate. We attempted to find new slaves, the [[Netherwing]], and the [[black dragon]]s, but could keep neither. We eventually joined Hellscream's Horde, only to lose [[Warlord Zaela|another leader]]--and any scrap of honor we had left.
:If after hearing all of this you still wish to join the Dragonmaw, we will welcome you.
:{{Gossip|I wish to join the Dragonmaw clan.}}
::{{Text|say|Gorfax Angerfang|If that is your wish. Come, we must speak to the Farseer.}}
:{{Gossip|The Dragonmaw are dishonorable. Why should I join you?}}
::You are not wrong. The [[Angerfang]] were long supporters of [[Nekros Skullcrusher|Nek'ros Skullcrusher]]{{Sic}} and [[Nek'rosh Skullcrusher|his son]]. It earned us nothing but death and dishonor.
::I will say this. I intend to find a new place in Azeroth--and in this new Horde--for my people. And I intend to do it through our own strength alone, not through yet another enslaved people.
::If we Dragonmaw die out before that happens, so be it.
::{{Gossip|I wish to join the Dragonmaw clan.}}

;Thega Graveblade - [[Shattered Hand clan]]
:You come to learn the ways of the Shattered Hand? I can tell you, but then I'll have to kill you.
:Just kidding.
:Long ago, our clan dwelled in the [[Spires of Arak]] on Draenor. Our founders were comprised of a group of gladiator slaves who escaped from the [[Highmaul]] [[ogre]]s. The clan name comes from a tradition of cutting off one of your hands, and replacing it with a weapon.
:...that is no longer a requirement.
:These days, we serve as Orgrimmar's spies and assassins. We value ruthlessness, cunning, and the nerve to do what must be done to ensure peace for the rest of our people.
:We have watched your many deeds from the shadows, <name>, and would welcome you into our fold with pleasure.
:{{Gossip|I wish to join the Shattered Hand clan.}}
::{{Text|say|Thega Graveblade|Good choice, <name>. Come, we must discuss your task with the Farseer.}}
:{{Gossip|What happened to [[Gordul]]? I thought he led the Shattered Hand.}}
::He has been usurped. It is our way that the strongest must lead.
::Don't worry, I didn't kill him. He is here at the [[Kosh'harg]] if you wish to visit.
::{{Gossip|I wish to join the Shattered Hand clan.}}

During this quest, players can also talk to [[Lantresor of the Blade]] outside the Barracks about joining the [[Burning Blade clan]], but this is not a valid option to join:
:So this is Azeroth, and this is the "New Horde", hm? The orcs have made a decent home for themselves here.
:It appears there is even room for us half-breeds at this new Kosh'harg. I see [[Garona Halforcen|Garona]], and the [[Mok'nathal]].
:I hope [[Blackhand]] is rolling in his grave.
:{{Gossip|Can I join the Burning Blade clan?}}
:No.
:<He notices you are waiting for an explanation and groans.>
:All but a few of the dishonorable Burning Blade are dead, fel-corrupted, or traitors, both here and on [[Outland]].
:They do not deserve your loyalty. As far as I can tell, I am leader of this accursed clan by surviving the longest, and I say that it should wither and die. That is my final word on the matter.

After a clan has been picked, the other chieftains revert to their previous gossip text, with the exception of Eitrigg who gains a slightly different set:
:It warms my heart for so many of us to be together again, and not to march off to war!

As does Thrall:
:So many answered our call to join the Kosh'harg! It is good to see everyone again.
