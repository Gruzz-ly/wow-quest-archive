==Objectives==
Assist [[Overlord Geya'rah|Geya'rah]] against the Tyranny of the Light.

*"Tyranny of the Light" scenario completed

==Description==
If it is not an uprising of ogres or the promise of starvation, it's the constant threat of the [[Lightbound]].

Should the reports prove true, this is the closest they have dared approach our stronghold in quite some time.

Come or stay, but make your decision quickly.

==Completion==
To think of those we just lost... It is... No, it is of no use.

==Notes==
Accepting this quest begins the "Tyranny of the Light" scenario.

:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Lantresor! Report!}}
:{{text|say|Lantresor of the Blade|We are holding the line, overlord. But the enemy looks to be mustering for a bigger attack.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|This is not your fight, outsiders. You are free to return to [[Azeroth]].}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|I have never walked away from a battle. I do not plan to start today.}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Then we fight for blood and honor together! With me, heroes!}}

Engage the Lightbound forces at [[Razorbloom Fallow]].
*{{text|say|Overlord Gey'arah|Take out those siege engines!}}
*{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Hold your ground! This land belongs to the Mag'har!}}
*{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Back, draenei! Your Light is not welcome here!}}
*{{text|say|Overlord Gey'arah|Strike down the Light's corruption!}}

===Evermorn Hold===
*Description: Track down {{Au|Exarch Orelis}} at [[Evermorn Hold]].
*Look for Exarch Orelis in Evermorn Hold

Travel to Evermorn Hold.

===Exarch Orelis===
*Description: Defeat Exarch Orelis.
*Exarch Orelis slain

Upon entering Evermorn Hold, a [[Radiant Naaru]] materializes above the field.

:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|No... a naaru... Not again!}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Curse this vile [[Light]]!}}

The naaru unleashes a wave of Light that stuns the {{Au|Mag'har}} in the hold (they gain the Blessing of Eternity buff), just as Exarch Orelis lands in his [[warframe]].

:{{text|say|Exarch Orelis|Cease this pointless defiance, Mag'har! Stand down and welcome the Light!}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Retreat while you still can! You will not force your doctrines upon us, [[draenei]]!}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Orelis|The High Exarch orders you to submit... or face judgment!}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|For {{Au|Draenor}}! For the Mag'har!}}

Orelis becomes hostile. Destroy his warframe.

:{{text|say|Exarch Orelis|The naaru offer us peace and order!}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|You mean subjugation!}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Orelis|Give up your hate! The Light can heal the scars of war!}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Our scars are not yours to take!}}
:{{text|say|Exarch Orelis|This once-fertile land is now lifeless dust. That's what your hate has done!}}

After his warframe falls, Orelis himself jumps out and continues the fight. Kill him. Orelis drops [[Sermon of the High Exarch]] upon his death.

:{{text|say|Exarch Orelis|[[Yrel]]... I have failed you...}}

===Report to the Warchief===
*Description: Return to {{Au|Grommash Hellscream}} at Beastwatch.
*Meet with Grommash

:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Your High Exarch cannot save you. My people will never stop fighting until Draenor is free!}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Come, champions of Azeroth. We must tell the warchief of our victory...}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|And, of the fate of my brothers and sisters in Evermorn Hold. I am afraid there is little we can do to save them now.}}

Return to Beastwatch.

===Orders from Grommash===
*Description: Await orders from Grommash.
*Await orders from the Warchief

:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|The draenei attack was thwarted, warchief. But the High Exarch will not relent. Fanatics never do.}}
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|We will be ready. And what of these heroes from Azeroth? Were they of aid to you?}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|They fought with courage. I admit... I judged you harshly, Eitrigg. You as well, <name>.}}
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|Now, on the matter of the debt we owe your Horde, we will send--}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Me. Along with a company of volunteers. With your permission, warchief.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|You, overlord? But what of your people's fight here?}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|The warchief can hold off the draenei and those traitorous Lightbound. The Mag'har will help you win your war, and then our debt will be paid.}}
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|I suspected that once you bonded with them in battle, you would wish to join these heroes, Geya'rah. I give you my blessing.}}
:{{text|say|Eitrigg|You have our thanks. <name>, prepare to return to--}}

At that moment, Lantresor rides up.

:{{text|say|Lantresor of the Blade|Warchief Hellscream! An army approaches!}}
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|How many do we face, Lantresor?}}
:{{text|say|Lantresor of the Blade|All of them.}}
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|All?}}
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|...}}

===Defense at Beastwatch Tower===
*Description: Use the turret at the top of Beastwatch Tower to defend the Mag'har.
*Use the turret at the top of Beastwatch Tower to defend the Mag'har (0/100%)

:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|Lantresor, ride as hard as you can! Gather every orc you see and bring them here!}}
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|Overlord, Eitrigg, hold the line here with me!}}
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|<Name>, head to the top of the tower and rain hell upon the Lightbound!}}

Go to the top of the tower and man the [[Mag'har Turret]]. It has two abilities: Turret Blast (standard cannon shots) and Iron Lightseeker (fires an [[iron star]]). Use them both upon the [[Lightbound Vigilant]]s and [[Lightbound Soldier]]s.

===Return to the Warchief===
*Description: Return to Warchief Hellscream at Beastwatch.
*Report to the Warchief and await further orders

Head down from the tower and back to Grommash, who has assembled an army of orcs, ogres, and cannon-equipped [[gronn]].

:{{text|yell|Grommash Hellscream|They are too many! We cannot hold this line forever!}}
:{{text|yell|Overlord Geya'rah|We must! It is NOT our fate to fall to this corruption!}}

From the Lightbound lines, [[Yrel|High Exarch Yrel]] calls out.

:{{text|yell|High Exarch Yrel|Grommash Hellscream. It has been a long time.}}
:{{text|yell|Grommash Hellscream|High Exarch. A rare... honor.}}
:{{text|yell|High Exarch Yrel|I have come to offer you one last chance to embrace the Light.}}
:{{text|yell|High Exarch Yrel|Your people are choking the life from this world... dooming the land to desiccation.}}
:{{text|yell|Grommash Hellscream|How can you be so blind, Yrel? It is the Light that has doomed this world!}}
:{{text|yell|High Exarch Yrel|It pains me to lose an old friend, Grommash. But... very well. We will settle this your way.}}
:{{text|emote|<Grommash lowers his voice so only the Mag'har can hear.>}}
:{{text|say|Grommash Hellscream|Geya'rah, get everyone out of here. Now. No questions.}}
:{{text|yell|Grommash Hellscream|For the Mag'har! For Draenor! Lok-tar ogar!}}

===Narrow Escape===
*Description: Escape from Draenor with Eitrigg and the Mag'har.
*Escape from {{Au|Draenor}}

Grommash and Lantresor charge the Lightbound lines. [[Eitrigg]] prepares to activate the shard of the [[:Vision of Time]].

:{{text|yell|Eitrigg|Gather round quickly! We have only one chance!}}
:{{text|yell|Overlord Geya'rah|No! I will stand with my Warchief!}}
:{{text|yell|Eitrigg|Do not let his sacrifice be in vain! We go! NOW!}}
:{{text|say|Overlord Geya'rah|Die well, Grommash Hellscream.}}

There the scenario ends, and the survivors - orcs, ogres and gronn alike - materialize at [[Rocktusk Farm]] outside of [[Orgrimmar]]. Behind the group, [[botani]] and [[saberon]] can be seen running southwest into the [[Northern Barrens]], and [[goren]] south into [[Durotar]]. Turn in to Geya'rah.
