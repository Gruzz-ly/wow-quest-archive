==Objectives==
Slay 10 [[Suspicious Technician]]s or [[Loyalist Assassin]]s.
* [[Banshee loyalists|Loyalist]] combatants slain (10)

==Description==
While some of the [[Horde]] have joined forces with us, many within [[Orgrimmar]] remain loyal to [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]. Her saboteurs have infiltrated our ranks and are posing as our [[technician]]s. Her [[assassin]]s are lurking in the shadows.

Stop any loyalists you encounter, before they can cause any harm.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We have already lost so many in this war. I pray we are able to stem the tide.

==Completion==
I wish this bloodshed wasn't necessary.

==Notes==
The technicians (either orc, goblin, or Forsaken) are around the siege engines in the staging area, while the assassins (all Forsaken) can appear at random. The technicians will be provoked if you are also working on removing the suspicious crates for [[Saving the Siege (Horde)]].

==Progression==
{{Breaking the Cycle Alliance}}

==Patch changes==
