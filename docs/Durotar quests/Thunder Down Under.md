==Objectives==
Attach a Mageweave Tether to 8 Drowned Thunder Lizards in [[Thunder Ridge]].
* Drowned Thunder Lizard removed (8)
* [[Mageweave Tether]] (provided)

==Description==
Our army needs water, and luckily the elements gave us plenty of that when the [[Cataclysm (event)|cataclysm]] hit. The water that filled up the canyon to the southwest should do the trick.

Unfortunately, the corpses of [[thunder lizard]]s still sit at the bottom of the canyon, and their electrical discharges are a bit too dangerous. I've got grunts that can lift them out of the water, but we need someone agile enough to attach the other end of the rope. Are you my <man/woman>, <name>?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}

==Progress==
I need that canyon clean, <name>. Water is normally scarce in Durotar... we should take advantage of this.

==Completion==
The electricity was only one of the dangers. If those carcasses rot too long under the water, that entire source becomes undrinkable.

Well done, <class>.

==Notes==
The water breathing spell given for this quest is also useful for the quest [[Fizzled]], so the two are best done together.

The Drowned Thunder Lizards periodically discharges and stuns you if you're close, so time it carefully!

To reach Thunder Ridge, exit the area around the hut and take the path going west. Go past [[Rocktusk Farm]]. There will be a group of cacti south of the road. Past this is Thunder Ridge. There are many Thunder Lizards are under the water.
