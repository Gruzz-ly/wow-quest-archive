==Objectives==
Bring Grimtak's Meats to [[Burok]] in [[Razor Hill]].
* [[Grimtak's Meats]] (provided)

==Description==
I have some choice cuts of meat that I want to send to a friend. Her name is [[Gryshka]], the [[innkeeper]] in [[Orgrimmar]]. Will you deliver the meat for me?

The fastest way to Orgrimmar is on a [[Wyvern|wind rider]]. Take the meats to the Razor Hill wind rider master, Burok, and speak with him about transport to Orgrimmar.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 50 [[XP]]
* +25 reputation with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
* +25 reputation with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
You need to get somewhere fast?  Then you're talking to the right orc!

==Completion==
You have to get this meat to Orgrimmar?  That is no problem.  For a small fee, my wind rider can take you there.
