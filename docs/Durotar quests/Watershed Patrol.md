==Objectives==
Search the Southfury Watershed and help the people you saw in the spyglass.

*Help [[Raggaran]]
*Help [[Misha Tor'kren]]
*Help [[Zen'Taji]]

==Description==
My post is here on the tower, <name>, and I cannot leave it.  I need someone to go out there and help the people who are still trapped in the river's overflow.

Can I count on you?

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{coppercost|450}} (or {{coppercost|540}} at max level)

==Progress==
How goes your journey, <class>?

==Completion==
I used that trick you taught me with the spyglass, and I watched you running around down there.  Quite impressive!

How'd you make the old woman fly, by the way?

==Notes==
In order to help these people you have to go to each of them and do their quests. The easiest way to go about this is to first go to [[Misha Tor'kren]] at {{coords|43.4|40.6|Durotar}} and pick up [[Lost But Not Forgotten (Durotar)]]. On your way to [[Raggaran]]{{coords|42.6|49.8|Durotar}},
kill crocolisks for their teeth. Pick up his quests, kill quilboars around him and then move towards [[Zen'Taji]]{{coords|35.8|41.4|Durotar}}, if you haven't hit 250 crocolisk teeth, continue killing crocolisks. Do Zen'Taji's two quests, then turn in Misha's quest, and head back to [[Thonk]].

The quest text has not been updated since the removal of the requirement to help [[Grandmatron Tekla]] in [[Spirits Be Praised]]. Due to this, the completion text "How'd you make the old woman fly, by the way?" no longer makes sense, and even the opening text tells you to help all the people you saw through the spyglass, which would include Grandmatron Tekla, as [[Lost in the Floods]] was also not updated.
