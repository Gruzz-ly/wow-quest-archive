==Objectives==
Speak with [[Allari the Souleater]].

==Description==
As if things weren't unsettled enough, guests have arrived... the [[Illidari]].

These [[demon hunter]]s have been imprisoned since their [[Illidan Stormrage|master]]'s fall at the [[Black Temple]]. For the [[Warden]]s to release them can only mean the peril is dire indeed.

Their delegation's leader, Allari "the Souleater," claims [[Orgrimmar]] faces a hidden threat. I gave them leave to establish a camp within the city... for now.

You will speak with her at once. Find out whether this threat is credible.

==Completion==
<Allari furrows her brow as she speaks.>

You didn't think the leadership of the Horde could gather in one location and go unnoticed by the [[Burning Legion]], did you?

==Progression==
{{Broken Shore Horde}}
