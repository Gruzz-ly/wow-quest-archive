== Objectives ==
Report to {{NPC||Spiketooth}} at [[Deadeye Shore]] in [[Durotar]].

== Description ==
You, <race>, stop a minute.

My boss Spiketooth sent me to look for help and supplies. You don't appear to be a merchant, but you can probably still help him out. He's just to the southeast of here, next to the crashed cart. Oh, and tell him I sent you... I want to make sure that he knows I'm not just slacking off over here.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost|||35}}

== Completion ==
{{NPC||Vek'nag}} sent you? Without telling you that I need wagon wheels, nails, and rations? That idiot.

==Progression==
