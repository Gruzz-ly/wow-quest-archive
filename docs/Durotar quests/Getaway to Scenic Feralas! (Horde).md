[[File:Getaway to Scenic Feralas.jpg|thumb|The pile of gifts]]

==Objectives==
Take the [[Scenic Getaway Portal]] to [[Feralas]], then deliver the lost gifts to the correct recipients.
*Portal taken to Feralas (Optional)
*Gift picked up
*Gifts returned (3)
*[[Hana's Gift|Hana's gift]] taken
*Take the return portal to Orgrimmar (Optional)
*Gift returned to [[Hana Breezeheart]]

==Description==
Good morrow! Today's special portal is a magical getaway to the sunny beaches of Feralas! The [[Steam Pools]] resort is having a lovely celebration and all are invited!

Unfortunately, some of our festival attendees who took this portal earlier left their gifts here at the gala.

Could you perchance help me return them? I will meet you at the beach and together we shall be able to determine which gifts belong to whom.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
There are so many places in [[Azeroth]] to escape to! Everywhere you look, there's something new to discover.

==Completion==
You are wonderfully helpful, <name>. You have brightened the spirits of many people by returning their gifts to them.

And what an array of gifts they were! Perhaps the language of love looks different to everyone.

==Notes==
Interact with the [[Scenic Getaway Portal]] and choose the Feralas option:
:{{Gossip|quest=|A sunny vacation in Feralas.}}

This teleports the adventurer to the [[Steam Pools]] in southern [[Feralas]]. The weather/environment is changed in the area during the duration of the quest.

An arcane projection of Aurora Vabsley will show up and portal all the gifts on a table at {{Co|69.37|73.22|Feralas}} in the middle of the beach. Pick up the available objects - [[Shiny New Weapon]], [[Barrel of Wine]], [[Lost Puppy]] or [[Mystery Gift]] that contains either a [[Sealed Letter (Love is in the Air)|Sealed Letter]] or a [[Bouquet of Flowers]]:

:{{text|say|Aurora Vabsley|I have brought the gifts! Simply pick up a gift and return it to its rightful owner!}}

There are several characters to deliver gifts or emote at in order to complete the quest, though only three are required:
{{:Love Language Expert}}

{{book|content=
I enjoy a good celebration, but where's a challenge when you need one?
:{{gossip|Are you missing a gift?}}
::The only thing I miss is competition. It's been so long since I've sparred against someone my own strength.
:{{gossip|Does this 'gift' belong to you?}}
::No, that does not belong to me.
:{{gossip|Does this sword belong to you?}}
}}

This party is nice, but I miss a good fight.

:{{gossip|Does this 'gift' belong to you?}}
::No, that does not belong to me.
:{{gossip|Does this sword belong to you?}}
}}
:{{Text|yell|Vernon Whitlock|My new sword, you found it! Now we can have a real fight! En garde!}}
Upon defeating him
:{{Text|say|Vernon Whitlock|Good show, good show! I yield to the better duelist.}}

Interacting with [[Clarissa Buchannan]] upon picking up a gift (requires [[Barrel of Wine]] for objective).
{{book|content=
Ugh. I'm too sober for this conversation.
:{{gossip|Are you missing a gift?}}
::A missing gift? Now that you mention it, my friends and I left our wine back at the gala. 
::I wish I had a drink as stiff as Wilber's small talk.
:{{gossip|Does this 'gift' belong to you?}}
::No, that's not mine.
:{{gossip|Does this wine belong to you?}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Clarissa Buchannan|YES! Finally! I was hoping someone would find this. I can't believe my friends and I left it at the gala!}}

Upon picking up a gift and talking to [[Rizzi]]
{{book|content=
:...And then I said "if you're gonna talk like that to ME, you've got another thing coming!"
:Oh hey. This guy knows what I'm talking about.
:{{gossip|Does this 'gift' belong to you?}}
::Nah I ain't got nothing today. I'm just here to chat.
:::{{gossip|I will talk with you.}}
::::Really, ya mean it?
::::Some folks say I have a big mouth sometimes.
:::{{gossip|Yes, you have my full attention.}}
::::This triggers dialogue.
:::{{gossip|On second thought...}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Rizzi|Okay, so one time, me an' Nikki were shopping for a... well, I forget what it was exactly we set out to get when we left, but we were at the market.}}
:{{Text|say|Rizzi|And you know how most stalls have these HUGE displays? So I said to Nikki, "Nikki, how are we gonna sift through all this junk to find what we're looking for?}}
:{{Text|say|Rizzi|And Nikki says to me, "Rizzi, baby, that's the whole point! We're here to have a good time! It ain't about the purchase, it's about the experience.}}
:{{Text|say|Rizzi|Anyway, what was I saying? Ah, nevermind me. I'm just a big ol' chattermouth! Thanks for listening anyway, I really appreciate it.}}

Upon picking up [[Sealed Letter]] and talking to [[Verilas Sunblood]]
{{book|content=
:This party is lovely, if superficial. True love is spoken from the heart.
:{{gossip|Are you missing a gift?}}
:I know of no gifts which are mine. Besides, material possessions are paltry gifts compared to the beauty of simply expressing one's feelings.
:{{gossip|Does this 'gift' belong to you?}}
::That is not mine.
:{{gossip|Does this letter belong to you?}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Verilas Sunblood|A letter for me?}}

:Am I missing a gift? I... Oh no! BEANIE!
:<Angus stands up and looks around frantically.>
:Have ye seen my dog? Oi, Caitlin's going t' be furious with me if I don't find him!

:Nae, that's not fer me.

{{book|content=
These hooligans are ridiculous. No one shows manners anymore.
:{{gossip|Are you missing a gift?}}
::The only thing MISSING around here is respect!
::Seriously, no one at this "party" seems to be in the mood to show any RESPECT around here. Humph!
:{{gossip|Does this 'gift' belong to you?}}
::That would be a bit far-fetched do you not agree?
}}
Upon /bowing to him

Interacting with [[Theoderic Prescott]] upon picking up any gift.
{{book|content=
:<Theoderic is muttering to himself.>
:Dare I approach someone? Oh but what would I say? Perhaps I have brought the wrong hat for this occasion.
:{{gossip|Are you missing a gift?}}
::Something missing? No, all I miss is a physical connection. Most people are disgusted by my appearance.
:{{gossip|Does this 'gift' belong to you?}}
::Nay, I am all too aware of my own possessions, and that is not among them.
}}
Upon /hugging to him
:{{Text|say|Theoderic Prescott|You--you would give me a hug? Your kindess{{sic}} brings me to tears. Thank you, stranger, thank you so much. You have given me a blessed gift this day!}}

Interacting with [[Halene Mistrunner]] upon picking up any gift.
{{book|content=
This is such a peaceful day.
Does my hair look okay? Maybe I should put it up?
:{{gossip|Are you missing a gift?}}
::Come to think of it, my partner and I were shopping for a new style for my hair. I just love natural accessories!
:{{gossip|Does this 'gift' belong to you?}}
::That is not mine, but I do hope you find who it belongs to!
}}

Interacting with [[Bratley Graston]] upon picking up any gift.
{{book|content=
Have you seen my gorgeous muscles?
It's the beauty on the outside that matters most.
:{{gossip|Are you missing a gift?}}
::In my haste to get here, I left the only thing that could complement my natural beauty.
::<Bratley kisses his bicep.>
::But I accept who I am, babe. I am living in the present moment.
:{{gossip|Does this 'gift' belong to you?}}
::Gaze upon my perfect face as I say this to you. I've never seen that before in my life.

There are also a few more lovely guests in the area who don't count towards the quest or the achievement:
*[[Maggie Diamond]]
*[[Daz'dono]]
*[[Lyanna Silverleaf]]
*[[Thalia Ambertear]]

Interacting with [[Daz'dono]] upon picking up any gift.

Now dis is what I'm talking about! De beach, de breeze, what more could you ask for?

{{book|content=
Waiting in line hurts my back.
:{{gossip|Are you missing a gift?}}
::The only thing I miss is my wife, and I doubt you can bring her back after the war.
:{{gossip|Does this 'gift' belong to you?}}
::Hah! I'm chuffed you think that's mine, but no.
:{{gossip|Does this puppy belong to you?}}
::No, but perhaps check with the hunter there. He seems the sort who might appreciate another animal companion.
}}
After giving gifts to three people: 
:{{Text|yell|Aurora Vabsley|Hey <name>, come back! I found another gift!}}
:{{Text|say|Aurora Vabsley|Could you deliver this one to Hana Breezeheart, the florist at the gala?}}

After picking up [[Hana's Gift]], take the Portal to Orgrimmar and go to [[Hana Breezeheart]]:
{{book|content=
{{Gossip|quest=|This gift is for you.}}

Oh? I wasn't expecting anything.

<Hana opens the gift. Inside is a letter, which she reads out loud.>

"Dearest Hana, I am but one of many customers you helped this week. Your flowers helped me truly express my identity. Thank you for seeing me for who I really am. With love, [[Laverne Cameron]]."

<Hana wipes away a tear.>

Thank you, <name>. To me, there is no greater gift than helping others be their best selves.}}

This completes the quest objectives.
