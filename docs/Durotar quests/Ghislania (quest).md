==Objectives==
Defeat Ghislania in combat.
*[[Ghislania]] defeated

==Description==
I own a couple gladiators that I put into competitions around [[Kalimdor]]. You can see most of them chained up around here... we were lucky to rein these ones in after the cart broke down.

Ghislania, that [[naga]] over there... she's lost her last three fights. She could use a tune-up, or maybe just a little bit of thrashing. Go challenge her, I'll bet even YOU are stronger than she is.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||2|50}}

==Progress==
How'd you fare?

==Completion==
I watched you fight there. How long you been a <class>?

You're alright, kid.

==Notes==
{{Raidicon|Skull}} [[Ghislania]] is chained to a large rock just off the coast, north and east from Spiketooth's position.

Click on her, and she asks:
:What do you want, <race>?

:{{Gossip|I'm here to challenge you in combat.}}

Defeat her (you can't kill her) and return to Spiketooth.
