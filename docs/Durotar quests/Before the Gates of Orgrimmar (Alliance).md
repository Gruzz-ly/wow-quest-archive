==Objectives==
Begin the battle at the gates of [[Orgrimmar]].
*Speak with [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] to begin the battle

==Description==
We have prepared for this battle as best we can, <name>. I pray that we all survive what is to come.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Saurfang... he gave his life so our soldiers wouldn't lose theirs.

None of us anticipated that he would challenge Sylvanas directly. But perhaps she did.

<Jaina shakes her head.>

It does us no good to debate whether this was part of her plan or if she merely took advantage of an opportunity. We must be on our guard against her schemes.

Saurfang won his final battle. I do not know what will become of the Horde, but I have hope that they will find a new path to follow.

==Notes==
Speak to Anduin to begin the event. 

{{Dialogue|
This is our one and only chance. We must stop Sylvanas here and now.

{{Gossip|I am ready. For the Alliance!}}

A brief cutscene plays showing [[Varok Saurfang]], accompanied by [[Thrall]], Anduin, and the player character, approaching the gates of Orgrimmar. It then segues into the [[Reckoning]] cinematic:
