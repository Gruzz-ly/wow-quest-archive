==Objectives==
Recall the [[Alliance]] forces and inform them of what has transpired.
* Speak with [[Genn Greymane]]
* Return to Jaina before the gates of [[Orgrimmar]].

==Description==
[[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]]... how could this have happened....

<Jaina takes a moment to compose herself.>

The Alliance has known High Overlord Saurfang as both a sworn enemy and an invaluable ally.

[[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]] will want to honor his memory. Recall our forces and inform them of what has happened. Genn's [[soldier]]s were dispatched to the western gate. You should be able to find him there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
He died a warrior's death, as he always wanted. I suppose there is some comfort in that.

==Completion==
Many have lost their lives to this war. Let us hope Saurfang is the last.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Regent Lord, what manner of magic did Sylvanas use against Saurfang?}}
:{{text|say|[[Lor'themar Theron]]|I had hoped either you or Thalyssra would have the answer to that question. I have never seen her wield such power.}}
:{{text|say|[[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]|It was unlike any magic I have ever encountered. I could sense none of it, even in her presence.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Then she must have only recently acquired it... or simply waited until now to reveal it.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Either way, it does not bode well for us. Whatever she is planning, she no longer needs the Horde to achieve it.}}

;Speaking with Genn
{{Dialogue|
Long have I waited for this moment, <name>. I will finally claim justice for Liam.

{{Gossip|Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to mak'gora. And then...}}
}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|Saurfang is dead and Sylvanas has escaped?}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|This is no victory. I care not who leads the Horde or if they tear each other apart.}}
:{{Text|say|Genn Greymane|All that matters is slaying the Banshee. And we have missed our chance.}}

==Progression==
