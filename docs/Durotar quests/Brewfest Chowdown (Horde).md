==Description==
Mok-rah, <class>! I hope you came with an empty stomach!

Back on {{Au|Draenor}}, we often held eating contests at our festivals as a form of celebration. When we were put in charge of [[Brewfest]], we could think of nothing better to add to the event!

Take a seat and show us what you can eat. If you want more details before jumping in, just ask!

==Progress==
Eat a sausage, drink some brew, then eat some more!
