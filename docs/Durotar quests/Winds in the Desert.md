==Objectives==
Retrieve 5 Sacks of Supplies and return them to [[Rezlak]] near [[Orgrimmar]].
*[[Sack of Supplies]] (5)

==Description==
I'm Rezlak, one of [[Gazlowe]]'s boys. Boss sent me to help the [[orc]]s here in [[Durotar]]. Things'd been going good except for the caravans. Can't manage to keep them safe! Makes my job a little harder, you know?

The last shipment, which they PROMISED would get through, was snatched by the [[Dustwind]] [[harpy|harpies]] of... where was it... [[Razorwind Canyon]]?

I gotta have those supplies! Follow the big canyon to the south, you'll find the ravine cut right into the west and east sides of the walls.

==Rewards==
You  will receive: {{cost||3}}

==Progress==
I'm great at what I do, don't get me wrong, but this is ridiculous! What am I supposed to do, build sand castles?

==Completion==
Hey, now isn't that just the thing! You've got our supplies back for us. That's great. I'll be able to get back to work just as soon as I can find someone to haul these sacks for me.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Securing the Lines]] from [[Rezlak]] as well and you can kill harpies while you pick up supplies to complete both quests.

This quest, along with [[Securing the Lines]], can be completed by Alliance as well as Horde.

You will need one inventory spot open to retrieve the 5 {{loot|common|Sack of Supplies|Sacks of Supplies}}, which are required to complete this quest, from [[Razorwind Canyon]].

The sacks are found in two areas. Both areas can be found by going into the canyon that leads to Razor Hill, then turning either right or left midway through the canyon. Either way will lead to Razorwind Canyon, which is filled with sacks and harpies.
