== Objectives ==
Destroy 12 Warring Elementals. You may slay either {{NPC||Furious Earthguard||Furious Earthguards}} or {{NPC||Teeming Waterguard||Teeming Waterguards}}.
* Warring Elemental slain (12)

== Description ==
Ignore [[Shin Stonepillar|the shaman]], soldier. Certain powers-that-be within the Horde demand that I keep him with me, but I assure you, that [[Thrall]]-loving farseer truly sees no farther than the borders of this hut.

[[Elemental]]s war against one another to the west of here. I normally wouldn't mind, but I need that land clear to secure a broader shipping route to and from the [[Northern Barrens|Barrens]]. The elementals are normally quite strong, but they are weakened by their attacks against one another. Use this knowledge to destroy them.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Feckless Armbands
|Heedless Treads
|Bindings of Disregard
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +350 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

== Progress ==
Elementals? Pfuh! No match for the power of the Horde.

== Completion ==
See? That shaman's tales are nothing but that... a youngling's bedtime stories. The new Horde takes what it wants, and doesn't waste time with such frivolity.

If you get a chance, I recommend you tell Shin... and those like him... not to waste any more of your time.
