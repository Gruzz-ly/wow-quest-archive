== Objectives ==
Destroy 3 Northwatch Supply Crates and kill 10 Northwatch Lugs.
*[[Northwatch Supply Crate]]s destroyed (3)
*[[Northwatch Lug]] slain (10)

== Description ==
Aw man, this ain't good. Not one bit, mon.

[[Thrall]]'s off to sea, [[Vol'jin]]'s taking care of business in [[Echo Isles]], and old Master Gadrin is left behind to take care of Sen'jin. And then what happens? Those [[human]]s come outta [[Northwatch Hold]] and set up [[Northwatch Foothold|camp]] in our backyard!

Lucky for us, they just got here, and they're still setting up their base. You can help out old Gadrin by destroying those big supply crates they carry, and by killing the laborers carryin' them. You'll find'm to the southwest.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||1|25}}

==Progress==
We gotta get rid of these humans, <class>.

== Completion ==
Well, we've stymied their efforts for now, but they're still here.  We'll have to press on, <name>.

==Notes==
[[File:Northwatch Supply Crate and Northwatch Lugs.jpg|thumb|In Northwatch Foothold.]]
The Northwatch Supply Crates start out around {{coords|52.6|81.7|Durotar}} or so, and the Northwatch Lugs spawn at regular intervals. If left unmolested, they will form a chain of mobs between the spawn point and the encampments in [[Northwatch Foothold]]; however, if many players are killing them, they may be backed up, in which case simply wait at the spawn point on the shore.

The Lugs have a ridiculously small health pool (21 health) and are no challenge despite coming three to a crate. Be sure to strike them rather than having an ability like the druid's [[Thorns]] or hunter's pet kill them, as you will not receive credit.
