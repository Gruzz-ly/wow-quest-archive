==Objectives==
Visit the beer gardens outside of [[Silvermoon]], [[Thunder Bluff]], and the [[Undercity]], zap three [[elekk]]s at each location, and return to Glodrak Huntsniper. You must be drunk to see the pink elekks.
*[[Eversong Pink Elekk]] (3)
*[[Mulgore Pink Elekk]] (3)
*[[Tirisfal Pink Elekk]] (3)
*[[Elekk Dispersion Ray]] (provided)

==Description==
Look. We're running a business here. People being drunk? It's good business. But I'll tell ya one thing that puts a cramp in the profits - hallucinations. Wouldn't ya know it, the boys are reporting that the sot- er, the loyal customers are seeing pink elekks everywhere.

I don't need my customers unsettled. Look, take this ray and travel to the other beer gardens to take care of 'em for me, would ya? And be sure to get drunk!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Brewfest Prize Token]] (40)

==Progress==
Ya clear up that little problem we talked about?

==Completion==
Ya did good, kid. Here, take this as payment for the job ya did.

==Notes==
You have to drink alcoholic beverages until you get the message "You are drunk", and then drink once more.  The pesky pink elekks can then be seen are all over the area around the brewfest, and some area beyond as well.  (You can see the pink elekks once you become drunk, but without the extra drink you may become sober again before you have time to zap three of them.)

Even though the quest giver appears in a "classic" zone, it requires players to visit [[Burning Crusade]] zones. Therefore, players whose accounts are not upgraded with the first expansion set are unable to even pick up this quest.
