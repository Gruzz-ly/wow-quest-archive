==Objectives==
Report to [[Gor the Enforcer]] at the [[Dranosh'ar Blockade]] in [[Durotar]].

==Description==
You should head north from here, <name>.  Speak with [[Gor the Enforcer]] at the [[Dranosh'ar Blockade]].  He's been placed in charge of securing shipping lanes for [[Orgrimmar]], and [[Skull Rock]] sits right next to his precious [[Bladefist Bay|dock]].  I'm certain he'll be interested in picking up where we left off.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost|||85}} (or {{cost||1|20}} at max level)

==Completion==
You're the one who handled the [[Burning Blade]] to the south? I've got ears in all kinds of places, <my girl/boy>, and word travels fast.

==Notes==
[[The Dranosh'ar Blockade]] sits just outside the southern entrace to [[Orgrimmar]]. From [[Razor Hill]] head north along the road. The road will take you to the southern entrance, and [[Gor the Enforcer]] can be found in a structure on the left before you enter [[Orgrimmar]].

On your way from [[Razor Hill]] to the [[Dranosh'ar Blockade]] you will come across the goblin {{Raidicon|Cross}} [[Rezlak]] who has some quests to kill [[Dustwind]] [[Harpy|harpies]] in [[Drygulch Ravine]]{{co|52.3|27.3|Durotar}}.
