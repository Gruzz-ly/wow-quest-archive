== Objectives ==
Hear the moral of [[Shin Stonepillar]]'s story.
* Listen to the shaman's fable

== Description ==
[[Gor the Enforcer|My "associate"]] here has some plans for you that I don't agree with. His actions are hasty, uncontrolled, and irresponsible, and you may end up paying for them with your life.

Before you work with Gor, first listen to the tale that I have to tell. It's a moralistic story - a fable - but I believe its lesson will prove valuable. Speak to me when you are ready. 

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}

== Progress ==
Pay close attention to the meaning behind my words, child.

== Completion ==
The moral of the story: hasty, lazy actions have ruinous results. We mustn't take shortcuts... we must work for our rewards. I've been trying to tell this story to the "Enforcer", but I fear his [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]]-worshipping skull is a little bit too thick.

== Notes ==
You will gain the buff Hunting while doing this quest, which will transform you into a wolf. [[The Wolf]] has one ability, Dash, which will temporarily raise movement speed and give a semi-random line of the story when used. On approaching any of the pairs of [[The Kodo|battling kodos]] to the east (near [[Bladefist Bay]]), the rest of the story will be told automatically.
