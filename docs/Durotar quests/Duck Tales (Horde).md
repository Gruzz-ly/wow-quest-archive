==Objectives==
Use the potion to get information from 5 [[duck]]s.
*Potion used
*Information gathered (5)
*[[Duck Potion]] (provided)

==Description==
Take this potion, <name>. Drink it, and you should be able to chit chat with those feathery fiends.

Oh, but if you happen to experience any... unintended side effects, don't blame me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Brightly Colored Egg]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Have they said anything interesting?

==Completion==
What? Some of the ducks are [[druid]]s?

They won't get away with this!

==Notes==
Upon accept, Tethris disappears. Use the potion and talk to [[Furious Duck]]s:
*{{Text|say|Furious Duck|Quick, go steal those eggs for [[Daetan Swiftplume|Daetan]]!}}
*{{Text|say|Furious Duck|Hey, don't blow my cover!}}
*{{Text|say|Furious Duck|How did you--did Daetan send you?}}

Actual ducks will respond with:
*{{Text|say|Furious Duck|The duck gives you a quizzical look.}}
*{{Text|say|Furious Duck|Quack?}}

==Progression==
{{What the Duck}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.2.6|note=Added.}}
