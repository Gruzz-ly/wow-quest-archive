==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Fizzle Darkclaw.jpg|Fizzle Darkclaw|I imagine he'll look a little more waterlogged by the time you get to him.}}
Obtain Fizzle's Orb from [[Fizzle Darkclaw]] in [[Thunder Ridge]].
* [[Fizzle's Orb]]

==Description==
The flood to the southwest wiped out one of the few [[Burning Blade]] camps that still pockmark Durotar.  This one was led by a goblin named Fizzle Darkclaw, and believe me, we're better off without him.

Darkclaw, however, did possess an orb that the Horde is interested in procuring.  Who knows why... I leave that to the warlocks.  All I know is that I need that orb.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Fizzle's Gloves
|Enforcer's Gloves
|Gor's Re-Inforced Gloves
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|||55}}
* 200 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]

==Progress==
Run into any trouble on the way?

==Completion==
I ask for an orb, and you bring half of the goblin's arm with you?  I like the way you work.

Tell you what... you've already given me a hand.  Allow me to return the favor.

==Notes==
The side quest [[Thunder Down Under]] is best done with this quest, as it is in the same area and will provide you with a water breathing spell.

To reach Thunder Ridge, exit the area around the hut and take the path going west. Go past [[Rocktusk Farm]]. There will be a group of cacti south of the road. Past this is Thunder Ridge. Fizzle Darkclaw is under the water. His corpse will be at {{coords|42.2|26.6|Durotar}}, in the area surrounded by [[Swollen Voidwalker]]s. 

On clicking Darkclaw's corpse:
:<Fizzle's body bobs lifelessly. His orb is clutched tightly in his right hand.>
:{{gossip|<Attempt to remove the orb.>}}  
:<You grab at the orb, but Fizzle's hand clutches around it even tighter. The orb glows slightly.>
Choose one of the following options:
:{{gossip|<Attempt to remove Fizzle's Hand, then.>}} 
* This causes a cast bar of removing Fizzle's Hand. When it ends you will receive [[Fizzle's Orb]].
:{{gossip|<Give up. This is too scary.>}} 
* This will close the dialogue.
