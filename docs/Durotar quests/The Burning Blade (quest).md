==Objectives==
Obtain 6 [[Burning Blade Spellscroll]]s from members of the [[Burning Blade]] in [[Dustwind Cave]].
* [[Burning Blade Spellscroll]] (6)

==Description==
I've been sent to investigate the presence of more Burning Blade agents here in Durotar. To the northeast, you'll find a cave where the organization trains their new recruits. I'm interested in what exactly they are teaching these neophytes.

I only tell you this because you seem to be looking for work. If you're interested in a little coin, sack the cave and return with their spellscrolls.

The cave is somewhat hidden: exit [[Razor Hill]] from the east, and follow the canyon's eastern ridge.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}

==Progress==
The scrolls, <name>, the scrolls!

==Completion==
This is quite interesting. These rites aren't all that different from the spells which are taught to Horde warlocks. This merits further investigation!

==Notes==
To find the cave, go to the north side of Razor Hill. Instead of going into the canyon, turn right and go past the fence. Turn left as soon as you are able. Go up the ridge and head north. The cave will be straight ahead at {{coords|52.8|28.7|Durotar}}.

The Burning Blade in the cavern have a high chance of inflicting Felblood on player upon their death, which ''significantly'' increases Fire and Shadow damage taken if it stacks more than once. Either try to drop the stacks if they get to 2 or 3, or gain 5 stacks to transform into a demon for 30 seconds, granting you increased health regeneration and critical hit rate, along with immunity to Felblood. Do take note, that explosion that inflicts Felblood also deals Fire damage - keep yourself topped up to avoid a mutual kill situations.
