==Objectives==
Defeat Gaur Icehorn in combat.
*[[Gaur Icehorn]] defeated

==Description==
I wouldn't normally keep a [[taunka]] as a captive, due to their close relationship with the [[Horde]]... but this one is a traitor, and a criminal to boot. Exiled by his own tribe, he canoed down to [[Azshara]] and was found stealing supplies from [[Valormok]]. He would have been put to the axe had I not been standing by, wallet in hand.

Gaur is my winningest gladiator, <class>. I'll bet you 10 silver that you can't beat him.

==Rewards==
You will receive: {{cost||7}}

==Progress==
You don't stand a chance against Gaur.

==Completion==
Fine, here's the money... but you'd better make yourself scarce before I reconsider my policy on keeping Horde slaves.

==Notes==
{{Raidicon|Skull}} [[Gaur Icehorn]] is chained to the base of the cliffs on the coast just north of Spiketooth's position.

Click on him, and he asks:
:Do I frighten you, <class>?

:{{Gossip|I'm here to challenge you in combat.}}

Defeat him (you can't kill him) and return to Spiketooth.  He stiffs you {{cost||3}} of your {{cost||10}} reward.
