*[[Raptor Blood]]
*[["Long Knife"]] Collected
*Return to Farseer Aggralan in Razor Hill

==Description==
If Gor'krosh is a truly a raptor, you should be able to track it down just like any other animal.

See if you can find its trail. We know it's been around here recently. Corner it in its lair and end this once and for all!

Make sure you return to Razor Hill straight away once you make the kill. [[Aggralan|The Farseer]] will need proof of the deed.

Thank you, <name>. May the spirits guide your blade. Lok-tar!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Do you have the trophy? Have you painted your face with the blood of your kill? You will not receive your blessing until the deed is done.

==Completion==
<Aggra inspects the blood on your face carefully. Satisfied with what she sees, she nods.>

A clean kill. You have defended the young and the weak honorably. The spirits are pleased.

You have earned the blessing of the clan.

...You may have your clothes back.

==Notes==
[[File:Raptor Blood.jpg|thumb|The patch of [[Raptor Blood]].]]
A sparse trail of [[Beast Tracks]] like the one the player inspected in [[Tracking a Killer]] lead over the hills and out of the Valley of Trials, continuing east before climbing into the steep cliffs between [[Tiragarde Keep]] and the [[Darkspear Strand]], where a raptor's lair complete with some [[Dead Peon]]s and a [[Raptor Nest]] awaits. Interact with the Raptor Nest to spawn Gor'krosh. Upon death, it creates a patch of [[Raptor Blood]]. Interact with the blood to gain the Blood Paint buff:
:{{Abilities|Blood Paint|id=398917|Painted in the fresh blood of Gor'krosh.|icon=ability_deathwing_bloodcorruption_death|notes=10 min duration.}}

Loot the [["Long Knife"]] from Gor'krosh and return to Aggralan in Razor Hill. In addition to the player's chosen chieftain, [[Thrall]] is now standing next to his life-mate, regardless of whether or not the player picked the Frostwolves during [[The Blessing of the Clan]] (if they picked the Frostwolves, only Thrall is present). Upon completion, the player loses the Champion of the Orcs buff, causing their armor to show back up, and their chieftain congratulates them:
