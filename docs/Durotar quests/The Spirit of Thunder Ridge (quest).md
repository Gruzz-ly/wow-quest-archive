[[File:Buried Seed.jpg|thumb|[[Buried Seed]].]]
Work with [[the Spirit of Thunder Ridge]] to restore life to [[Thunder Ridge|the area]].
*[[Ancient Seed (Durotar)]] (8)
*Return to the [[Ancient Skeleton]]{{Co|40.6|26.76|Durotar}}
*Seeds Planted in Ancient Skeleton{{Co|40.6|26.76|Durotar}}
*Return to Farseer Aggralan in Razor Hill

==Description==
Life can only thrive when a delicate balance is maintained. The arrival of [[Orc|your people]] and the [[human]]s was but the first link in the chain that led to desolation.

You yourself are not to blame, but you can be the force that restores what once was.

Dive into the waters below and recover the seeds buried in the silt. They are a memory of the ancient forest that once grew in harmony with [[Thunder lizard|my people]].

Beware, the elements are not at peace here.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
You return! I trust you have aided the Spirit of Thunder Ridge?

==Completion==
You have done well, <name>. The spirits sing your praises on the wind.

Eventually, Thunder Ridge will flourish into a new oasis, benefiting the people of Orgrimmar and the thunder lizards alike.

You have earned the blessing of the land.

==Notes==
*On accept, the player is granted the Boon of Thunder Ridge buff:
:{{Abilities|Boon of Thunder Ridge|id=398555|The Spirit of Thunder Ridge has offered you her boon while you work in her stead, increasing your swim speed, allowing you to breathe underwater, and imbuing you with the power of the Thunder Lizard.|icon=spell_nature_giftofthewaterspirit}}

* A gossip line is available after accepting the  quest it says:
:Once this place teemed with life.

:It could once more, with your aid.

*Ancient Seeds are looted from [[Buried Seed]]s across the lakefloor. The waters are populated by translucent and neutral [[Flood Elemental (Durotar)|Flood Elementals]], [[Mud Elemental]]s, and small packs of [[Eroded Stone Elemental]]s. Interacting with a Buried Seed causes a hostile version of one of the elementals to spawn and attack.

*Once all seeds have been collected, return to the Ancient Skeleton and the Spirit:
:{{Text|whisper|The Spirit of Thunder Ridge|You return. Success lifts your steps.}}
:{{Text|whisper|The Spirit of Thunder Ridge|Life still dwells inside the seeds, dormant, awaiting its chance.}}
:{{Text|whisper|The Spirit of Thunder Ridge|Plant them inside my remains, and observe what power I still wield.}}

*Interact with the Skeleton to plant the seeds. This causes the Spirit to assume her true form, [[Owa'nohe]]. She casts {{Abilities|Spirit Growth|id=400422|icon=inv_misc_trailofflowers}}, causing a cluster of small Sprouting Trees to grow out of the skeleton, before she fades from view.
:{{Text|say|Owa'nohe|The ancient forest will return... in time...}}
:{{Text|say|Owa'nohe|My kind will return... in time...}}
:{{Text|say|Owa'nohe|By your hands, this has been set in motion.}}
:{{Text|say|Owa'nohe|You have our gratitude, <name>. Go, in peace.}}

*Return to Razor Hill and turn in to Aggralan.
