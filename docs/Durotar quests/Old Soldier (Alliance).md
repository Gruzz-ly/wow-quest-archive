==Objectives==
Speak with [[Jaina]] in front of the [[gates of Orgrimmar]].
* [[Varok Saurfang|High Overlord Saurfang]] honored

==Description==
No matter what doubts he harbored, Saurfang was an honorable [[soldier]].

He prevented both a civil war within the [[Horde]] and the potential destruction of the [[Alliance]]. He brought an end to [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]'s reign and saved many lives at the cost of his own.

We shall honor his sacrifice.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you: {{abilities|Battlefield Commendation|icon=inv_scroll_11|id=311724}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|70|20}}
* 26,800 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Thank you for coming.

==Completion==
We continue to fall into old habits of mistrust and suspicion. Of hatred and war...

And yet, we also find ourselves banding together and rising against the forces that would destroy [[Azeroth|our world]].

I pray that the day will come when we break the cycle for good.

==Notes==
;Speaking with Jaina
{{Dialogue|
We will withdraw our forces from [[Durotar]]. Our purpose was to defeat Sylvanas. Though she yet lives, she no longer leads the Horde. Hopefully, we can now unite against [[N'Zoth]].

[[Anduin Wrynn|King Anduin]] has asked for us to join him in honoring Saurfang.

A cutscene plays, with the Horde forces assembled outside [[Grommash Hold]] in the [[Valley of Strength]], along with [[Anduin Wrynn]], [[Jaina Proudmoore]], [[Valeera Sanguinar]], and [[Master Mathias Shaw]]. The player character stands next to [[Zekhan]] and [[Baine Bloodhoof]]. Saurfang's body lies on a slab, as Thrall speaks.

:''Thrall rests a hand on the slab.''
:{{text|say|Thrall|You have earned your warrior's death, old friend.}}
:{{text|say|Thrall|Now, greet your son... with honor and glory.}}
:''Thrall salutes Saurfang, and Zekhan blows a war horn as the assembled Horde all kneel. Anduin, Shaw, and Valeera all depart through a portal opened by Jaina to Boralus.''

Speak to Jaina to complete the quest, which awards the "Veteran of the Fourth War" title and completes the achievement [[The Fourth War]], concluding the [[Alliance War Campaign]].

;On completion
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|This is how war always ends for us... with blood on our hands, mourning those we lost. No amount of fighting can ever bring them back.}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|[[The Fall of Shan Bu (Alliance)|The cycle ends when we choose to walk away]]. I wasn't ready to learn that lesson before. Few may be ready now. But learn it we must.}}
