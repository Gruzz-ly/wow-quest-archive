==Objectives==
Escape with Eitrigg and meet up with [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] in Razor Hill.
* Speak with [[Eitrigg]]
* Reach the [[Doras|Flightmaster]]
* [[Deathguard Razza]] slain
* [[Hijacked Wind-Rider|Wyvern]] to [[Razor Hill]] taken

==Description==
There is little time. [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] likely knows of my intentions and sent you to deal with me accordingly. I doubt she will be pleased with your decision.

We must make our way to the [[wyvern]]s and take to the skies.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Eitrigg]] told me of your escape from Orgrimmar. There may still be other dissenters within the city who are unable to leave such as you did.

All we can do for them now is end this battle before Sylvanas makes them suffer.
