==Objectives==
Kneel at the Loa Altar in Sen'jin Village. Commune with the Loa spirit, then use the memory to learn a new ability. Afterwards, return to Ken'jai in the Valley of Trails.
*Learn Spell: Engrave Gloves - [[Penance (priest rune)]]

==Description==
Joining the Horde has given our people a safe home, <name>, but we must remember that it is the Loa who are always watching over us.

Now, clear your mind, and I will share an ancient memory with you. Go to the Loa Altar in Sen'jin Village, and kneel before it to commune with the great Loa spirit. Once you have received the Loa's wisdom, you will come to understand the memory I have given you. Through this understanding, you will discover a new power.

Return to me once you have done this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 85 [[XP]]
*+50 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]
*[[Tattered Cloth Gloves]]

==Progress==
What have the Loa taught you, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Applying the rune to your equipment will grant you powerful new abilities.

The Loa will grant you many more memories along your journey. You can pray at Loa Altars across Azeroth to clear your thoughts and interpret them, as you have just done.

Understanding more complex visions may require the help of fellow priests within the Horde. Do not be afraid to learn from their faith, <name>. The wisdom of the Loa can be found in all things.
