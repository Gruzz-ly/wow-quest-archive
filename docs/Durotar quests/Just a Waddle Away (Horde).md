==Objectives==
Discover the [[duck]]'s hiding spot.
*Potion used
*[[Daetan Swiftplume|Daetan]] found
*[[Golden Egg Heirloom|Heirloom found]]
*[[Duck Potion]] (provided)

==Description==
We simply must find out where those ducks are hiding our stolen goods--and my precious egg! Oh, and who this mysterious Daetan is, of course. 

I convinced [[Tethris Dewgazer|Tethris]] to give me more of that potion. Take it and bring back my golden heirloom!

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
{{Itembox||Black Duck Disguise|Brown Duck Disguise|Mallard Duck Disguise|Pink Duck Disguise|White Duck Disguise|Yellow Duck Disguise}}

You will also receive:
*[[Brightly Colored Egg]]
*[[Duck Disguiser]]
*10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Where would those ducks be hiding...

==Completion==
<Sylnaria carefully examines the golden egg.>

Ugh! Did a duck gnaw on this? My poor darling, don't you worry--we'll polish you up to a bright shine soon enough!

Thank you for your help, <name>.

==Notes==
[[File:Golden Egg Heirloom.jpg|thumb|The [[Golden Egg Heirloom]] next to the nest]]
Use the potion and leave Razor Hill through the west exit. Follow the path with [[Mischievous Duck]]s and [[Relaxed Duck]]s. Where the Watershed starts at {{Co|48.42|43.96|Durotar}}, [[Daetan Swiftplume]] appears.
:{{Text|say|Daetan Swiftplume|To the nest, my friends! We will end this ridiculous festival of colored eggs.}}
:''Daetan flies northward.''

Follow suit and find his nest at {{Co|44.57|35.20|Durotar}} and loot [[Golden Egg Heirloom]]. Completing this quest unlocks [[Quacking Down (Horde)]].

[[File:Daetan Swiftplume combat.jpg|thumb|Combat with [[Daetan Swiftplume]]]]
Additionally, if other players have not already done so, drag the Golden Egg onto the nest to summon [[Daetan Swiftplume]], who drops the [[Noblegarden Trinket]], which starts [[Feathered Fiend (Horde)]]. Daetan's first kill also awards the [[Quacked Killer]] achievement.
