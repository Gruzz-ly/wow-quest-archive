==Objectives==
Find the stolen icon by slaying scorpids in the [[Valley of Trials]]. Learn its power, then report back to [[Shikrik]].
*Learn Spell: Engrave Chest - [[Overload]]

==Description==
[[Shamanism]] is an ancient practice, <name>. Many artifacts, full of spiritual energy, can be found across [[Azeroth]]. I had recently discovered an icon of notable power myself, but it was stolen by those pesky [[scorpid]]s.

One of them is likely carrying it around, thinking it a shiny curio to be used as a decoration for their nest.

When you find the icon, learn its power and return to me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*90 [[XP]]
*[[Cracked Leather Vest]]
*{{Race|Orc|notext}} +50 [[reputation]] with [[Orgrimmar (faction)|Orgrimmar]]
*{{Race|Troll|notext}} +50 [[reputation]] with [[Darkspear Trolls]]

==Progress==
Have you found the icon, <name>?

==Completion==
Well done, <name>. Applying the rune to your equipment will grant you powerful new abilities.

There are many such runes throughout Azeroth. Seek them out, as they will help along your journey.

==Patch changes==
