==Objectives==
[[File:Feast for the Ancestors placed.jpg|thumb|The Feast for the Ancestors.]]
Cook the [[orc]]ish dishes and then place the [[:Feast for the Ancestors]] at the offering stone.
*[[Grilled Southfury Salmon]] Cooked (3)
*[[Seared Spicy Talbuk Steak]] Cooked (3)
*[[Curried Coconut Crab]] Cooked (2)
*[[Feast for the Ancestors]] Cooked
*Feast for the Ancestors Placed{{Co|53.14|45.8|Durotar}}

==Description==
Now that we have everything on the list, you just have to put it all together, right? How hard could it be?

Umm... I'm going to let you handle it, though. I'll watch.

{{Text|yell|<Cooking Recipes can be found under Orcish Cuisine in Classic Cooking.>}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Progress==
Is your task complete?

==Completion==
You have done well. It is a rare thing for the ancestors to cross over and manifest before an offering. Yours must have been truly worthy. I hope [[Durak]] appreciates the honor that was just bestowed upon him, as well.

When the [[om'gora]] is finished, you should pass on the messages you received for the others. I think [[Varok Saurfang|he]] would appreciate it.

<She offers you a quick wink.>

==Notes==
On accept, all of the reagents collected during [[Orcish Groceries]] get dumped back into the player's bags. Open the [[Classic Cooking]] interface, where an Orcish Cuisine section has temporarily been added. Cook the three smaller meals, which are then in turn used with the [[Keg of Ancestral Ale]] as reagents for the [[Feast for the Ancestors]]. Upon creating the Feast:
:{{Text|say|Cook Torka|Very good! place your feast at the offering stone to the southeast.}}
:{{Text|say|Cook Torka|May your efforts be rewarded, and your offering accepted!}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|That smells delicious! ...do the dead actually eat?}}

A large, normally nondescript stone formation in the [[Razor Hill Outskirts]] south of town has been adorned with Horde banners and small clan markings. Place the Feast by interacting with the ghost object on the side facing Razor Hill.
:{{Text|say|Durak|You did it! ...how do we know if it worked?}}

The player then gets a Visiting Spirits debuff for 10 minutes:
:{{Abilities|Visiting Spirits|id=400792|The ancestor spirits can only visit for a short time. Speak to them while you can.|icon=ability_racial_ancestralcall}}

Moments later, some old familiar faces appear: the spirits of [[Orgrim Doomhammer]], [[Grommash Hellscream]], [[Broxigar the Red]], [[Varok Saurfang]], [[Durotan]], and [[Draka]] materialize and walk forward to stand in a half-circle around the player and Durak, while the zone music changes to Saurfang's theme from {{Expac|Battle for Azeroth}}.
:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|Your offering is worthy, my friend. You have earned our blessing.}}
:''Varok salutes the player.''
:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|May your actions continue to lead the orcs to honor and glory.}}
:''Orgrim, Grommash, Broxigar, Durotan, and Draka salute the player.''
:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|If you would... tell [[Eitrigg]] he was right. And [[Thrall]]--tell him I am heartened to have [[Safe Haven|dragged him out of seclusion]]!}}
:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|Ah, and you! Durak, son of Thrall!}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|Me?!}}
:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|You will find your path in due time. And it will lead you to greatness.}}
:''Durak bows.''
:{{Text|say|Durak|I... I will do my best. Thank you!}}
:{{Text|say|Varok Saurfang|Go now, with honor. Always.}}

The spirits stick around as long as the player's Visiting Spirits debuff lasts. Each of them has dialogue for the player.

;Varok Saurfang, default dialogue
:Hail, <name>! The first seeker of true honor!
:There is nothing more to say. We are proud of all you have accomplished, and we will be watching over you as our people cross the threshold of a new age.
:Please, deliver my messages to the others when you can. After everything that happened, they will want to know that all is well in the end.

;Varok Saurfang, to characters who sided with him in [[Tracking Tipoff]]
:Hail, <name>! The first seeker of true honor!
:In the [[Fourth War|darkest days]] of the Horde, when defying the will of a tyrant risked death, you stood at my side. If you had not [[A Warrior's Death|aided me on that day]] in the [[Swamp of Sorrows]], I would never have been able to show our people what [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] had truly become.
:It is due to your efforts that our people will cross over this threshold into a bright new age. We will continue to watch over you with pride.
:Please, deliver my messages to the others when you can. After everything that happened, they will want to know that all is well in the end.
:Oh, and one last message, if you do not mind: Next time you see [[Zekhan]], tell him I have found them. [[Remda|My]] [[Dranosh Saurfang|family]].

;Orgrim Doomhammer
:Hail, <name>! The first seeker of true honor!
:How everything has changed since [[Hammerfall|I fell]] in [[Arathi Highlands|Arathi]]! The orcs have come to another foreign land, but this time free of the subjugation of the [[human]]s. They have found their place among all these other races, true brothers and sisters in arms! I am truly proud of all of you.
:And I will be honest--I am glad Thrall has returned to wearing my armor after his years of inner strife. He has always struggled to balance the warrior and the shaman within himself, but it seems he has finally found a place of happiness.

;Grommash Hellscream
:Hail, <name>! The first seeker of true honor!
:Look how far the orcs have come. In my time we knew only harsh survival, fleeing one set of shackles after another.
:I know that the memory of my sacrifice has been wielded for many causes, but I do not fault anyone for fighting for a brighter future for orcs. Everything that happened since my death has led to this moment of unity!
:If I have one regret, it is that I was not alive to guide [[Garrosh Hellscream|my son]] down a better path. Let his story be a warning to those that remain.

;Broxigar the Red
:Hail, <name>! The first seeker of true honor!
:You and I are alike. Willing to put our lives on the line to protect what matters. The orcs, the Horde, Azeroth itself.
:Continue being the exemplar of honor and might to our people. Never abandon your willingness to fight until the end.
:Lok-tar Ogar! I will see you again on the [[Shadowlands|other side]], and will look forward to the stories of your victories.

;Durotan
:Hail, <name>! The first seeker of true honor!
:I am finally able to see this land called "Durotar" with my own eyes! I am ever honored that my son chose this name for the new home of the orcs.
:Thank you for being his friend and ally. He has certainly had his trials, but has nevertheless found happiness and family.

;Draka, to non-[[Necrolord Covenant|Necrolords]]
:Hail, <name>! The first seeker of true honor!
:You are a <class> of many virtues, bravery and tenacity most of all. I am glad that Go'el has your aid.
:The return of the Kosh'harg represents a turning point for our people. After our long suffering, a brighter future has finally been reached.

;Draka, to Necrolords
:Hail, <name>! The first seeker of true honor!
:It is good to see you again, my friend! I am not at all surprised that you have had a hand in bringing about this glorious day. There is no finer choice of orc for the first completion of the rite.
:The return of the Kosh'harg represents a turning point for our people. After our long suffering, a brighter future has finally been reached.

Upon returning to Razor Hill:
:{{Text|say|Durak|Did that really just happen? Father speaks of Saurfang often. He misses him.}}

Turn in to Aggralan. After the quest, for the duration of the rest of the questline, the player can deliver Varok's messages to Eitrigg:
:{{Gossip|Saurfang had a message for you.}}
:{{Text|say|Eitrigg|Hah! Only in death would he admit it. Ah, I miss him.}}

And to Thrall:
:{{Gossip|Saurfang had a message for you.}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Saurfang! What was his message?}}
:''Thrall chuckles.''
:{{Text|say|Thrall|I am glad you did too, old friend.}}
