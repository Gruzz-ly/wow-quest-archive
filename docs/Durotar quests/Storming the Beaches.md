== Objectives ==
Kill 11 Foaming Sea Elementals.
*[[Foaming Sea Elemental]] slain x11

== Description ==
Now that those humans are out of our hair for a bit, we can move on to more pressing matters.

The cataclysm utterly decimated Durotar's eastern coast. You saw the wreckage that it made of Tiragarde. The devastation was even worse on the coast to the east of here.

After the first wave, the beach was overtaken by angry elementals that came from the sea. I sent grunts to take care of it, but the onslaught was too much. I'm guessing you'll have a little more luck than they did.

== Rewards ==
You will receive: {{cost||3|50}}

==Progress==
Return to the beach and finish the job!

== Completion ==
The scent of the sea hangs about you, <name>.  Your efforts may have purchased another day for Razor Hill.

I will pass word of your deeds up my chain of command.  You have our gratitude.

== Notes ==
This quest should be done along with [[Shipwreck Searching]]. You will come across [[Injured Razor Hill Grunt]]s while doing these quests. Although they will '''not''' have an exclamation mark above their heads, speak to one to begin the side quest [[Loss Reduction]].
