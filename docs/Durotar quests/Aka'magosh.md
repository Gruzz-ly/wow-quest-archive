'''Aka'magosh''' concludes the [[Heritage of Draenor]] storyline.

==Objectives==
Observe the formal closing of the [[Kosh'harg]].
*Kosh'harg Closed{{Co|52.25|43.45|Durotar}}

==Description==
The Kosh'harg has been a great success, in no small part thanks to you, <name>.

All that is left is for [[Aggralan|Aggra]] to perform the ceremony to bring the festival to an official close.

I wish to speak to the crowd before we all disperse again, on some things long overdue in being said.

==Rewards==
The following will be cast on you:
:{{Abilities|Heritage of Draenor|id=399753|Unlock the appearances of the [[Heritage of Draenor]] on completion of the Orc Heritage storyline.|icon=inv_armor_orc_d_01_belt}}

You will also receive:
*[[Clan Banner]]
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
A new age has dawned for our people, <name>.

I could never have imagined bringing you in on my old fool's crusade would have led to this moment.

We had this armor specially made, just for you. You have more than earned it.

Hail, <name>, Champion of the Orcs!

==Notes==
On accept, the player is granted a 30-minute buff counting down to the end of the festival:
:{{Abilities|Kosh'harg Ending|id=407382|The Kosh'harg has officially come to a close. Soon the orcs will disperse from Razor Hill.|icon=achievement_raid_soo_orgrimmar_outdoors}}

A cutscene immediately plays:
{{#ev:youtube|N5kCPwoYRNo}}
:''From in front of the burrow, Thrall addresses the crowd.''
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Thank you all for honoring us with your presence here.}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|When our people came to [[Azeroth]] from [[Draenor]], ours was not an easy road.}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|And along the way, many of our ancient traditions were lost.}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|But the time has come to remember the rites of old...}}
:''Thrall looks to the side, down at [[Durak]] (who salutes), [[Rehze]], and the player character.''
:{{Text|say|Thrall|...and to build new traditions that honor our proud legacy.}}
:''The player character walks up next to Thrall.''
:{{Text|say|Thrall|This champion is the first to complete the new rite of [[om'gora]].}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Let their footsteps be followed for generations to come.}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|Lok-tar!}}
:''The player raises their fist and the crowd cheers. Thrall steps aside as Aggralan walks forward.''
:{{Text|say|Farseer Aggralan|And so, we bring the first Kosh'harg of Azeroth to an end.}}
:''She raises her hands and starts channeling air magic, causing many orc spirits to appear among the crowd. Most of the spirits are generic, with one exception: as [[Gorgonna]] looks to the side, the spirit of her sister [[Conqueror Krenna|Krenna]] appears next to her.''
:{{Text|say|Farseer Aggralan|May the honored ancestors watch over us all, until next we meet.}}
:''She releases a blast of air magic, removing her totems and causing the spirits to fade away.''

On the other side of the cutscene, the Kosh'harg has returned to its previous phase. Turn in to Eitrigg. On completion, the clan leaders salute the player:
:{{Text|yell|Thega Graveblade|Hail, <name>! Champion of the orcs!}}
:{{Text|yell|Gorfax Angerfang|Hail, <name>! Champion of the orcs!}}
:{{Text|yell|Gorgonna|Hail, <name>! Champion of the orcs!}}
:{{Text|yell|Jorin Deadeye|Hail, <name>! Champion of the orcs!}}

Congratulations! You have now completed the orc heritage questline and earned three color variants of the [[Heritage of Draenor]] set. As soon as the Kosh'harg Ending buff expires, Razor Hill returns to normal. In the meantime, all of the visitors have the same gossip text as before, except for Thrall:
:You have done well, <name>. I have not seen the orcs so hopeful about the future since we liberated the [[internment camp]]s.
:Others are now lining up to complete the om'gora themselves, but they are fools if they think they will go before me! I will be the second orc to complete it!
:And in a few years, Durak will be old enough as well. He is very excited.
