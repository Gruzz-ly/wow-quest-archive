==Objectives==
Speak with Jaz the Reborn about relaxation, then relax by [[Southfury River]] in the [[Northern Barrens]].
* Speak to [[Jaz the Reborn]]
* Relax (0/100%)
*Return to Jaz the Reborn at the Southfury River in the Northern Barrens.

==Description==
Love is a gift, yes. But it is also a gift that you can give yourself.

Sometimes, the best way to love yourself is simply to relax.

I met a troll across the Southfury River who seems particularly wise in this regard. Perhaps you could ask her for insights in the art of relaxation.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
True love is letting ya guard down. Let yourself relax, you'll see what I mean.

==Completion==
Ya feel renewed, don't ya? We all got ta relax from da problems in our lives.

Relaxin' has helped me re-discover who I was. Changed my whole life! I used to have tusks out to here and a mohawk, bwahaha! What a stupid boy I was.

Did ya discover anyting about yourself?

==Notes==
Head to the west beyond the [[Southfury River]] and speak with Jaz at {{Co|71.04|13.94|Northern Barrens}}:
On approaching Jaz
:{{Text|say|[[Jaz the Reborn]]|Welcome to da calmer side of da river!}}
{{book|content=
:{{Gossip|quest=|Teach me how to relax.}}
::I can't teach you dat. That's something only ya own heart can teach.

::Spend some time by da river. You'll know what I mean when ya let your guard down and stop trying to solve ya problems like it's some sort of grand quest.
