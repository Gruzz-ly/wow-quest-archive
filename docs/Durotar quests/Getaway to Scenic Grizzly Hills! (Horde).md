==Objectives==
Take the [[Scenic Getaway Portal]] to [[Grizzly Hills]] to pick a bouquet of flowers for Laverne.
* Portal taken to Grizzly Hills (Optional)
* [[Grizzly Hills Flower|Flowers picked]] (12)
* Take the return portal to Orgrimmar (Optional)
* Bouquet brought to [[Laverne Cameron]]

==Description==
Good morrow! Today's special portal is a magical getaway to the majestic forests of [[Northrend]]!

Although perhaps I could beg you for a favor. You seem the adventurous type.

I could use your help in delivering some flowers from Grizzly hills to a beautiful woman named Laverne.

I would do it myself but... Well, you see, she is rather intimidating in her beauty.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost||20}}
* 1,400 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Love Token]]

==Progress==
The mage conjuring portals?

<Laverne giggles.>

Let me see.

==Completion==
This gala is quite marvelous for making new discoveries...

<Laverne idly picks at the flowers while staring in the direction of Aurora.>

==Notes==
Take the [[Scenic Getaway Portal]]:
:{{Gossip|quest=|A frosty hike in the Grizzly Hills.}}

On the other side of the portal, head past the [[Path of Iron]] toward the forest with a river where [[Gala Attendee]]s are fishing or gathering herbs. Start picking [[Lavenbloom]]s, [[Lush Lavenbloom]]s, [[Sugar Orchid]]s, [[Lush Sugar Orchid]]s, [[Orange Illicium]]s, and [[Lush Orange Illicium]]s. The plants may summon hostile [[Irritated Worker Bee]]s and [[Anglerweed]]s and friendly [[Curious Critter]]s.

Once enough are collected, take the portal back and speak with Laverne:
:{{Gossip|quest=|These flowers are for you.}}
::For me? From who?

::{{Gossip|Aurora Vabsley.}}
