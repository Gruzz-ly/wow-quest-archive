==Objectives==
Deliver [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]]'s deployment orders.
* Speak with [[Jaina Proudmoore]]
* Speak with [[Mayla Highmountain]]
* Speak with [[Shandris Feathermoon]]

==Description==
[[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]] maintains that the key to taking [[Orgrimmar]] is to exploit its multiple points of entry. He led the city's defenses for years, and knows its vulnerabilities better than anyone. We are spread thin as it is, but I trust his judgment in this matter.

We must also fortify [[Thunder Bluff]] in case [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] plans to assault it while our forces are committed here.

Deliver these deployment orders to our [[officer]]s. We will assail all of Orgrimmar's gates at once while also defending Thunder Bluff.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
So much rests on the outcome of this battle.

==Completion==
Our forces are in place. All that is left is to begin the battle.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Genn, we need you and your best soldiers to flank the city from the western gate.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|And leave you here, unguarded? With them?}}
:{{text|say|Varok Saurfang|If I wanted to harm him, I'd have done it in the [[Stormwind Stockade|Stockades]].}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|No one knows Orgrimmar's defenses better than Saurfang. We need to trust each other if we are to succeed.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|Very well. But the Banshee is clever. Dividing our forces might play right into her hands.}}

Jaina is to the east of Anduin's location, standing with [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]] and a group of Nightborne and 7th Legion battlemages.

;Speaking with Jaina
:It is time to end this cycle of hatred.

{{Gossip|I have deployment orders from Saurfang and King Wrynn.}}

:{{Text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|First Arcanist, we are to shield our forces from magical assault as they lay siege to the city.}}
:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|A wise decision. We can do so more effectively from higher ground.}}
:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Lord Admiral, might I ask about the spellcraft you employed at [[Battle for Lordaeron|Lordaeron]]? [[Proudmoore flagship|The levitating warship]]?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Would you believe me if I told you it was a Kul Tiran trade secret?}}
:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Summoning the ship, perhaps... but as for the enchanted cannons...}}

Shandris is at the center of the army line, next to [[Lor'themar Theron]].

;Speaking with Shandris
At last, Sylvanas will face retribution for Teldrassil

{{Gossip|Saurfang and King Wrynn have assigned your forces to the northern gate.}}

:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|So we are to strike from the north. A sound plan... but there is no telling what treachery Sylvanas has in store for us.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|She fought beside you for many years, both in life and in undeath. You must know her well.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Perhaps I did, long ago. But now...}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Hmm... Our forces are few in number. We must make use of the surrounding terrain when we assault the gate.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|The sentinels have made use of that terrain for millennia. Our knowledge of the land was old when the [[Farstriders]] were young.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Yes, of course.}}

Mayla is at the rear, flanked by [[Highmountain Skyrider]]s.
;Speaking with Mayla
The [[Burning Legion|Legion]], the [[naga]], now each other... How much must war cost us before we bring it to an end?

{{Gossip|High Chieftain, you have been tasked with defending the skies above Thunder Bluff.}}

:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|There is little my eagle riders can do while Sylvanas controls the skies. But we can still defend Thunder Bluff.}}
:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|[[Ji Firepaw|Ji]] is already there, tending to [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]]'s wounds. He said he has seen [[Siege of Orgrimmar|Orgrimmar under siege]] once before, and does not wish to relive it.}}
:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|We will stand beside our tauren kin and await further orders from Saurfang. [[Earth Mother]] watch over us all.}}

Return to Anduin.
