==Objectives==
[[File:The Kosh'harg - intro.jpg|thumb|The saddled wind riders in the Valley of Strength.]]
Travel to the [[Kosh'harg]] in [[Razor Hill]] and begin the [[om'gora]], the rite of honor.
*Travel to the Kosh'harg with [[Aggra]]'s family (Optional){{Co|52|79.3|Orgrimmar}}
*Talk to Farseer Aggralan to begin the Om'gora{{Co|52.21|43|Durotar}}

==Description==
The Kosh'harg will be held in Razor Hill. [[Thrall|Go'el]] and [[Eitrigg]] are gathering the [[Clan#Orcish clan system|clans]] as we speak.

We will have to part ways for now. You must begin mentally preparing yourself for the om'gora--the rite of honor. It is my task to make sure it is a worthy challenge, even for you.

I will call our [[Wyvern|wind riders]] to carry my family to the Kosh'harg. You may travel with them, or meet us there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
*[[Money]]
*[[XP]]

==Completion==
Your om'gora has begun. May the spirits guide you to victory.

==Notes==
[[File:The Kosh'harg - ride.jpg|thumb|Flying to Razor Hill.]]
On accept, Aggra, [[Durak]], and [[Rehze]] walk out of the [[Broken Tusk]] into the [[Valley of Strength]], where an [[Armored Wind Rider (Heritage of Draenor)|Armored Wind Rider]] and two [[Grand Wind Rider]]s are waiting.
:{{Text|say|Aggra|<Name>, I have much to attend before the Kosh'harg. If you would not mind, perhaps you could take Durak and Rehze to Razor Hill?}}
:{{Text|say|Aggra|I am certain Durak has much to say to you.}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|Mother!}}
:{{Text|say|Aggra|I will see you at the Kosh'harg, my friend.}}

Aggra mounts one of the Grand Wind Riders and flies away. The player can choose to fly to Razor Hill on their own, but if not, they can talk to the Armored Wind Rider:
:<The wyvern patiently awaits its rider. Will you fly to Razor Hill with Durak and Rehze?>

:{{Gossip|<Ride the Wind Rider to Razor Hill.>}}

The player mounts the wyvern while Durak and Rehze hop up on the remaining Grand Wind Rider. The wyverns take off and fly south.
:{{Text|say|Durak|A new rite of passage! Are you excited? I would be.}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|[[Drek'Thar]] said I'll know my path when I go through it myself. That I shouldn't worry.}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|But I'm not stupid. Everyone expects me to be a [[shaman]] like my parents!}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|What if the spirits don't call to me? What if I don't want to be a shaman? What then?}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|If I'm honest... I hope that watching you complete this rite will spark something in me.}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|Maybe you'll show me where I should go.}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|Um, no pressure though.}}
:{{Text|say|Durak|We're here! I'll watch Rehze. You should go find my mother!}}

The wind riders arrive at the northern entrance to Razor Hill and eject their passengers. Durak and Rehze remain standing where they land.

During this questline, Razor Hill is placed in a special phase for the Kosh'harg. Feast tables (empty for now) fill the central crossroads, large piles of "Stack of Supplies" objects have appeared here and there, and the banners of the major clans ([[Blackrock clan|Blackrock]], [[Bleeding Hollow clan|Bleeding Hollow]], [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]], [[Frostwolf clan|Frostwolf]], [[Shattered Hand clan|Shattered Hand]], and [[Warsong clan|Warsong]]) have been put up around the area. In addition to Razor Hill's normal inhabitants, an impressive number of named visitors (listed further down the page) have come to attend the festival, including almost every living orc character of note. Most of them have unique dialogue (also listed further down the page).

[[File:The Kosh'harg - chieftains.jpg|thumb|The chieftains assembled before Farseer Aggralan at the burrow.]]
Aggra, now called [[Farseer Aggralan]], stands in front of the town's [[burrow]] with the leaders of the major clans—[[Eitrigg]] (Blackrock), [[Jorin Deadeye]] (Bleeding Hollow), [[Gorgonna]] (Warsong), [[Thega Graveblade]] (Shattered Hand), [[Thrall]] (Frostwolf), and [[Gorfax Angerfang]] (Dragonmaw)—assembled in front of her. Speak to Aggralan:
:<Aggra has changed into ceremonial garb and paint. She looks at you sternly, but briefly flashes a kind smile. She is now officiating your rite.>

:Hail, <name>. The clans have been called to the Kosh'harg, and have gathered to witness your om'gora. Are you ready to begin?

:{{Gossip|I am ready.}}
:{{Gossip|Let's skip the formalities. {{Text|yell|<Skip conversation.>}}}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Aggralan|I, Farseer Aggralan of the Frostwolves, call to the clans. Are they assembled?}}
:{{Text|say|Thrall|The clans have assembled! We answer the call!}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Aggralan|I call to our ancestors--may they bless this gathering of old and new.}}
[[File:The Kosh'harg - Aggralan's totems.jpg|thumb|Aggra with her totems.]]
:''Aggralan summons the [[Totem of Fire]], [[Totem of Earth]], [[Totem of Air]], [[Totem of Water]], and [[Totem of Spirits (Heritage of Draenor)|Totem of Spirits]] around her. Durak and Rehze approach and stand next to Eitrigg.''
:{{Text|say|Farseer Aggralan|The first Kosh'harg of Azeroth has begun!}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Aggralan|And with this gathering, a new rite of passage--the om'gora. This champion has earned the honor of being the first to attempt it.}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Aggralan|Let the spirits guide you, <name>. May you walk with honor.}}
:''The chieftains walk away into the Razor Hill Barracks.''

Turn in to Aggralan. On completion:
:{{Text|say|Farseer Aggralan|The om'gora--a rite of honor, earned by three blessings. Of the clan, of the land, and of the ancestors.}}
:{{Text|say|Farseer Aggralan|When all three have been earned, you will understand what it means to be an orc.}}

After the quest, Aggralan gets new gossip text:
:May the spirits guide you to success in your om'gora.

===Dialogue===
''Sorted in alphabetical order for ease of reading.''

;[[Arcweaver Kashra]]
:I, like many other orcs, was disconnected from my clan when my parents were taken into [[internment camp]]s.

:They were [[Frostwolf clan|Frostwolf]], and named me for the venerable [[Mother Kashur]]. I know little else.

:I will use this opportunity to try and reconnect with my heritage.

;[[Ariok]]
:I hope it was not a mistake that I came. I wanted to support my father's dream to restore the Kosh'harg, but everyone here is... staring.

:{{Gossip|What happened to you?}}
::During [[Assault on the Dark Portal|our incursion]] into [[Tanaan Jungle]] to defeat the [[Iron Horde]], I interrupted the {{Au|Bleeding Hollow clan|Bleeding Hollow}}'s [[blood magic]] ritual, stealing its power for myself.

::It granted me great strength, at the cost of this hulking, aberrant form. I have... avoided contact with most of the Horde since.

::So far my father and I have found no cure, but we have not yet tried asking the Bleeding Hollow here for help. Jorin Deadeye is attending the Kosh'harg, yes?

;[[Arnak Fireblade]]
:[[Mordak Darkfist|Mordak]] and I have come to represent the [[Burning Blade clan]]. We are among its last living members loyal to the Horde.

:But we were not expecting [[Lantresor of the Blade]] to come! He is a legend among our clan!

:Will you... introduce us? He is quite intimidating...

;[[Boss Magor]]
:I have been asked to run logistics for the Kosh'harg, and make sure everything is ready in time for the feast.

:There's still a lot to do! [[Orc Peon (Heritage of Draenor)|You peons]] had best GET TO IT!

;[[Captain Galvangar]]
:How does Thrall stand the heat in Durotar? I feel like I'm boiling alive!

;[[Durak]]
:Wow, I've never seen so many orcs in one place before! This is amazing!

;[[Eitrigg]]
:It warms my heart that so many orcs have joined us for the Kosh'harg. Thank you for helping me achieve this.

;[[Far'kul Flametongue]]
:Step right up! I have all the finest herbs and spices from [[Azeroth]] and beyond!

:Some of these were... challenging to procure, but you'll find none finer!

;[[Garona Halforcen]]
:Greetings, <name>. I decided the first kosh'harg of Azeroth was an event worthy of coming out of seclusion for.

:I am intrigued that so many orcs answered the call, and that none of them are fighting each other.

:Not yet, anyway.

;[[Gorfax Angerfang]]
:The [[Dragonmaw clan|Dragonmaw]] have had many disagreements with Thrall in the past. I hope this Kosh'harg will do much to unite us again.

;[[Gorgonna]]
:I am honored to be representing my clan at the first kosh'harg of Azeroth! I only wish... I wish [[Conqueror Krenna|my sister]] were still here to see it.

:{{Gossip|I did not know you were from the [[Warsong clan]].}}
::Aye. I fought in the [[Warsong Offensive]] to honor my family's memory.

::My parents were Warsong, and chose to bring my sister and I through the [[Dark Portal]] as children. [[Grommash Hellscream|Grommash]] did not approve of this, and exiled us from his camp.

::The four of us wandered the wilderness, eventually finding ourselves ambushed by human soldiers in [[Arathi Highlands|Arathi]]. My parents were slain, and Krenna and I were thrown in [[Durnholde Keep|Durnholde]].

::{{Gossip|And then what happened?}}
:::After the camps were freed, Krenna and I followed Thrall to Durotar. We lost contact with our relatives still in the Warsong. We became soldiers of the Horde, and nothing else. We quickly climbed the ranks. After Krenna's death, the Horde was all I had.

:::After the fall of Garrosh Hellscream, my uncle [[Gargok]] reached out, wishing to make our family whole again. The Warsong were shattered by what Garrosh had become. I went to them in [[Ashenvale]], and found a new place to belong. I eventually proved my strength to all of them through a [[mak'gora]], and now I lead the Warsong.

:::I will never allow us to lose our honor again.

;[[Gregor]]
:I do hope the Dragonmaw can find a true place within the Horde after all these years.

:There has been more than enough strife between the orcs. May it finally be done.

;[[Herezegor Flametusk]]
:I cannot believe that Thrall would extend an olive branch to the Dragonmaw like this. After our years in the [[Dark Horde]], and [[Warlord Zaela]] commanding our forces under [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]]?

:This must be some sort of trick!

;[[High Warlord Cromush]]
:I feel out of my element here, <name>.

:I would much rather be leading these orcs in the field of battle, instead of rubbing elbows at some party. Pah.

;[[Innkeeper Grosk]]
:I haven't seen Razor Hill this busy since [[Battle at the Gates of Orgrimmar|the last time]] someone tried to invade Orgrimmar!

;[[Jorin Deadeye]]
:This is my first time visiting Durotar and Orgrimmar. I should have come much sooner.

;[[Kolgar Flameguard]]
:I wish [[Duroz Scaletaker|Duroz]] was here to see this... so many orcs from all over, together.

:Though I wonder if he would have avoided his former clan. The least I can do is inform them of his passing.

;[[Kyl'kahn]]
:Don't mind [[Cort Gorestein|us]]. We always get to arguing about which brews are better when we get together like this.

;[[Lantresor of the Blade]]
:So this is Azeroth, and this is the "New Horde", hm? The orcs have made a decent home for themselves here.

:It appears there is even room for us [[half-breed]]s at this new Kosh'harg. I see Garona, and the [[Mok'nathal]].

:I hope [[Blackhand]] is rolling in his grave.

;[[Leoroxx]]
:I was surprised when Thrall reached out with an invitation to the Kosh'harg. The Mok'nathal have never been included before--we were considered half-breeds by the [[Old Horde]]. Lesser than true orcs.

:In our isolation in [[Outland]], I did not realize how much had truly changed. It may be time for an earnest discussion with [[Rexxar|my son]].

;[[Mahka]]
:Lok-tar, <name>.

:Thank you for the part you played in bringing the orcs together like this.

;[[Mallia the Seer]]
:In the spirit of fellowship among orcs, [[Artesh]] and I have been extended an invitation to join the [[Earthen Ring]] by the new Farseer, Aggralan.

:So the Frostwolf of Outland says, but old prejudices are not so easily put down among the orcs of Azeroth.

:I will spend time scrying the outcomes before we decide. Despite our personal feelings, we must do as the spirits will.

;[[Mankrik]]
:Being here among friends, a real community gathering, with Mahka at my side...

:This feels good. For a long time, I didn't know if I would ever feel good again.

;[[Marud]]
:So few of us have chosen the path of the [[mage]]. I am glad to see [[Arcweaver Kashra|Kashra]] flourishing.

:She was almost not given the chance. It was only through Thrall's intervention that the remaining [[Arcweaver]]s were not executed for treason after the [[Siege of Orgrimmar]].

:He saw potential in orcs able to wield the [[arcane]], an area where the Alliance and their [[Kirin Tor]] have always been dominant. He thought it a waste to dispose of what could be a valuable resource.

:I will forever be grateful for his compassion and wisdom.

;[[Nazgrel]]
:It is good to be among Frostwolves again! My station in [[Thrallmar]] has kept me away for too long.

:And Thrall's children are here! This is my first time meeting the younglings. I expect great things from those two!

;[[Nazgrim]], to non-death knights
:Hail, <name>. This is quite the gathering you have put together.

:I have not spoken to many of these orcs since... the events that led to my death.

:But I suppose I am not the only one out of place here, and we all appear welcome. We will see if the living can let bygones be bygones.

;Nazgrim, to death knights
:Hail, Deathlord. This is quite the gathering you have put together.

:I have not spoken to many of these orcs since... the events that led to my death.

:But I suppose I am not the only one out of place here, and we all appear welcome. They even accept you as their champion!

:We will see if the living can let bygones be bygones.

;[[Nula the Butcher]]
:Hail, <name>! I have the best and freshest meats all the way from Outland to sell. May they aid you in your om'gora!

;[[Orgnil Soulscar]]
:We have the best seat in the house!

;[[Raider Jhash]]
:Hail, <name>!

:We [[Raider]]s salute you!

;[[Rehgar Earthfury]]
*Non-shaman gossip
:Ah, the orc of the hour. Throm'ka, <name>.

:The spirits are watching with anticipation. I know you will honor us with your best effort.

*Shaman gossip
Ah, the orc of the hour. Throm'ka, Farseer.

The spirits tell me you are certain to succeed in your om'gora today. I know they speak true, for you have proven your might to the Earthen Ring time and time again.

;[[Relka Bloodfyre]]
:Ah, you are <name>, the one who will complete the new rite today. Most of these orcs are too afraid to approach me.

:I am Relka, the last [[Mag'har orc|Mag'har]] of the [[Shadowmoon clan]]. The others keep their distance, not wishing to converse with one of [[Ner'zhul]]'s fallen. I do not blame them. But I have not come to reclaim my clan's place at the Kosh'harg, or to re-fight old wars.

:I have come because I have heard that there are now [[Lok'osh|some among the orcs]] who listen to the songs of [[Light|life]] and [[Void|shadow]]. The mysteries of the cosmos are ones that the Shadowmoon have mastered.

:If nothing else, I wish to share my dead clan's knowledge with the young where I can, and try to steer those who seek to use the darkness away from disaster.

[[Priest]]s have an additional dialogue option:
:{{Gossip|We call ourselves "Priests" here.}}
::And how quickly you have gained power, <name>! I hope you have not made any... unwise alliances to ascend with such haste.

::<She grins at you. Her dead eye seems to sparkle under her hood.>

::I believe there is much we can teach each other, Priest. I hope to see you again after the Kosh'harg.

;[[Rexxar]]
:I did not know Thrall was going to invite the Mok'nathal to the Kosh'harg.

:They deserve their place here, and I am glad to see them among the orcs, but... I have not spoken to [[Leoroxx|my father]] since I left to join the Horde all those years ago.

:He was not ready to accept me back as his son when I was last in Outland. I do not know if he is ready now.

:This will be a difficult day for us.

;[[Ritssyn Flamescowl]], to non-warlocks
:It is not often that we [[warlock]]s are invited to such prestigious affairs. We are used to skulking in the shadows, never acknowledged for our efforts in keeping Azeroth and the Horde safe.

;Ritssyn Flamescowl, to warlocks
:Greetings to you, Netherlord.

:It is not often that we warlocks are invited to such prestigious affairs. We are used to skulking in the shadows, never acknowledged for our efforts in keeping Azeroth and the Horde safe.

:I think we have you to thank for that changing.

;[[Rokaro]]
:Well met, <name>. I am pleased to see so many orcs together, including the Mok'nathal.

:It has been some time since I have seen my friend, Rexxar. I look forward to catching up.

;[[Scout Manslayer]]
:Lok-tar, <name>! We orcs of Orgrimmar are proud of everything you have accomplished.

;[[Shokia]]
:<Shokia nods curtly in your direction. She looks at your{{Sic}} with steely trepidation.>

:<Name>. I hope my presence here is welcome.

:{{Gossip|Where have you been all this time?}}
::After [[Garrosh Hellscream|Hellscream]]'s death, I wished to be alone. So I wandered.

::I took mercenary contracts where I could. Plenty of work out there for someone good with a rifle. Even fell in with pirates for a time.

::But, truthfully, I missed Orgrimmar. I missed the Horde. The kosh'harg seemed like a decent opportunity to return home.

::{{Gossip|Do you regret siding with Garrosh?}}
:::I...

:::<She pauses, lost in thought. Her face hardens.>

:::No. I don't.

:::Do you know what it's like to believe in a cause so fully that you would die for it, only for the person you thought embodied that cause to be [[Siege of Orgrimmar|utterly defeated]]? [[And Justice for Thrall|Twice]]?

:::I believed I was doing the right thing. The orcs deserved a better future, and Hellscream believed he was leading us to it. He was not simply using us for this{{Sic}} own gains.

:::{{Gossip|But it came at the cost of the rest of the Horde.}}
::::<She has no rebuke for that. She scowls.>

::::Fine. You are right. I did not know his glorious future required the sacrifice of every other race, including my friends. I did not know he would allow [[Y'Shaarj|an old god]]{{Sic}} to corrupt both the orcs and himself. But by then, it was too late and I was in too deep to be wrong.

::::It doesn't matter. It's all over now. [[Warlord Zaela|Zaela]] is dead. Hellscream is dead. General Nazgrim... WAS dead.

::::I don't expect for it all to just be forgotten and forgiven. I just want the Horde back. The kosh'harg is for all orcs to come together, and that includes me.

;[[Silmara]]
:It is my hope that the Kosh'harg will show Leoroxx that the isolation of the Mok'nathal can finally end.

:The journey from Outland has ignited in me a desire to explore. If that runt Rexxar has seen all of Azeroth, so should I!

;[[Tactical Officer Kilrath]]
:I have not spent much time in Durotar or Orgrimmar. The landscape certainly is... striking.

;[[Thega Graveblade]]
:Do not worry, the [[Shattered Hand clan|Shattered Hand]] will make sure our festivities aren't interrupted by any of the Alliance spies lurking just outside.

:Oh yes, they're out there. Even if we are at peace, we still keep eyes on each other. It keeps us both honest.

;[[Thrall]]
:The Kosh'harg has begun! So many familiar faces that I have not seen in years!

;[[Thura]]
:Throm'ka, <name>. It is an honor to finally meet you. I am Thura of the [[Blackrock clan]].

:I will take this opportunity to speak with Eitrigg and his son. It has been far too many years since I have seen them. I do not remember Ariok being so... large.

;[[Zor Lonetree]]
:It is good to see Aggralan joining the ranks of the Farseers. She has more than proven herself.

:I look forward to seeing young Durak's growth as a shaman. He comes from powerful stock, that one!
