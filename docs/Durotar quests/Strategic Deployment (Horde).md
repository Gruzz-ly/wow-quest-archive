==Objectives==
Deliver [[Varok Saurfang|Saurfang]]'s deployment orders.
*Speak with [[First Arcanist Thalyssra]]
*Speak with [[Mayla Highmountain]]
*Speak with [[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]]

==Description==
For years, I guarded the gates of [[Orgrimmar]]. The city's greatest weakness has always been its multiple entrances. We should strike at all of them to seize victory.

[[Anduin Wrynn|Wrynn]] and I have drawn up orders for deployment. The [[mage]]s will cover our flank. [[Genn Greymane|Greymane]] will close in from the west, and the elves will take the north. We will send [[Mayla Highmountain|Mayla]] to reinforce [[Thunder Bluff]]'s defenses in case [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]] launches a counterattack.

Bring the orders to our [[Commander (rank)|commanders]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|23|40|}}
* 17,850 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If we do not win here, then we lose everything.

==Completion==
No matter what our strategy, taking Orgrimmar will be no easy task. I should know.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|Genn, we need you and your best soldiers to flank the city from the western gate.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|And leave you here, unguarded? With them?}}
:{{text|say|Varok Saurfang|If I wanted to harm him, I'd have done it in the [[Stormwind Stockade|Stockades]].}}
:{{text|say|Anduin Wrynn|No one knows Orgrimmar's defenses better than Saurfang. We need to trust each other if we are to succeed.}}
:{{text|say|Genn Greymane|Very well. But the Banshee is clever. Dividing our forces might play right into her hands.}}

Thalyssra is to the east of Saurfang's location, standing with [[Jaina Proudmoore]] and a group of Nightborne and 7th Legion battlemages.
:Never did I expect to fight in [[Nightfallen rebellion|another rebellion]]... least of all against the warchief.
{{Gossip|Saurfang has tasked you and the Lord Admiral with shielding our army against magical assault.}}

:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|A wise decision. We can do so more effectively from higher ground.}}
:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Lord Admiral, might I ask about the spellcraft you employed at [[Battle for Lordaeron|Lordaeron]]? [[Proudmoore flagship|The levitating warship]]?}}
:{{text|say|Lady Jaina Proudmoore|Would you believe me if I told you it was a Kul Tiran trade secret?}}
:{{text|say|First Arcanist Thalyssra|Summoning the ship, perhaps... but as for the enchanted cannons...}}

Lor'themar is at the center of the army line, next to [[Shandris Feathermoon]].
:Make no mistake, <name>. No matter the outcome, this battle will be a bloody one.
{{Gossip|Saurfang and King Wrynn have assigned your forces to the northern gate.}}

:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|So we are to strike from the north. A sound plan... but there is no telling what treachery Sylvanas has in store for us.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|She fought beside you for many years, both in life and in undeath. You must know her well.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Perhaps I did, long ago. But now...}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Hmm... Our forces are few in number. We must make use of the surrounding terrain when we assault the gate.}}
:{{text|say|Shandris Feathermoon|The sentinels have made use of that terrain for millennia. Our knowledge of the land was old when the [[Farstriders]] were young.}}
:{{text|say|Lor'themar Theron|Yes, of course.}}

Mayla is at the rear, flanked by [[Highmountain Skyrider]]s.
:The [[Burning Legion|Legion]], the [[naga]], now each other... How much must war cost us before we bring it to an end?
{{Gossip|High Chieftain, you have been tasked with defending the skies above Thunder Bluff.}}

:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|There is little my eagle riders can do while Sylvanas controls the skies. But we can still defend Thunder Bluff.}}
:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|[[Ji Firepaw|Ji]] is already there, tending to [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]]'s wounds. He said he has seen [[Siege of Orgrimmar|Orgrimmar under siege]] once before, and does not wish to relive it.}}
:{{text|say|Mayla Highmountain|We will stand beside our tauren kin and await further orders from Saurfang. [[Earth Mother]] watch over us all.}}

Return to Saurfang.
