==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Shrinekeeper Qanosh.jpg|Shrinekeeper Qanosh and Earthrender Ku'siva|What are Shrinekeeper Qanosh and Earthrender Ku'siva guarding?}}
Kill Shrinekeeper Qanosh and Earthrender Ku'siva.
* [[Shrinekeeper Qanosh]] slain {{co|31.0|45.7|Zaralek Cavern}}
* [[Earthrender Ku'siva]] slain
* Disturbance investigated

==Description==
[[File:Take Out the Head.jpg|thumb|Qanosh and Ku'siva]]
While you and [[Ebyssian]] were away, I had an epiphany.

That corrupted caldera is at the center of the [[Zaqali tribe|Zaqali]] elder's slumbering prison and their war camps. Whatever is located within is the key to the [[Primalists|Primalist's]] plans.

It is lightly guarded as well. Only a Primalist and a Zaqali priest. If we take them out, we can discover what I believe will be the truth behind all of this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
<Ebyssian looks between Sabellian and the caldera, his breath unsteady.>

What... What has Fyrakk done?

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|A quick and decisive strike, and then we have access to the caldera unobserved.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Then let us make haste before we are discovered.}}
:''Sabellian and Ebyssian join the party.''

Head south to find Ku'siva and Qanosh:
:{{text|say|Earthrender Ku'siva|Fyrakk already awakened two of ya elders. He'll get to de last one. Be patient.}}
:{{text|say|Shrinekeeper Qanosh|You speak to us of patience? We have waited centuries for our elder's freedom. Your Incarnate must fulfill the bargain!}}

Aggro them. Ebyssian and Sabellian will tank. Once the fight finishes, a cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|5PYRrInW5Fk}}
:''Sabellian, Ebyssian, and the champion are walking away from Ku'siva and Qanosh. Suddenly the earth starts shaking.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|What is that? There! In the caldera.}}
:''A great dome of lava rises from the center of the Caldera.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Fyrakk!}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|He is consuming...}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Shadowflame?!}}
:''Fyrakk pops out of the lava dome.''
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|I smell the blood of dragons...}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|Begone worms!}}
:''Fyrakk winds up a breath attack. Sabellian instantly pops a shield in an attempt to defend himself, but it does not hold against the might of a Shadowflame-infused Incarnate.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Ahhhhhhhhhh!}}
:''Ebyssian runs forward and shifts to dragon form to protect the champion.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Sabellian is wounded! Champion! We must flee!}}
:''Ebyssian runs forward to Sabellian. After a cut, Ebyssian is flying away, holding Sabellian and the champion in his claws. Fyrakk tracks Ebyssian's escape but does not fire off another attack.''
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|Fly away little dragons.}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|I will master what your flight could not control.}}

After the cutscene ends, Ebyssian keeps flying east out of the caldera, then lands in a protected spot and shifts back to his visage.

Ebyssian has new gossip:
:We must save Sabellian!
:{{gossip|Should we go get help?}}
:There is no time.
:Sabellian's burn is severe. The shadowflame's corruption has already begun to take root, and it will spread further with every moment that we waste.
:In the time that it would take to return to Loamm, Sabellian would already be lost to the darkness.
:We will have to help him with what we have available here.
