==Objectives==
Use the Ancient Memories to teach others or yourself how to forge the parts needed for your new artifact. You must use [[Work Orders]] to get the components from your allies.
* [[Reclaimed Gauntlet Chassis]]
* [[Immaculate Coalescing Dracothyst]]
* [[Inspired Order Recalibrator]]
* Legendary recipes taught with Memories of the Oathbinder
* [[Ancient Memories]] (provided)

==Description==
You must go now and seek aid to create the key components to forge a new glove.

Essence of Order is normally difficult to find, but the memories you have acquired will allow you to recover them at many locations.

This new glove will be one to empower your allies and your community... which means you will have to rely on others to aid you in this.

Take the memories you've recovered and use them to teach others how to craft these parts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have you recovered all the items? You will have to request the aid of your fellow adventurers to create all the pieces.

==Completion==
Fine work! You've gone through great lengths to craft these individual parts.

Now we must uncover the last part to bring it all together.

The essence of the first black dragon aspect.

==Notes==
When you accept the quest:
:{{text|say|Nozdormu|I wish you luck in your journey to forge these parts. I will be investigating what is needed to imbue it with the power the dracthyr need to truly excel.}}
