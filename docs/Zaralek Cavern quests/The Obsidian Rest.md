==Objectives==
Gather information and resources at the [[Obsidian Rest]].
* [[Flight Master's Report]] obtained {{co|51.1|26.3|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Help requested from [[Tzashivak]] {{co|51.4|25.6|Zaralek Cavern}}
* [[Enchanted Spying Glass|Spying Glass]] used {{co|50.7|25.2|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
It is a miracle this outpost survived so long after [[Neltharion]]'s... disappearance. 

For weeks now local scouts have reported increased [[djaradin]] activity in the area. They are amassing an army, and they are also becoming increasingly aggressive in their efforts to expand their territory.

We must take every possible precaution and try to understand our enemy's motivations.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Progress==
These are trying times for all of us.

==Completion==
We must discuss what you have learned, <name>.

==Notes==
[[File:Flight Master's Report.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Flight Master's Report]]]]
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Before we enter this conflict, we must gather any information and resources available to us.}}

The [[Flight Master's Report]] is on a barrel a few yards from [[Keskos]], the flight master. Interact with it to pick it up:
:{{text|emote|Flight Master Keskos nods silently at you, her gaze fixed on the sky.}}

It reads:
{{book|Flight Master's Report|content=
[[Battlefield Ruins]]: Aerial Report

The skies above the Battlefield Ruins are a death trap. 

Anyone who comes too close risks being blasted out of the air by the djaradin ballistae or elemental magic. 

Until the aerial blockade is breached, our options are very limited.

[[File:The Obsidian Rest - Tzashivak and Kasztan.jpg|thumb|[[Tzashivak]] and [[Kasztan]]]]
Just to the northeast, [[Tzashivak]], the general goods vendor, is standing next to [[Kasztan]] and two Blacktalon assassins. Speak with her:
:We stand united with the Black Dragonflight.
:{{gossip|quest=|We need any help we can get to stop the djaradin.}}
:{{text|say|Tzashivak|You're in luck. I recently came into possession of many... incendiary devices. I'll send them along.}}
:''Kasztan runs off in the direction of Ebonhorn.''

[[File:Enchanted Spying Glass.jpg|thumb|Enchanted Spying Glass]]
Further north is the Enchanted Spying Glass. Interact with it to show a cutscene:
:''The spyglass shows a wide angle of [[Elders' Gift]], with [[Warchanter Ronvanth]] addressing a group of djaradin.''
:{{text|say|Warchanter Ronvath|Our Elder was taken from us by the dragons long ago. Imprisoned in Aberrus, they await.}}
:''The spyglass zooms in to get a closer shot of Ronvath.''
:{{text|say|Warchanter Ronvath|But the djaradin have not forgotten, and we will soon breach that prison and free them.}}

On return, Kasztan is still standing by with the crate of explosives:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|What did you find, <name>?}}
