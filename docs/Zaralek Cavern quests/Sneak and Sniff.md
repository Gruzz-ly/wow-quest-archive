:{{Text|say|Myrrit|I smell worms and...<sniff>...giant bats!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|We can burrow under the bats to avoid their echolocation, but watch out for worms while we're down there!}}

In the tunnels are flying [[Blind Seeker]]s. On the ground are circles that when burrowed by Myrrin, [[Tunneling Rockborer]] appears, but they are not required. From a small burrow, a [[Treasurewhiskers]] appears. It drops [[Wriggling Worm (starter)]] starting [[Slimy Yet Satisfying]].

:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Oh! Stop everything! What's this special scent...?}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|It's a treasurewhiskers! They steal all sorts of things from us!}}

Near the treasure chest is the [[Bubbling Elixir]] starting [[A Glass of Bubbly]].

Continue searching the tunnels to find the [[Jangly Keys]] to loot the [[Jangly Key]].

:{{Text|say|Myrrit|A key!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Now we just need to sneak back to the chest! Quiet, like treasure-mice!}}

Return to the Treasure Chest and open it.

:{{Text|say|Myrrit|I love being sneaky like this! They never saw us coming!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Let's head back to town.}}
