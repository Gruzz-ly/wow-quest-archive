'''Worst of the Worst''' concludes the fourth chapter of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]], "Inherited Sin", alongside [[Break Them Out (Zaralek Cavern)]]. The campaign continues with [[Fading Embers]].

==Objectives==
{{questportrait|Overseer Xymra.jpg|[[Overseer Xymra]]|As ruthless as she is heartless, Xymra's top priority is recapturing all of the slitherdrakes.}}
Find and eliminate [[drakonid]] leading the [[poacher]]s.
* [[Overseer Xymra]] slain {{co|57.0|30.3|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
Everything here suggests this is a well-coordinated effort. These [[slitherdrake]]s are almost like wild beasts. They will not stand a chance without our aid.

Find whoever is leading their operation and put an end to this.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* [[Regurgitated Half-Digested Fish]]
* [[Winding Slitherdrake]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Yes, <name>?

==Completion==

So the slitherdrakes were not born here, but inside [[Aberrus]]?

Were they part of his experiments that ultimately led to the creation of the [[dracthyr]]? When I think about that, it horrifies me how easy it was for [[Neltharion]] to both create and destroy life.

Nevertheless, that was a decisive blow to their operation.

==Notes==
On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Overseer Xymra|Hurry up and lock their cages. We march for Aberrus soon.}}
:{{text|say|Overseer Xymra|I will personally make sure these... experiments never again escape from the lab.}}

Find [[Overseer Xymra]] in the back of the [[Slitherdrake Roost]] far to the east, standing over piles of broken slitherdrake eggs and another caged slitherdrake.

Aggro her:
:{{text|say|Overseer Xymra|You think yourself a hero? You're nothing more than a thief!}}

Defeat her:
:{{text|say|Overseer Xymra|The drakes... belong to us.}}

On completion of both, an in-engine cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|Ui3i7NPm0xA}}
:''One of the slitherdrakes sits down and curls up as [[Sabellian]] walks over to it and [[Wrathion]].''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|These serpent creatures may prove useful, if they can be made to serve [[Black dragonflight|the flight]].}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|They are not creatures, Sabellian; they are our kin.}}
:''Sabellian walks northwest to look at [[Brimstone Garrison]] as one of the slitherdrakes flies toward [[Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible|Aberrus]] in the distance.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|They are my father's failed experiments, nothing more.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Fodder for the battlefield.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|How we were created does not define us.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Or am I just fodder to you as well?}}
:''At this, Sabellian turns around to look at Wrathion.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Yes. That is precisely what you are.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|You are wrong.}}
:''Wrathion walks away in a huff. Ebyssian gets up from looking at the Zaqali Berserker corpse and walks over to Sabellian, who is now looking at the [[Elders' Gift]].''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Do you not see that your fates are bound?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Deny it as you might, he is your brother, and you are his.}}
:''The curled-up slitherdrake flies away and catches up with another heading west.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Two wings, that must learn to fly, or fail, together... before it is too late.}}
:''The scene fades to black.''
