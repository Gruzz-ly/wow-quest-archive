==Objectives==
Find [[Field Commander Ignax]] in the [[Battlefield Ruins]].

==Description==
Our situation is worse than we thought. 

Their dominance of the air keeps us at a disadvantage. They plan on freeing their powerful Elder from [[Aberrus]]. Allowing them to accomplish this could result in us permanently forfeiting control of this area.

Seek out Field Commander Ignax in the Battlefield Ruins and see what can be done to turn the tide of this battle. We will join you shortly.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
It is good to see an ally out here in the field. We could use one right now.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Take these bombs to the Field Commander. I am certain he will know what to do with them.}}
:''[[Kasztan]] walks off.''
:{{text|say|Wrathion|We're counting on you, friend.}}

Ebyssian has new gossip:
:{{gossip|Why are the djaradin here?}}
:Local scouts have observed increased djaradin activity in the area in recent days.

:Given your discovery, it would seem their plan is to break into Aberrus and rescue some entity they refer to as the "elder."

:Could it be their old leader or some other equally important figure?

Players are buffed with:
:{{Abilities|B-b-bombs! In My Backpack?!|Carrying a backpack full of bombs. Everything will be fine!|id=404201|icon=inv_eng_bombfire}}

Head west across the bridge to the [[Obsidian Spire Outpost]]:
:{{text|say|Field Commander Ignax|Put your weapons down! This one's friendly.}}
