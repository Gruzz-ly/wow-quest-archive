==Objectives==
Investigate the [[Gaze of Neltharion]] in the [[Sulfur Wastes]].
* Investigate the Tower {{co|47.7|48.7|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Investigate the Corpse
* Investigate the Broken Weapon
* Investigate the Cracked Jar
* Investigate the Book
* [[Waste Disposal Notes]]

==Description==
<Name>, I... don't want to ask more of you, but could you help us finally complete our mission?

We were ordered to investigate the Gaze of Neltharion. We were defeated on our first approach, but with an escort of two dragons and the mighty <name>, I'm not as worried about the [[djaradin]].

I want us to move out soon. Could you scout out the tower first for us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Did you scout out the tower?

==Completion==
You were attacked by what?! Are you okay? 

What did you find? Another book?

Tellywin, come and take a look at this!

==Notes==
Fly to the tower and land at the base. Just outside are a [[Broken Weapon (Zaralek Cavern)|Broken Weapon]] and the corpse of a [[Brimstone Lookout]]. Interact with the weapon to spawn the ghost of an [[Obsidian Guard]]:
:{{text|say|Obsidian Guard|Failed experiment! To the wastes with you!}}

Defeat it:
:{{text|say|Obsidian Guard|To the wastes... with... you...}}

Inspect the corpse:
: <You inspect the corpse closely. It has weapon wounds that have a slight blue sludge around the edges.
: The deceased's only possession seems to be a piece of half-chewed, mystery-meat jerky.>
: {{gossip|<Pick up the jerky.>}}

This adds a piece of [[Questionable Jerky]] to the player's bags. Eat it (or, preferably, don't...), then check inside the broken tower for a [[Cracked Jar]]:
: <The bottom of the broken jar is stained. It appears it once held a bright blue liquid.
: The jar must have cracked when the tower was damaged.>

A few yards away is a [[Weathered Book]]:
: <This book appears to list test subject names. Each one is marked terminated, dumped, or both.>
: {{gossip|quest=|<Pick up the book to bring to Narvra.>}}
The player picks up the [[Waste Disposal Notes]] and the ghost of [[Kartoros]], the head of waste disposal, spawns:
:{{text|say|Kartoros|Get your filthy hands off my book!}}

Fend off the ghost:
:{{text|say|Kartoros|Throw yourself... into... the... wastes...}}

Before leaving, note the [[Primal Power (object)|Primal Power]] just outside, one of the criteria for [[Ancient Stones of Zaralek]].

Once done, head just northeast of the tower to catch up with the party:
:{{text|yell|[[Voraxian]]|<Name>! What good timing. We just arrived.}}
:{{text|say|[[Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental]]|As we crossed the bridge, I noted the northern Sulfur Wastes had a significant number of [[ghost]]s wandering about.}}
:{{text|say|[[Tellywin Sharpfizzle]]|Ghosts are never a good sign.}}
:{{text|say|Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|Indeed. That is why I thought it worthy of note.}}
:{{text|say|[[Earthmender Narvra]]|<Name> has beaten us to the punch and returned from the tower. Let's see what they found.}}

All present have gossip:
;Voraxian: The things that have happened here... We must find out more.
;Tellywin Sharpfizzle: <As Tellywin adjusts his glasses, the mechanical eye underneath also adjusts.>
: I am looking forward to when we can return to the surface. This is more dangerous than I expected.
: <He nervously touches his swords on his back.>
: Maybe I should learn how to use these.
;[[Chef Butterfingers]]: Make sure you're eating right, <name>. This adventuring stuff will burn off your energy like crazy.
;[[Veritistrasz]]: Keep a watchful eye out, <name>. I would hate to have to patch you up as well.
;Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental: Good day to you, <name>. Once again we find ourselves in quite the problematic situation. 
: Although based on the stories, I suppose this is a regular day for you.

On complete:
:{{text|say|Tellywin Sharpfizzle|This book contains notes on... test subjects? Almost all were marked dumped, and some were... alive when that happened.}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|By the elements... They were testing on live subjects?}}
:{{text|say|Tellywin Sharpfizzle|This timeline is... wrong. The [[Dragon Isles]] were sealed just after the [[black dragon]]s fell. But there are hundreds of test records...}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|[[Neltharion]]'s twisted ways started a lot earlier than anyone dared imagine, it seems.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|This... this is horrific...}}
