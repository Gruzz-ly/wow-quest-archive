:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Huh, this place looks a little empty. But I can't see any way to open that chest up there.}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Maybe those pressure plates might help?}}

In the tunnel ahead are two [[Pressure Plate]]s. Above them are floating a [[Fire Charge]] and a [[Frost Charge]]. Put Myrrit down on one plate, click the other crystal to get the opposite buff. Go to the other side of the room and get the glittering key fragments (obtain the frost buff for the fire fragment and fire buff for the frost one). Then swap Myrrit and the buff. A [[Neutralizing Charge]] is also present in case of a mistake. Once you have [[Flame-Engulfed Key Fragment]] and [[Frost-Encased Key Fragment]], use the Combine Fragments extra action button.
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|A key!}}

Head further and loot the chest.
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|That puzzle would have stumped Effie and me for hours. Great job!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|We're a great team--strong and sniff-tastic!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|That was amazing. Let's head back with our treasure!}}
