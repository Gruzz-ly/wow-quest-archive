==Objectives==
Collect 8 Calcisilk Bundles.
*[[Calcisilk Bundle]] (8)

==Description==
We may not have access to all those fancy plant fibers you surface types use up here, but we do have a lot of options I bet you don't!

The [[spider]]s near [[Loamm]] make the most interesting smelling silk I ever did sniff. I think it might have something to do with their diet?

If you round some up, I'm sure [[Rossmar]] back in Loamm will be happy to teach you a thing or two about how to use it!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

==Progress==
Just follow the bone-y smells!

==Completion==
Doesn't the calcium give it the best texture?
