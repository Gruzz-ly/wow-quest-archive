==Objectives==
Collect 4 Glimmer Mushrooms and 4 Echoed Lurker Flesh near [[Glimmerogg]].
* [[Echoed Lurker Flesh]] (4)
* [[Glimmer Mushroom]] (4)

==Description==
It's doesn't matter if you were invited or if you just showed up. [[Drogbar]], [[niffen]], or <race>, everyone pays for the Glimmerogg Games! 

Even I did, and I'm runnin' this show!

<[[Brogg the Beast|Brogg]] points aggressively to a ticket of his own.>

I know you can't pay in drogdollars, but you can pay in snacks for everyone. And we love mushrooms and fish! Bring Brogg some food, and we're square, okay?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Have the fee in full? And no, can't pay later. Brogg had enough from deadbeats.

==Completion==
Good work, uplander. Now Brogg has snacks for the week!

...I mean, we have snacks for everyone!

Now, get out of here. And have some fun, brul!

==Notes==
[[Echoed Lurker]]s in the water just to the south drop [[Echoed Lurker Flesh]], and [[Glimmer Mushroom]]s are found north of Glimmerogg.

On completion of both:
