[[File:Rushing Quality.jpg|thumb|Channeling the [[shadowflame]] out of [[Sabellian]] with [[Fyrakk]] in the background]]

==Objectives==
Cleanse the [[shadowflame]] from [[Sabellian]]'s injury.
* Head to the altar {{co|33.2|50.9|Zaralek Cavern}}
* [[Zaqali Flame Totem|Totem]] placed
* [[Vacant Elemental Core|Elemental Cores]] placed (5)
* Take your ritual place and assist Ebyssian
* [[Darkened Elemental Core]]s contained (5)
* Darkened Cores thrown into lava

==Description==
Look ahead! The [[djaradin]] have cleared away from the northeastern side of the [[Zaqali Caldera|caldera]] to augment their forces near the elders.

There is an altar bordering the lava pool that appears safe for now. We can set up our spell components there.

Let us hurry before the djaradin return.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* [[Pocket Darkened Elemental Core]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
[[Fyrakk]] and the elders can wait.

If Sabellian is lost, we will fail regardless.

==Completion==
Sabellian is still injured from the burn, but the shadowflame has been purged from him.

It is the best I can do for now. I will ensure that he has time to rest later.

==Notes==
Head to the altar overlooking the caldera proper and [[Fyrakk]]:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|We will need to work quickly while Fyrakk's forces are distracted.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Then hurry it up! Our window of opportunity is rapidly closing!}}

Interact with the ghost totem to place it:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|That will work. Place the cores around the totem. We will use them to contain the shadowflame as we draw it out of Sabellian's wound.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Hurry, <name>. I can feel it burning deeper into me. This is a nightmare! This is what turned my father into a monster.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Sabellian, you are not [[Deathwing|our father]]! You are so much stronger. You can resist this evil. I have faith in you.}}

Then interact with the five Vacant Elemental Cores to place them as well:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I will need your help, <name>. Please, when you are ready, I will channel through us both.}}

Step in the spot and use the extra action button that appears:
:{{Abilities|Assist Ebyssian|Lend your strength to Ebyssian, helping him perform a ritual to cleanse the shadowflame from Sabellian's injury.|id=400855|icon=ability_shaman_windwalktotem}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|It--My arm is going n-numb, what are you doing?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Drawing the shadow's corruption to the surface. Hold strong!}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|The pain is too great!}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|It is done. I have purged it from you. You are free.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Gather the cores, <name>. We need to get rid of them.}}

Gather up all five [[Darkened Elemental Core]]s:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Throw them into the lava pool.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|That will further empower that corrupted Incarnate!}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|The harm is already done. Salt returned to the ocean.}}

Then use the extra action button that appears:
:{{Abilities|Toss Cores|Throw the cores into the magma!|id=400826|icon=inv_shadowflame_orb}}

==Progression==
{{The Ancient Bargain}}
