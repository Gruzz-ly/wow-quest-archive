:{{Text|say|Myrrit|These elementals don't seem too big. That's a relief. Where should we start?}}

Up ahead are two pairs of [[Fire Guardling]]s and [[Air Guardian]]s. [[Ice Guardling]]s also appear. In the upper area is an [[Earthward Challenger]].

Kill the elementals and approach the small tablets and big runestones. Two small tablets are missing so use Myrrit's sniff, burrow, and dig abilities. Read the [[Cracked Tablet (Mysterious Cave)|Cracked Tablets]] and notice the direction and elements (bolded below).

*In from the '''east''', a fair, new '''wind''' doth blow,

:And on its gale is change for us below,
*A cage, a lair, for [[Neltharion]]'s schemes,

:'''Northern''' '''fire'''-filled pools fuel his darkest dreams.
*<This tablet has taken too much damage. It is no longer readable.>
*The cavern cowered and trembled in the '''west''',

:'''Rocks''' rising at the Earth-Warder's behest.
*Long, long ago, life from the '''south''' did spring,

:'''Waters''' flowed for those of feet, paws, or wing.

Head up the tunnel.
