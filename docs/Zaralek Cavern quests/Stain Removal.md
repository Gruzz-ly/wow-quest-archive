'''Stain Removal''' concludes the optional "Medicinal Fungi" storyline in the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]]. After the next daily reset, check back in with Veritistrasz, who offers [[The Tale of Hraxian]].

==Objectives==
Complete the cleansing ritual.
* Start the Ritual
*Complete the Ritual
* [[Lead Researcher Sytorian]] slain {{co|48.8|28.5|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
We can begin the ritual whenever you are ready.

Let's help these spirits pass on.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* [[Honorary Explorer's Compass]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
We need to complete this ritual, <name>.

==Completion==
Thank you <name>.

As Sytorian passed, the ritual was unblocked and we were able to complete it. In time, the last remnants of his actions will fade.

You have helped so many today. I don't know if we can ever repay you. For now though. I think we should return to camp.

==Notes and trivia==
[[File:Stain Removal - ritual.jpg|thumb|The ritual active]]

On accept:
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|We will need your help to perform the ritual, <name>. Take your place when you are ready.}}

[[Veritistrasz]] has new gossip:
:Let us complete this ritual as fast as we can. I... Something feels wrong here. It is like walking through the aftermath of a battlefield, but feeling like you are still being watched.

As does [[Voraxian]]:
:This ritual is important, but I would like to be done with it quickly. 
:This place... it does not sit right with me. The things they have done here... it is like iced hands crawling under my scales.
:I do not want to stay here any longer than I have to.

Stand in the marked spot between Veritistrasz and Voraxian on the southwestern part of the ring, then use the extra action button:

:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|[[Earthmother]], hear our call. Help us cleanse this land so these poor creatures can find peace.}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|Nnn... Something... is resisting the... ritual...}}
:{{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|I will not let you undo all my work! It will save [[Azeroth]]!}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Your work has saved nothing and no one. It is time to move on.}}
:{{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|Go back to your "life pools," red! This is an obsidian matter and concerns you not.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Obsidian matter? There is no excuse for what you have done here!}}
:{{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|No... no... you just do not understand...}}
:''Sytorian stuns the two dragons and flies off with them to the north.''
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|No! The ritual! Keep it together!}}
:{{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|But... I will make you understand. You will see. You will agree with me...}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|Nnn... Go, <name>. We will keep the ritual active. Go get them! Rupert, let's give it everything we have!}}
:{{text|say|[[Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental]]|It would be my pleasure. Give that degenerate a good thrashing, <name>.}}

Follow Sytorian to an island in the lava river. Sytorian, in visage form, is still holding Veritistrasz and Voraxian stunned. Aggro him and Sytorian reverts to his dragon form:
:{{text|yell|Lead Researcher Sytorian|You will understand!}}

[[File:Stain Removal - after.jpg|thumb|[[Voraxian]] and [[Veritistrasz]] freed]]
Defeat him:
:{{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|No! I must complete my research and save Azeroth!}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Neltharion is dead. No one is coming for your research.}}
:{{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|No... it cannot have been for nothing... That would mean all those things I did...}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|In ten thousand years, Azeroth has been saved many times without your research.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Go to whatever awaits you beyond.}}
:{{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|I am released? I am... afraid...}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Let us be done with this place.}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Voraxian|I want to thank all of you. You have seen the worst of [[Black dragonflight|my flight]]'s history and stayed to help me make things right.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|I cannot change what happened here, but I can do better. I can help my flight be better.}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|After everything we have been through, this feels like the least we could do.}}
:{{text|say|[[Chef Butterfingers]]|Yeah!}}
:{{text|say|Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|Indeed.}}
:{{text|say|[[Tellywin Sharpfizzle]]|Exactly!}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|I am very proud of you, Voraxian. In the shadow of your [[Deathwing|forefather]]'s citadel, you proved yourself a better [[dragon]].}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Thank you, all of you. Can we head back to camp? I would like to be done with this place.}}
:''They start walking south along the road.''
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Last one back is a crusty [[hornswog]].}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Tellywin... could I ask you to write about this? So the world knows?}}
:{{text|say|Tellywin Sharpfizzle|You want me to write about it? My goodness, what an honor! Our group will need a name for posterity though. What should we call ourselves?}}
:{{text|say|Chef Butterfingers|Butterfingers and his Sous-Chefs?}}
:{{text|say|Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|The Long-Suffering Rupert and his Wayward Charges?}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Hah. <Name> and Others?}}
:{{text|say|Tellywin Sharpfizzle|This is serious! Every group needs a good name. You wouldn't pay attention if the [[Valdrakken Accord]] was called "Some Random Dragons"!}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|I might. Some Random Dragons sounds interesting. It could be anything.}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|Could even be dragons.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Exactly.}}
:{{text|say|Tellywin Sharpfizzle|I can see working with you all is going to be insufferable.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|How about... "The Dragons and the Scale Expedition"?}}
:{{text|say|Tellywin Sharpfizzle|Hmm. Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, but it's not bad. We'll workshop it!}}
:{{text|say|Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|I am looking forward to returning to camp and having a spot of tea.}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|Tea sounds wonderful.}}
:{{text|say|Chef Butterfingers|I can throw some food together as well!}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Rupert, I have to ask. The hat makes sense to me, but why the monocle?}}
:{{text|emote|Veritistrasz smiles towards Voraxian.}}
:{{text|say|Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|Well you see...}}
:''They disappear into the distance.''

Check back in at [[Dragonscale Camp]], and everyone has gossip:
;Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental: It is wonderful to see you again, <name>. 
: Considering what we witnessed in the [[Acidbite Ravine]], the mood here is quite buoyant. 
: I am sure it is not just my tea, but as they say: every little helps!
;Tellywin Sharpfizzle: <Tellywin looks up from a journal he is writing in.>
: Well... I suppose I did ask for something to write about.
: I wish it wasn't this, but... the world needs to know. And someone has to write it.
;Earthmender Narvra: I look around this campfire and I know we wouldn't be alive if it weren't for you. 
: I know you do this a lot; I've read the stories of your exploits. You go around saving people, defeating the bad guys.
: I just want you to know that from one of the people you saved: it means a lot. 
: Thank you.
;Chef Butterfingers: <Name>! You're always welcome at our camp. Do you want something to eat? Maybe a spot of tea? I know Rupert is always looking for an excuse to brew a cup!
; Veritistrasz: You continue to help people, even after everything you have seen and been though. 
: You inspire me. I hope one day I can live up to that example.
;Voraxian: Even after everything you have seen my flight do, you still come to talk to me. 
: Thank you, <name>. You are a good person.

The food from [[Respite]] is still on the table -- interact with something to pick up an hour-long buff:
:{{Abilities|Campfire Food|Chef Butterfingers delicious campfire food. You feel warm and full.|id=403996|icon=spell_fire_fire|notes=60 min buff. No combat effects}}

The "It could be anything. / Could even be dragons." lines references the ''{{wplink|Family Guy}}'' Mystery Box skit in the episode "{{wplink|I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar}}".
