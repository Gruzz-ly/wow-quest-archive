==Objectives==
Lasso 8 [[Redolent Whelk]]s to collect Snail Slime in [[Zaralek Cavern]].
* [[Snail Slime]] (8)
* [[Snail Lasso]] (provided)

==Description==
<Name>, if I could grab your ear again, my dear?

Since making it back to [[Loamm]], I've noticed that some of our incense pots have gone missing.

Incense is what we use to mark our trade routes, and find our way back to Loamm. It's very important that we replace the missing incense as soon as possible.

By the way, we make our incense from snail slime, so you're going to have to wrangle some snails first!

Once you're done, [[Citros]] can help you out with the rest.

Say hello to [[Marie Shellie]] for me!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Snail slime is the base that most of our incense is built upon.

==Completion==
Did [[Aurantia]] send you? This snail slime is mighty fine--it'll make some great incense!

==Notes==
Head northeast to the [[Shimmering Towers]] and use the provided [[Snail Lasso]] on a [[Redolent Whelk]] in the area, then run around with it until the 30-second buff wears off. The lassoed snail will leave Snail Slime objects in the slime trail.
