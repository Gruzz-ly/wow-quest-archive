==Objectives==
Collect 6 Glow Spores.
* [[Glow Spores]] (6)

==Description==
The [[niffen]] say that sniffin' mice have great noses. They can make their way through the caverns and track down the fastest racing snails. Even sniff out glow spores ready for harvest.

But I have a good nose, too. Maybe I could even sniff out those glow spores!

Let's collect the harvest for the hermit. That will can show him it's okay that his mouse friend isn't here--because I can fill in!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Sniffin' mice must make this a lot easier. But I don't mind hard work!

==Completion==
See? Just as good as a sniffin' mouse!

I hope the hermit agrees...

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Agrul|If we do some farm work, that hermit will see that I could help out around here. Even better than a mouse!}}

Agrul joins the party, but pick up the other quest before heading out.

Look for piles of Smelly Dirt marked on the minimap. Agrul will stomp on it, wrangling up a [[Rock Viperling]] or some [[Glow Spores]]. He'll bark one of:
*{{text|say|Agrul|Found something!}}
*{{text|say|Agrul|Right there!}}
*{{text|say|Agrul|Something smelly over here!}}

On return, Agrul has new gossip:
:{{gossip|Why do you want to be a farmhand?}}
:Working on a farm seems... calm. Lots of time for thinking.
:No boss bruls yelling at you. Making you do mean things... 
:Hmph. Maybe I need a change.
:I want to be proud of my work. Really help someone.
:Do something good.
