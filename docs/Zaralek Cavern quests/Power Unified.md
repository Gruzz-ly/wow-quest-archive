==Objectives==
Find another Splintered Spark of Shadowflame.
* [[Splintered Spark of Shadowflame]]

==Description==
Fortune has favored our exploration, <name>! We have discovered something that may prove useful to you.

It is half of a Spark of Shadowflame. It's unfortunately just a shard and not powerful on its own, but should you locate the other piece and unite them, the spark could serve as a powerful reagent in your craft work.

Find another Splintered Spark of Shadowflame. Unite both pieces to unlock their full potential.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 2x [[Splintered Spark of Shadowflame]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Did you find the other half of the spark?

==Completion==
Excellent! If you find other splintered sparks, combine them to enhance your craft work!

==Notes==
Tae'shara has some useful gossip here:
:The smell here will take some getting used to.
:{{gossip|Where can I find Splintered Sparks of Shadowflame?}}
:An excellent question. 
:The niffen call Zaralek Cavern their home. If you wish to merely use the sparks' power as you explore, they may be able to guide you in your effort to find some if you help them in return. 
:I have also heard that Malicia in Valdrakken has quite a collection of powerful items... If you wish to use the sparks in battle, perhaps proving yourself against your fellow adventurers in combat will convince her to part with one?
:Make your decision prudently. They are a scarce commodity, and you will only be able to select one until more are recovered.

The flavor text on the splintered spark points to [[A Worthy Ally: Loamm Niffen]], and [[Malicia]]'s weekly PvP quests. Only one splintered spark can be obtained per week.
