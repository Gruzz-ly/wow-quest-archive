==Objectives==
Investigate the scavenged relics.
* Investigate [[Rusted Relic]] {{co|62.5|41.7|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Investigate [[Damaged Relic]] {{co|60.3|42.7|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Investigate [[Humming Relic]] {{co|58.8|41.6|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
Look closely, <name>. You see this odd chunk of metal in the deepflayer muck?

I have felt my head swimming since we arrived in these caverns. I thought it was just the ceaseless prattling of our whelp, [[Wrathion]], but this object here may prove otherwise.

I will continue my efforts to unlock this relic's secrets. Seek out similar pieces in the nearby caves. A dark theory is emerging, though we will need more information before I am willing to confirm it.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 XP
* +60 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I know this device still has power...

==Completion==
A dead [[scout]] for the [[Sundered Flame]] near one of the relics? 

That is no coincidence. [[Ebyssian]] told us they were pursuing clues left by [[Deathwing|father]]. I must admit that this relic, and the ones you describe finding, look quite familiar to me.

Familiar... And familial. It stirs my insides.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Wait, <name>. Before you go, I feel I must... apologize.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|My temper got the best of me a moment ago. In truth, I reminded myself of [[Deathwing|my father]] in that moment. But that is not who I am.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Something about [[Zaralek Cavern|this place]] is causing me to lose focus and become distracted. That is how [[Fyrakk]] was able to defeat us so easily. I will not let that happen again.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Wrathion, as brash a fool as he is, did not deserve my ire. Neither did you. Please forgive my reaction and let us continue as companions.}}

The [[Rusted Relic]] is to the east in a small cave:
: <You prod, but the relic seems inactive. You eventually reveal a small slot. 
: Within the slot is a series of buttons, each with a unique symbol.
: Sabellian will want to know about this.>

The [[Damaged Relic]] is in the middle of the quest area by a small tunnel:
: <This relic has clearly been mauled by the Deepflayers.
: You take what parts of it still seem undamaged for Sabellian to find use for.>

The [[Humming Relic]] is to the west in a small cave, with the corpse of a [[Sundered Flame Scout]] in front of it:
: <A [[Sundered Flame]] Scout lays dead, slain and feasted on by the [[Prismatic Snailette|nearby beasts]].
: Their hand rests on a conspicuous button connected to the relic.>
: {{gossip|Press the button.}}
: {{text|say|Scavenged Relic Recording|Zzzt...I can't...zzt...experiment loose...}}
: {{text|say|Scavenged Relic Recording|Broke...zzzzzzt...my promise...}} (the voice line for this text includes "to the Aspects" at the end...)

The corpse has this gossip:
: <A dead Sundered Flame scout! Judging by the slimy residue, they were no doubt surprised by a family of aggressive Zaralek snails while investigating the nearby relic.
: Other scouts may have been luckier than this one. We must inform our black dragon companions that Sarkareth is likely underground too. 
: Even worse, he may know the secret of these relics.>

On complete:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Ah, perfect. Thank you, <name>. These spare parts are just what I need.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|And a hidden slot with buttons, you say? Ah! Here it is.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|The faded symbols on the buttons, they are draconic-- Oh! What is this now?}}
:''Sabellian steps away as an image of Neltharion appears from the relic.''
:{{text|say|Neltharion|My ambitions were far greater than my capacity to control what I had created.}}
:{{text|say|Neltharion|Oh, [[Aberrus]]. My beloved laboratory. I must leave you to the dust and ruin of these caverns.}}
:{{text|say|Neltharion|May my kin never find what I have attempted here.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Father...}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|What is Aberrus? What horrors have you unleashed upon us this time?}}

;Objectives
* Return to Sabellian with found clues
* Assist Sabellian activate the relic

;Progress
Is there no end to the secrets our father kept?

;Completion
So my father has been here in these caverns before.

No--Not just been here. Worked here. He built yet another lab, and it most likely contains further terrifying machinations of his creation.

We must speak to Ebyssian about this.

;Speaking to Sabellian
:Frustrating as he is, I see some part of my young self in Wrathion.

:{{gossip|Tell Sabellian about the other scavenged relics.}}
