==Objectives==
Collect 10 Underlight Cocoons Fibers in [[Zaralek Cavern]].
*[[Underlight Cocoon Fibers]] (10)

==Description==
Hello friend! You're a tailor, right? So you must know about silk!

Mister down in [[Loamm]] knows how to make special silk from the cocoons of the [[Underlight Moth]]s, but could use some help gathering them up!

You should be able to find them in the mushroomy area near [[Glimmerogg]]. I'll sure he will make it worth your while!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

==Progress==
Hey, uplander! Do you have those cocoons yet?

==Completion==
These look great! Thanks, <name>!

Now we just need to boil them and turn them into thread. Oh they make SUCH a smelly smell when you boil them.

What's that? You have to go? Oh, ok!
