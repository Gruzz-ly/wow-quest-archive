==Objectives==
Collect 10 Whelkshell Crystals and deliver them to [[Fanilly]] in [[Loamm]].
*[[Whelkshell Crystals]] (10)

==Description==
Well, hello there!

Have you seen [[Rock snail|those snails]] in Zaralek Cavern with the crystals growing from their shells?

When crushed to powder and mixed with a proper solution of slime, those crystals make a paste that adds a considerable luster to our gems! Bring some to my good friend Fanilly, and I'm sure she'll be happy to chat your ear off about [[jewelcrafting]]!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Jeweler's Cuts
}}

==Progress==
You know, a good shine on a gemstone is very important to us... we have such a hard time seeing it otherwise!

==Completion==
Oh yes, this will do! Now watch, just grind it together, then apply it to the gem and polish...
