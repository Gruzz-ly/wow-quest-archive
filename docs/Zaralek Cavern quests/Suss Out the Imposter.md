==Objectives==
Defeat Nevroll and rescue Effervesta in [[Zaralek Cavern]].
* [[Nevroll]] slain {{co|58.3|52.5|Zaralek Cavern}}
* [[Effervesta]] Freed

==Description==
Do I smell... ?

If he's the kidnapper, that must mean he's also behind the missing shipment!

I don't think it's safe for me to go in there, <name>. 

Please, rescue Effie!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 57,100 [[XP]]
* [[Gift of the High Redolence]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]


==Completion==
Effie! I'm so glad she's okay!

==Notes==
Head into the cave to the north. [[Nevroll]] unleashes two [[Nevroll's Drogbar]]:
:{{text|say|Nevroll|Now go! I didn't give you all those swallow nests for you to sit around and watch!}}

Fend them off:
:{{text|say|Nevroll|Then I'll kill you myself!}}

Kill Nevroll, then interact with the Effervesta's Prison cage:
:{{text|say|Effervesta|Thank you, Uplander! I thought I smelled a hero!}}

Return to Aurantia, but she runs off:
:{{text|say|Aurantia|Come on, <name>!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Aurantia|Effie! I'm so glad you're safe.}}
:{{text|say|Effervesta|Oh Mom, I'm fine.}}
:{{text|say|Aurantia|That rat of a swallowskeeper didn't hurt you, did he?}}
:{{text|say|Effervesta|No--I promise, I'm fine! I can take care of myself, you know.}}
:{{text|say|Aurantia|You know how a mother worries. I just don't understand what he wanted...}}
:{{text|say|Effervesta|He wanted to take Loamm from us--and he was willing to use the drogbar to do it.}}
:{{text|say|Aurantia|Well, a couple of drogbar certainly aren't enough to take Loamm!}}
:{{text|say|Effervesta|Loamm, sweet Loamm.}}

Afterwords, check in with [[Myrrit]] for [[Best Friends (quest)]] to continue.
