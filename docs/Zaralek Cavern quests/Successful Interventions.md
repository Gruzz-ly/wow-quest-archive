:{{text|say|Myrrit|Gosh... this looks like a place of nightmares...}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|I don't like this! ...You go first.}}

Upon approaching [[Mr. Sunflower]] who is in a room with some tables and chairs, [[Webbed "Guest"]]s, [[Webbed Creature]]s and [[Credible Witness (Zaralek Cavern)|Credible Witnesses]]:
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|Visitors! You are most welcome. Join us!}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Oh, um, hello.}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|Everyone, say hello. Remember, use your friendship voices today.}}
:{{text|say|Webbed "Guest"|Hello.}}
:{{text|say|Webbed "Guest"|Hello.}}
:{{text|say|Webbed "Guest"|Hi.}}
:{{text|say|Webbed "Guest"|Hello.}}
:{{text|say|Webbed Creature|Hello.}}
:{{text|yell|Webbed "Guest"|LET ME OUT SO I CAN MURDER YOU ALL.}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|No no, no murder. That's why we're here! Friendship voices only, please!}}

Mr. Sunflower's gossip:
{{dialogue|Welcome! Please accept my hospitality, and have some tea.}}

Upon drinking the tea:
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|You seem like a calm sort. I'm glad to not need to web you!}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|I am Mr. Sunflower.}}

Mr. Sunflower has new gossip:
{{dialogue|
Good morning! Isn't it a delightful day to be alive?

{{Gossip|quest=|What exactly is going on in here?}}

{{dialogue-child|We are having an intervention for those who are purely focused on murder in their lives.

I am optimistic we will discover the root cause of their issues, and help them to understand where they went so wrong.

{{Gossip|quest=|Why are they webbed?}}
{{dialogue-child|I have found that if allowed out of their webs, they resume their murderous tendencies. The webs are required for safety, sadly.

But when one of them seems ready to re-enter the world, I let them out. They need to be ready to admit to themselves what drove them to be so angry.

Still, sometimes it's just very hard to judge.

{{Gossip|Um, okay...}}
}}

{{Gossip|quest=|How do you keep track of who is who?}}
}}
}}

:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|You know, that is a very big flaw I have discovered. I'm trying the honor system!}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|Speaking of--today, Ralph has earned his way back into society!}}
:{{text|say|Webbed "Guest"|Amazing!}}
:{{text|say|Webbed "Guest"|Woohoo!}}
:{{text|say|Webbed "Guest"|Great!}}
:{{text|say|Webbed Creature|Great!}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|So, remind me... which one of you is Ralph?}}
:{{text|say|Webbed "Guest"|I'm Ralph!}}
:{{text|say|Webbed "Guest"|No, I'm Ralph!}}
:{{text|say|Webbed "Guest"|Liar! I'm Ralph!}}
:{{text|say|Webbed "Guest"|How dare you!}}
:{{text|say|Webbed "Guest"|I'm Ralph!}}
:{{text|say|Webbed "Guest"|I'm Ralph!}}
:{{text|say|Webbed "Guest"|I'm Ralph!}}
:{{text|say|Webbed Creature|I'm Ralph!}}
:{{text|say|Webbed Creature|I'm Ralph!}}
:{{text|say|Webbed Creature|I'm Ralph, and so's my partner.}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|Oh dear, what a mess...}}

Mr. Sunflower has new gossip:

{{dialogue|
{{gossip|So we need to... find Ralph?}}

{{dialogue-child|That would be lovely! Please do!

When you're sure, point them out to me.

Perhaps my spider friends remember some details about Ralph that could be of help!

{{gossip|I'm on it.}}
}}
}}

Talk to the [[Webbed "Guest"]]s:

{{dialogue|Yeah?}}
{{dialogue|Yeah? What?}}
{{dialogue|Get me outta here!}}
{{dialogue|I've been here forever, let me out!}}

{{gossip|Ask about Ralph.}}

{{dialogue|title=Webbed "Guest" 1|I'm Ralph. Either ye believe me, or ye don't.}}

{{dialogue|title=Webbed "Guest" 2|I'm Ralph. There was a time where I went on any quest, did any job... I had every profession at one time or another! I'm a jewelcrafter now. Expensive gems are wonderful!

But those times are over. Still, I can look upon my adventuring days fondly, can't I? Since I'm so very cured now.}}

{{dialogue|title=Webbed "Guest" 3|I'm probably Ralph.

I've been here way too long. I don't know that my sanity can hold out.

Can you pour some tea into my web, please?}}

{{dialogue|title=Webbed "Guest" 4|I'm Ralph. I'll murder anyone who says otherwise!}}

{{dialogue|title=Webbed "Guest" 5|I'm Ralph. I'm entirely reformed. Don't you believe me?

I'm ...cured! It's a miracle! I don't hunt creatures just for the incredible thrill.

What else can I say to convince you? Oh! I have a horse. I talk about her all the time. Just ask anyone!}}

One can also ask [[Credible Witness (Zaralek Cavern)|Credible Witness]]es around the cave about Ralph:

{{dialogue|I hear all sort of things...

{{gossip|Ask about Ralph.}}

{{dialogue|title=Credible Witness 1|Ralph never talks about professions while questing.

One of the others is happy to talk to you about this one time she killed someone because they took some peacebloom though.
}}

{{dialogue|title=Credible Witness 2|I'm Ralph! Just kidding. I'm not a crazy murdering adventurer.

If I were Ralph, I'd say I hated tea and wanted beer.
}}

{{dialogue|title=Credible Witness 3|Let's see... Ralph used to talk more, but perhaps he has given up hope lately. He's been here longer than all of them, as far as I know. So many stories! I remember he had a mount named Gertrude, that he got near Ironforge. I don't think it's a horse.

Does that help?

Myrrit can tell you what the webbed guests smell like. Webbed "Guest" 1:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|This one smells like... some sort of hairy creature. They've been here a long time.}}

Webbed "Guest" 2:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|This smells like a very pleasant perfume! This must be expensive.}}

Webbed "Guest" 3:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|The deep smell of decay surrounds this one, they mostly smell like this room now.}}

Webbed "Guest" 4:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Wow, what a bloody smell. If they aren't injured, I wonder whose blood it is...}}

Webbed "Guest" 5:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Let's see... this is a sharp outdoor odor. This person hasn't been here very long!}}

Webbed Creatures:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|This creature was recently webbed up--maybe it just arrived.}}

When you are ready to pick talk to the chosen Webbed "Guest":
{{gossip|Point out that this is Ralph to Mr. Sunflower}}

If you make the wrong choice:
:{{text|say|Bloodthirsty Adventurer|Fooled you! DIE!}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|Oh no! That's not Ralph!}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|Use your friendly words! Please!}}
:Upon killing the adventurer:
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|That was unnecessary! My heart is very sad.}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Eeep. Maybe we can ask the witnesses and sniff out the right Ralph?}}

Upon making the right choice, which is Webbed "Guest" 1:
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|Ralph! There you are. Congratulations on your rehabilitation!}}
:{{text|say|Ralph Frostfoe|What a relief! Thank you! Please, help yerself to my old belongin's, as my thanks.}}
:{{text|say|Ralph Frostfoe|I have no need of 'em anymore. I'm off tae be a minimalist in ...Westfall.}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|Don't fall into your old murderous ways, now!}}
:{{text|say|Ralph Frostfoe|I won't. I see now where I went astray, all in tha name o' adventure. Here I come, Gertrude! Farewell!}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|I'm so happy for him.}}

Upon looting Ralph's abandoned belongings:
:{{text|whisper|Myrrit|Even if I told Effie about this, I don't think she'd believe me.}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Even so, we did great! You're brave AND clever!}}
:{{text|say|Mr. Sunflower|Come visit us again!}}
:{{text|whisper|Myrrit|Mr. Sunflower is a nope, nope, and nope for me! Let's get outta here!}}
