==Objectives==
Neutralize Zaqali Flametongues in the [[Battlefield Ruins]].
* [[Zaqali Flametongue]] slain (5)

==Description==
The Firecallers are a formidable force. Their powerful, lethal [[magic]] allows them to vaporize anything that comes near them.

Their strategic positioning on high ledges makes them difficult to reach, but we cannot allow them to continue causing destruction among our forces.

The fate of our forces depends on your success. Good luck!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Yes?

==Completion==
Another advantage taken from the enemy!

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Field Commander Ignax|Glory to the [[black dragonflight]].}}

The flametongues stand out thanks to their large lava balls they're magically holding.
