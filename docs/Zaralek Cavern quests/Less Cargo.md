==Objectives==
Collect 10 Stolen Supplies from [[djaradin]] in [[Igira's Watch]].
* [[Stolen Supplies (Dragonflight)]] (10)

==Description==
Those djaradin think they own these caverns, coming around here and looting our supplies. How am I supposed to train champions under these conditions?

Can you do me a favor and get those supplies back? I can't help you train Slick without them.

Besides, the big fellow could use a rest day.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Glimmerogg Racer]]

==Progress==
Shell polish, mucus paste, racing rocks... Crok it all, we need those supplies back!

==Completion==
Shell yeah! Way to put the work in. Now we can get back to Slick's training.

==Notes and trivia==
Defeat Zaqali djaradin in [[Igira's Watch]] for their [[Stolen Supplies (Dragonflight)]], including [[Zaqali Cragrunner|cragrunners]], [[Zaqali Farsser|farseers]], and [[Zaqali Infernoblade|infernoblades]].

This quest's name is a play on ''l'escargot'', meaning "the snail" in French.

==Progression==
{{Snail Racing}}
