:{{text|say|Myrrit|Wow, look at this place! It's like a palace!}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|There are so many smells around that orb! It's almost as if it's making them itself...}}

At the center of the room a [[Calibrating Scent Matrix]] can be found, during combat the orb makes a shield which can be dispelled by picking the right elemental pillar that appear around the orb:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|That orb is making a shield made of unique scents--let me sniff them!}}

When the element is water:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Ew. It smells really fishy in here now.}}

When the element is earth:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Why did that orb start smelling like worms?}}

When the element is fire:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Is that burned charcoal I smell?}}

When the element is air:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Oh wow, it smells just like lightning!}}

If the wrong element is picked:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|I don't think that element matches the smell!}}

Upon defeating the orb, it transforms into [[Titan Smell Cache]] which can be looted:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|I was afraid that we'd die in here when that scary thing appeared, but you smushed that guardian. Good work!}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|We're a great team--strong and sniff-tastic!}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|That was amazing. Let's head back with our treasure!}}
