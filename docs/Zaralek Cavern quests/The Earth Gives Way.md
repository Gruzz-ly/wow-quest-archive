==Objectives==
Speak with [[Wrathion]].

==Description==
It would seem there is truly no end to father's secrets.

I must have time to think on this. Meet me in [[Loamm]], where [[Elder Honeypelt|Honeypelt]] hails from. She offered us respite there while you were still in the cave.

I would only ask that you check on [[Wrathion]]. He may be a ceaselessly buzzing pest, yes, but... these recent events force me to admit I care for his well-being too.  

There are only so many [[black dragon]]s left. We must look out for each other.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Is that depressing lump of moods, Sabellian, alright?

...What? I care enough to at least ask about him!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Take care. I will wait for you along the path to this Honeypelt's home.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|"Aberrus"... [[Deathwing|Father]], what have you done down here?}}
:''Sabellian walks off.''

Before leaving, Sabellian has new gossip:
:Father... Is their no end to your senseless schemes? Your very presence?
:Even now, I can feel you cackling at me from beyond the grave.
:{{gossip|<Ask Sabellian to replay the recording of Neltharion.>}}
:''Repeats the Neltharion lines of the completion script of [[Secrets From Our Father]].''

==Progression==
{{Underground 1}}

==PTR version==

;Description
I believe I have found all the information I can here. I will take my leave to [[Elder Honeypelt|Honeypelt's]] home. It is called [[Loamm]], and she told us of it before you emerged from those caves earlier.

Please let Honeypelt know I will await her there. Wrathion too. He is a ceaselessly buzzing pest... but I one that I reluctantly admit I care for.

There are only so many black dragons left. We must look out for each other.
