'''Off to the Track''' begins the [[Loamm Niffen]] renown 7 storyline, introducing players to snail racing! [[Newsy]] will run up to players to offer this quest.

==Objectives==
Talk to [[Briggul]] in [[Glimmerogg]].

==Description==
Hey Champ! 

We got a fresh golden opportunity for you. Snail racing! One of the most dynamic sports in the games! 

[[Ponzo]] said you'd be interested. Called you a real go-getter!

So go! Get to the track in Glimmerogg! 

See ya there,<br>
Briggul

==Completion==
You're here! Now all we need to do is... train our snail!

==Notes==
At the snail racing track, check in with Briggul:
:Snail racing ain't for the faint of heart. These competitions are do or die. Literally. 
:We have a lot of escargot fans in these caverns.
:{{gossip|Are there any additional ways I can prove my aptitude for snail training to you?}}
:Listen. I'm a snail enthusiast. I've seen every type of snail this cavern has to show me.
:But I hunger for more. Not literally, of course.
:If you show me a snail that comes from outside this cavern, I could be convinced that you are a better snail trainer than I thought.

Briggul also has a personal friendship, [[Glimmerogg Racer]], which represents the player's training progress with Slick.
