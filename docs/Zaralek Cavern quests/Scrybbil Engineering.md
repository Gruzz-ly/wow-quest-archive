==Objectives==
Deliver Draconium Fisherfriends to [[Scrybbil]] in [[Loamm]].
*[[Draconium Fisherfriend]] (2)
*Deliver the item to Scrybbil in Loamm

==Description==
The kith of Loamm request the skills of an [[engineer]]! We have heard of the marvelous machines invented right here in [[Valdrakken|this city]], and eagerly wish to put these to use underground!

We have an engineer of our own down below, Mister Scrybbil, who has a special interest in what you call "fishing rods". How does such a thing work? Do you use them to spear the fish? How strange!

Please deliver these "fishing rods" as soon as you can, won't you?

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Barter Brick
|Barter Boulder
}}

==Progress==
Step right up, and witness the fantastic inventions of Scrybbil! Can I interest you in a [[firework]], sir and/or ma'am?

What's that? You have a delivery for me?

==Completion==
Oh, wonderful! I've been waiting for this day!

Down here, we just use our claws to catch [[fish]]. It's a bit barbaric and not really efficient! Now I can use this and catch a mountain of fish!

... How does it work?
