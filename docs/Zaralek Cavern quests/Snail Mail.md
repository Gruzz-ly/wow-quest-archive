==Objectives==
Deliver the package to [[Terryn]] in [[Loamm]] without dismounting [[Slick in the Big City|Slick]]. If you get dismounted from Slick, [[Briggul]] can give you a new delivery.
* Package collected from Briggul
* Package delivered to Loamm {{co|55.9|55.5|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
Racing snails are all about speed, but riding snails? They need stamina to boot.

I owe some supplies to a buddy in Loamm. Why don't you make the delivery for me? Help build Slick's endurance.

Oh, and make sure you don't dismount. Not much of a training session if you keep hopping off and on.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Glimmerogg Racer]]

==Progress==
This buddy of mine, always asking for supplies. I got snails to train!

==Completion==
Speed and stamina! This snail has it all, folks. Well done.

==Notes==
Speak with Briggul again:
:You just let me know if you need another package. 
:And remember, keep riding Slick until the delivery's done. No dismounting now, you hear?
:{{gossip|quest=|I am ready.}}

This will automatically mount Big Slick in the City. Head north out of Glimmerogg, following the road downhill to the north, then east. Along the way are speed circles. Ride Slick through them for a run speed boost. The trip takes about three minutes. Originally, the snail speed was slower and the boost lasted shorted, but the quest was hotfixed to make it easier.

At [[Loamm]], check in with [[Terryn]], while still mounted:
:You got something for me?
:{{gossip|Delivery!}}
:{{text|say|Terryn|You tell Briggul it was nice doing business with her!}}

Players can safely dismount after this point.
