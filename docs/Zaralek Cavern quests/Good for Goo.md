==Objectives==
Collect Goo from [[Ooze|slimes and oozes]] in [[Zaralek Cavern]].
* Slime collected (0/100%)

==Description==
Every [[snail]] trainer knows that it's all about the goo. The slime. The mucus. That's how you turn a speedy snail into a champion.

Slick could use a good slather. Go out and collect some goo from the local slime trails to slick him up. Heh.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Glimmerogg Racer]]

==Progress==
Sure, we could collect the mucus and store it in barrels, but hey! It's better fresh! Trust me on that.

<Briggul shivers ominously.>

==Completion==
Now that's a slicked Slick if I ever did see one. Nice job.

==Notes==
Several areas light up on the zone map: [[Igira's Watch]], the northern half of [[Zaqali Caldera]], and eastern [[Brimstone Garrison]] (outside of [[Professor Gastrinax]]'s building). Nothing special -- just kill the oozes and slimes: [[Molten Droplet]]s, [[Sulfur Bubble]]s, [[Amniotic Ooze]]s, and [[Zymote]]s.

==Progression==
