==Objectives==
Recover artifacts from the [[Buried Vault]].
* Collect Artifacts (3)

==Description==
This vault is of [[Black dragon|Black Dragon]] make which means its contents are [[Black dragonflight|my flight's]] property.

Normally I would have suggested we venture in together, but I was not expecting aggressive watchers. I will protect [[Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|Rupert]] while you search for artifacts for us to examine.

To keep you safe, I will cast a spell on you I use when fighting the [[gronn]].

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|21|6|75}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 28,550 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Did you find anything of interest?

==Completion==
Ah, the downside of spending all my life in [[Outland]]. I have no idea what these artifacts are... 

You say you found a journal? 

We should bring these back to the [[Dragonscale Camp|Dragonscale team]]. They may know more.

<[[Voraxian]] notices you looking at the [[Enraged Watcher|dead watchers]] around him.>

Ah yes, we had a bit of excitement while you were in the vault. No matter, it has been handled.

==Notes==
Pick up [[Bringing Disorder to Order]] before heading out. On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Here. Allow me to bestow upon you my bulwark. I hope it will aid you against the watchers!}}
:{{text|say|Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|And give those churlish watchers a jolly hard kick in the breeches for me!}}

Players are buffed with:
:{{Abilities|Voraxian's Bulwark|Voraxian has empowered you with the strength of his flight. Damage taken reduced by 50%. Damage increased by 200%.|id=400396|icon=inv_shield_1h_revenantfire_d_01}}

The three artifacts are inside the vault proper:

File:Research Notes (Zaralek Cavern).jpg|[[Research Journal (Dragonflight)]]
</gallery>

The journal reads:
{{book|Research Journal|content=<This journal includes notes on the various artifacts found in this vault. The final entry reads:>

The Gaze of Neltharion outpost is reporting "unexpected outcomes" after disposing of experimental waste. 

It is a characteristic understatement and intriguing. Neltharion has ordered that we close this vault and transfer back to Aberrus, but I intend to keep my focus on these "unexpected outcomes" once I arrive.

But I'll be lost without these notes. I must remember to pack them!}}
