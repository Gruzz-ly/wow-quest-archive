[[File:Whose Vault Is It Anyway.jpg|thumb|The party outside [[Nal ks'kol]]]]

==Objectives==
Talk to [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] once you are ready to go.
* Talk to Emberthal

==Description==
I do not know what we will find in the vault or why [[Scalecommander Sarkareth|Sarkareth]] wants access to it, but I hope we are not too late.

Before we continue any further, [[Tuberros]] should lead [[Rannan Korren|Rannan]] and [[Perisimona]] back to [[Loamm]].

Come and talk to me once you are ready to move forward.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|21|6|75}}
* 7,150 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I still think we should have sent them back to Loamm, but I trust Ebyssian's judgement.

==Notes and trivia==
Speak with Emberthal:
:So, Sarkareth is here in Nal ks'kol!
:We should be on our way before he finds what he is looking for.
:{{gossip|I am ready to go.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|<Name>, we must get to the vault. The rest of you should go back to Loamm where it's safer.}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|What? Between large snails, poisonous moths, and the [[Sundered Flame]], I think I'd rather stay with you, thank you very much!}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|Besides, who are you that you think you are in charge?}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I am Scalecommander Emberthal, and this is... Ebyssian.}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|Pfft, right...}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|Oh... you really are them?  I uhh... I mean, no offense, but I thought you would be bigger... or meaner-looking. You know, dragons... dracthyr.}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|I mean, you've got the tauren thing down. You look like one, smell like one and... I should just stop right here.}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|But! If you are heading to the titan vault, then I'm the person you want on your team!}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Team?}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|Of course! I know a lot about the titans! and Tubes over here? He knows a lot about it too!}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|A titan expert, hmm? Perhaps we could use your expertise.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Well, if you are staying, keep close to me. I don't want any harm to come to you.}}
:''They disappear at the top of the steps.''

Catch up with the party at the closed door:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I thought you said you were an expert.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Patience, Emberthal. I am sure that Rannan can figure it out soon enough.}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|Yeah, no pressure or anything.}}

At the door, Rannan has gossip:
:This door... what a marvel of titan ingenuity! It's ancient, but the technology...
:Don't tell the others, but this is the first time I have seen one outside of a book. 
:Oh, don't give me that look. Doors have worked the same way for millennia.
:And I have a plan!

As does Tuberros:
:Whoever this Sarkareth is, he is taking all of our shiny loots and treasures. You should show him the door and tell them to never sniff around this place.

As does Perisimona:
:Look at my snailykins standing on there, telling everyone what to do!
:I always smelled a kithmane's scent in him. He makes me proud!

The quest name is a reference to the TV show ''{{wplink|Whose Line Is It Anyway?}}''.
