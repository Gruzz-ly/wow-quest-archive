==Objectives==
Search near the [[Zaqali Quartermaster]] for any record of [[Tuskarr]] trading.
*Trade-bonded Tablet recovered ([[Ancient Trade-bonded Tablet]]) {{co|42.1|34.9|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
The [[Djaradin]] were trading harpoons with the Tuskarr? I suppose fish harpoons don't cut it when you're dealing with a [[dragon]].

How big was this shipment do you think? Check around the Zaqali Quartermaster and see if they held onto any ancestral records.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
: {{abilities|Azerothian Archives: Igira's Watch, Zaralek Cavern Site|Unlock the Azerothian Archives' World Quests in Igira's Watch of Zaralek Cavern.}}

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I know Djaradin aren't normally known for their record-keeping, but there must be something...

==Completion==
You're back! With good news, I hope?

==Notes==
Head north across the [[Elders' Gift]] to the [[Battlefield Ruins]] to find the [[Zaqali Quartermaster]] guarding the [[Ancient Zaqali Trade-bond Tablet]]. Interact with it to pick up the [[Ancient Trade-bonded Tablet]]. It reads:

{{book|content=<At the top of the tablet is an impressive facsimile of a Tuskarr, a pile of fish, and a heap of Djaradin spears.>}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Zenata|Let's see here...}}
:{{text|say|Zenata|It looks like the shipment of spears was large, and delivered quickly. What do you think the Tuskarr needed this weaponry for?}}

==Progression==
