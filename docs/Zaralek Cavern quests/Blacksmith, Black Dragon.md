==Objectives==
Collect 8 Blackened Plate.
*[[Blackened Plate]] (8)

==Description==
The black [[dragonkin]] in the north of [[Zaralek Cavern]] are said to be fine [[Smith|blacksmiths]].

They're quick to claim it has something do with a "dominion over the earth", but I'd like to see them try burrowing like a proper [[niffen]]!

Still, you can't argue with the results. Grab a few examples and bring them to [[Kilnmaster Crubus]] in [[Loamm]] so he can study their techniques.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Blacksmith's Writ
}}

==Progress==
I wonder if I could use one of their helmets as a tub?

==Completion==
The craftsmanship is impeccable, but would it kill them to use a color besides black?

==Patch changes==
