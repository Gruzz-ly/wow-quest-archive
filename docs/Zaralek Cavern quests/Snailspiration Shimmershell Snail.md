'''Snailspiration: Shimmershell Snail''' becomes available after summoning a [[Shimmershell Snail]].

==Objectives==
Summon a max-level Shimmershell Snail battle pet and show it to Briggul.
*Max level Shimmershell Snail shown to [[Briggul]]

==Description==
I smell a [[snail]] on you, but it's strange. You holding out on me?

Not many people know this, but snails are incredibly susceptible to peer pressure. Show off that wonder-snail you got there, and let's get [[Big Slick in the City|Slick]] inspired.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Glimmerogg Racer]]

==Progress==
Show me that snail! Let's inspire Slick to be his best slimy self.

==Completion==
Well, that shimmershell certainly lives up to its name! Practically glowing brighter than this cavern's crystals.

Absolutely stunning snailwork, <name>.

==Notes==
Speak with Briggul:
:{{Gossip|<Show Briggul your level 25 Shimmershell Snail.>}}
