==Objectives==
Feed [[Sharpbeak]] in the [[Dragonscale Camp]] in [[Zaralek Cavern]].
* [[Sharpbeak's Feed]] {{co|40.1|68.2|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Get Sharpbeak to accept her feed

==Description==
[[File:Satiating Sharpbeak.jpg|thumb|Sharpbeak in Zaralek Cavern]]

[[Sheridon Hastle]] was our flight master and Sharpbeak's rider. After his death, she won't let anyone touch her.

<[[Earthmender Narvra|Narvra]] clutches her side in pain.>

Or feed her. [[Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|Rupert]] tried but... she just won't.

The rest of us are too injured to move... I'm worried about her.

Can you... ow... try? Someone new may get through to her. Her feed is in the bag by the tent.

And... if you can get her to accept food, she might let you ride her.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 14,300 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
<Sharpbeak looks at you mournfully.>

==Completion==
<Sharpbeak tentatively accepts the feed from you. 

After a few snapping bites, she looks you in the eye, spreads her wings and shakes them.

You feel as though she might let you ride her if needed.>

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|Thank you for...arg... stopping when you saw us. I can't heal them...}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|You are all severely wounded. Let me take a look...}}

Narvra has gossip:
:<Narvra winces in pain.>
:Sheridon laid down his life to buy us time to retreat. He... he will be remembered. 
:We aren't a combat unit. Butterfingers has never even wielded a weapon. This was his first assignment as a full chef... 
:He was so proud and now I don't know if he'll make it out alive.
:My healing isn't working on them. Can you help?

[[Sharpbeak's Feed]] is on the crates just behind Narvra. Then head up the hill to [[Sharpbeak]] and speak with her:
:Squawk?
:{{gossip|quest=|Easy, easy. I'm here to help.}}
:<Sharpbeak watches you closely. She ruffles her feathers and shakes her head but stays otherwise still.>
:{{gossip|<Slowly approach Sharpbeak. Pet her feathers gently.>}}
:<Sharpbeak looks at you mournfully but doesn't move.>
:{{gossip|<Put some feed in your hand and hold it out to Sharpbeak.>}}
:<Sharpbeak looks at the feed in your hand, then back to you. She inches her head forwards.>
