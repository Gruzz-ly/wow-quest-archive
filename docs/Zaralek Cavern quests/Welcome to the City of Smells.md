==Description==
Ain't it incredible, uplander!

Now for the backbreaking labor. We've got to deliver this deepflayer meat to all my customers and collect their pay. I'd carry it all myself, but I'm just a poor, old, frail, gorgeous woman in need now, aren't I?

<[[Elder Honeypelt|Honeypelt]] gives you an expertly practiced wink.>

Why don't you handle it for me? [[Brynnsahce]] will do the heavy lifting while you take a little tour of the place. Put your best smell forward--we're a friendly sort!

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Scaled Titan's Claw]]
*[[Proto-Drake Slicer]]
*[[Earth-Bound Saber]]
*[[Stone Spitter]]
*[[Black Dragon's Reach]]
*[[Earth Warding Spire]]
*[[Draconic Cleaver]]
*[[Centered Stone Focus]]
*[[Almost Immovable Wall]]
*[[Black Earth Glaive]]

You will also receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* +200 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

==Progress==
It'd be a waste not to keep those nostrils open here in Loamm!

==Completion==
Not too shabby, kid. Maybe there's room for you on the monster hunting roster, yet!

Just kidding! Another joke! There is no roster! Just combat-hungry suckers who got rocks rolling 'round their gut like I do.

You'll get there one day. Keep trying.

==Notes==
[[Brynnsahce]] is next to Honeypelt:
:Have you introduced yourself to the High Redolence yet? She don't bite or nothing!
:{{gossip|Ready to deliver!}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Woah... You smell completely different to anything I've ever smelled. Even Elder Honeypelt doesn't come back with scents this unexpected.}}
:{{text|say|Aurantia|Why don't we all move to Carrilion Belfry? We're clogging up the streets here.}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Anyway!  I'll be your guide in Loamm.  Let me show you why Elder Honeypelt chose me as her monster hunter apprentice!}}
:''The players all move north.''

[[Myrrit]], the cave diver, is to the southwest:
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Myrrit! Noses up!}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|My Deepflayer snackaroos! And fresh!}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|I got your payment around here somewhere. One sec...}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Myrrit always brings the best treasure back from his digs.}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Is this it? Hard to see down here...}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|No, no. This one! Right...?}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Oh, of course! I left them under my bed!}}
:''Myrrit dives under the ground and pops up a few dirt piles of "Treasure?" and "Treasure!"''

Interact with the Treasure! dirt pile to continue:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Thanks again, Brynn!}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Luck to ya on your next sniffenseek!}}

[[File:Welcome to the City of Smells - Gloowaz and Magk.jpg|thumb|[[Gloowaz Bonesmusher]] and [[Quicksmack Magk]]]]
The coach [[Gloowaz Bonesmusher]] and his trainee [[Quicksmack Magk]] are to the southeast:
:{{text|say|Gloowaz Bonesmusher|Perfect timing, Brynn! My trainee here needs a suitable sparring partner. I'll pay you for the goods after.}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Sorry, Coach! My hands are full, but <name> should be up for it.}}
:{{text|say|Gloowaz Bonesmusher|Get in there, Magk!}}
:{{text|say|Quicksmack Magk|Use any weapons you need to, bud!}}

Speak with Magk:
:Ready when you are!
:{{gossip|Let's give it our best!}}

Fend him off:
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Thank ya, thank ya. Have a good one, Coach. You too, Magk!}}
:{{text|say|Gloowaz Bonesmusher|Hey! Come back if you ever thinkin' about going pro, <name>!}}
:{{text|say|Gloowaz Bonesmusher|You'll get there, kid. Let's take a protein break and bulk up. What do we say when we lose?}}
:{{text|say|Quicksmack Magk|The only way to heal an injury is to get a worse one!}}
:{{text|say|Gloowaz Bonesmusher|That's the spirit, kid!}}

[[File:Welcome to the City of Smells - Talpi and Gumm.jpg|thumb|[[Tale-Teller Talpi]] and [[Gumm]]]]
The teacher [[Tale-Teller Talpi]] is to the northeast, overwhelmed by [[Gumm]], who is jumping around:
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Hey hey, everyone!-- Woah! What's going on here, Talpi?!}}
:{{text|say|Tale-Teller Talpi|Someone fed Gumm rock candy again. I'd pay ya for your goods, but the little dirt digger stole my crystal pouch.}}
:{{text|say|Gumm|Hehehehe!}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Not a worry! <name> here will catch him. He's quick like a rock viper!}}
:{{text|say|Apprentice Dae|SOMEONE STOP HIM! PLEASE!}}

Gumm is leaping from stool to stool. Catch him when he lands:
:{{text|say|Gumm|Fine, take it! That crystal don' even smell like anything anyway.}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|It's okay, little ones. Why not take an early lunch!}}
:{{text|say|Tale-Teller Talpi|Everyone say "Thank you, mister Brynnsahce and uplander friend."}}
:{{text|say|Gumm|Thank you, mister Brynnsahce and uplander friend!}}
:{{text|say|Apprentice Dae|Thank you, mister Brynnsahce and uplander friend!}}
:{{text|say|Studious Niffen|Thank you, mister Brynnsahce and uplander friend!}}
:{{text|say|Studious Niffen (2)|Thank you, mister Brynnsahce and uplander friend!}}
:{{text|say|Studious Niffen (3)|Thank you, mister Brynnsahce and uplander friend!}}

Nearby, [[Ponzo]] starts [[Get Rich Quick]], an optional side quest.

[[File:Welcome to the City of Smells - Cenka.jpg|thumb|[[Cenka]] and the slug jar]]
[[Cenka]], the resourceful chef, is to the northwest:
:{{text|say|Cenka|Brynnsahce, ma boy!}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Hey howdy there, Cenka! I can smell that delicious Zaralek slug stew from the other side of town!}}
:{{text|say|Cenka|Much appreciated, but you know it needs some o' old Honeypelt's deepflayer meat for these Niffen to really dig it.}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|I got your goods, if you got the payment.}}
:{{text|say|Cenka|Ah, you know what I did? I went and left it in my slug jar behind me again! You're gonna have to dig it out.}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Again? How do you even do that?!}}

Interact with the slug jar behind Cenka:
:{{text|say|Cenka|WAAAAH! SLUGS CAN GROW WINGS?!}}
:''A whole bunch of [[Runaway Meal]] moths pop out!''
:{{text|say|Cenka|GET 'EM BRYNN!}}

Defeat the moths:
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|CENKA! STOP PUTTING YOUR CRYSTALS IN THE SLUG JAR!}}
:{{text|say|Cenka|Hmm, maybe that was an overreaction.}}
:{{text|say|Cenka|Till next time, Brynn!}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Can you believe that guy?}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Smelling your reactions to everything in Loamm made me appreciate the familiar in a whole new way. Way to go, Uplander!}}

;Description
Pretty incredible, right kid?

I've gotta trade these parts I reclaimed from our big deepflayer trophy back there to all my customers. AND collect their pay.  But I'm just a poor, old, frail, gorgeous woman in need now, aren't I?

<Honeypelt winks at you. You can tell she's an expert at winking.>
