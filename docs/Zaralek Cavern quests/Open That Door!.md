==Objectives==
Talk to [[Rannan Korren|Rannan]] about his progress.
* Ask Rannan about his progress
* Door opened
* Enter the vault with Emberthal

==Description==
I am glad we are making progress but... I cannot shake a sense of foreboding of what awaits us inside. As [[Sarkareth]] learns about [[Neltharion]], his intentions seem to get ever darker...

I can only imagine what he is telling his people now--about me and about the other [[dracthyr]]. He will fracture our people forever.

Talk to Rannan and see how much longer we have to wait. We can't waste more time.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +50 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Completion==
Sarkareth would not have come here alone, <name>. I advise that you stay close and stay sharp.

==Notes==
Speak with Rannan:
:This door... what a marvel of ingenuity! It's ancient, but the [[technology]]...
:Don't tell the others, but this is the first time I have seen one outside of a book. 
:Oh, don't give me that look. Doors have worked the same way for millennia.
:And I have a plan!
:{{gossip|How close are you to getting the door open?}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|I was just about to give it a try! Now let's see, hmm... woosh!}}
:{{text|say|Vault Observation Executor|Vault Observation eXecutor, VOX, is online. Submit query.}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|Hey! Nice acronym. VOX... I'll have to remember that for one of my inventions later...}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|I am Rannan Korren of the Dragonscale Expedition and a really important person. Uh, please let me in?}}
:{{text|say|Vault Observation Executor|Querent unknown. Access denied.}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|Oof... Ebyssian, you try it. If this place belonged to Neltharion, maybe it will let a dragon in.}}
:{{text|say|[[Ebyssian]]|My name is Ebyssian, son of... Neltharion and the [[black dragonflight]]. I wish to enter.}}
:{{text|say|Vault Observation Executor|Querent unknown. Access denied.}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|Huh. That's weird.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|We do not have time for this, Rannan. Please get the door open.}}
:{{text|say|Vault Observation Executor|Querent identified. Welcome, Scalecommander Emberthal.}}
:''The door opens.''
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|Well, what do you know? Why didn't you say you could open the door?}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I am as confused as you are. How does it know who I am?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Neltharion's safety measures. Only his high-ranking soldiers are allowed in. It would explain how Sarkareth gained access.}}
:''Emberthal and Ebyssian walk in. Rannan takes up by the two niffen.''
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|Yeah, and while you storm the vault I'll... uh...  stay here with Tubes and Perisimona and, uh, protect them from... stuff.}}

Rannon has new gossip after the dialogue is finished
:All of you need to finish whatever business you have in there so the three of us can go in and take a look.
:I know there has to be some sweet titan artifacts in there to study, and I'm just... vibrating in my boots I'm so excited.
:What does it look like in there? Can you see?
:Ugh, I do NOT do waiting well. Hnnngg!
