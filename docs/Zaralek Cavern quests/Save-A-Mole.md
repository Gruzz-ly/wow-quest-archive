[[File:Save-A-Mole.jpg|thumb|[[Rannan Korren]] and [[Tuberros]], captured]]

==Objectives==
Find and save Tuberros and his uplander client.
* [[Tuberros]] found {{co|58.1|75.4|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
[[Perisimona]] told me about her life-mate, Tuberros, and what she knows about his disappearance.

Tuberros was guiding a client from the [[Dragonscale Expedition]] around some ruins here. It sounds as though they may have run into the [[Sundered Flame]].

I would rather not go after the Sundered Flame myself. Doing so would announce my presence to [[Scalecommander Sarkareth|Sarkareth]].

Will you aid us by finding and rescuing Tuberros and his client? Maybe then he can help guide us to [[Nal ks'kol|Neltharion's vault]].

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Endowed Sash]]
*[[Inherited Cincture]]
*[[Bequeathed Cinch]]
*[[Bestowed Girdle]]

You will also receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Were you able to find them?

==Completion==
It is time to get back to why we are here, and that is finding Sarkareth. 

I will send the Niffen and Rannan back to Loamm, where it is safe.

==Notes and trivia==
Head south into the [[Sundered Flame Camp]]. At the southwestern end of the quest area, look inside the small cave to find [[Tuberros]] and [[Rannan Korren]] from the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]. Speak with Tuberros:
:Rude Sundered whatsits. They snuck up on us! My nose wasn't used to their scent and...
:I said I'd be a guide and bodyguard, but I don't give refunds for unforeseen circumstances!
:{{gossip|It's okay. I'm here to free you.}}
:{{text|say|Tuberros|Oh! Thank the Kithmane! You've freed us!}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|Hah! Thank you for saving us... ah...?}}
:{{text|say|Tuberros|We need to get out of here. I can smell my grubnector near by!}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|Your... grubnector?}}
:{{text|say|Tuberros|I mean my... Nevermind. Just follow me!}}
:''They run off.''

Before being freed, Rannan has gossip:
:One moment Tubes and I were looking at some titan ruins, and then bang! The lights went out and I ended up here!
:They put a sack on my head! It was so dark! I couldn't see anything!

Return to Emberthal and Perisimona, where Tuberros and Korren have returned:
:{{text|say|Tuberros|Grubnector! I knew I smelled your scent!}}
:{{text|say|Perisimona|Snailykins! You're alright! I thought I'd never smell your scent again!}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|I thought Grubnector was some sort of food. How is that a pet name?}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I... don't want to interrupt your reunion, but...}}

Rannan has gossip after being rescued:
:The Sundered Flame had so much information in their camp! Where and how they gathered all of it is beyond me!
:I rummaged through some of their findings and read of a place called Aberrus where shady things you wouldn't believe took place! 
:Then my guide, Tubes, said something about hiding just before the burlap sack came down on my head! 
:They could have atleast washed it, but no. Have you ever smelled the inside of a used burlap sack before? One advice - Don't!

The quest name is a reference to the arcade game {{wplink|Whac-A-Mole}}.
