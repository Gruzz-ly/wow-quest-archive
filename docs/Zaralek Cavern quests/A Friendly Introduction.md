==Objectives==
Deliver the harvest and introduce [[Agrul]] to [[Yarren]].
* Harvest delivered {{co|51.0|74.2|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Introduce Agrul to Yarren

==Description==
It's time to deliver the harvest to the hermit. When he sees what good work we did, maybe he'll hire me as a farmhand!

I, uh... tried talking to him once before. Wanted to ask if he needed a helper.

Doesn't seem to like guests, though. Especially [[drogbar]]. So I got nervous and ran off.

You were looking for his mouse. Could you introduce us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
You have to find Persii before it's too late!

==Completion==
That drogbar ran off because he's guilty. I'm sure of it!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Agrul|I'll meet you at the hermit's hovel!}}
:''Agrul runs north to the hovel.''

Interact with the [[Empty Storage Crate]] between Yarren and Agrul to deliver the harvest of glow spores, then speak with Yarren:
:Have you found Persii?
:{{gossip|quest=|<Introduce Agrul.>}}
:{{text|say|Yarren|Who's this drogbar? I don't abide strangers on my property!}}
:{{text|say|Agrul|Hello, Yarren. Looks like you could use some help around here. Would you hire me to be your farmhand?}}
:{{text|say|Yarren|That voice... YOU! I know you were there! You took Persii from me!}}
:{{text|say|Agrul|I didn't want to! Honest! But I... I can fix this!}}
:''Agrul runs off.''

==Progression==
{{Hermit's Hovel}}
