==Objectives==
Eliminate 10 Ghostly Researchers and Failed Experiments in the [[Acidbite Ravine]].
* [[Failed Experiment (Zaralek Cavern)|Failed Experiment]]s or [[Ghostly Researcher]]s slain (10)

==Description==
We need to give these creatures peace.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
I am sorry to ask this of you, <name>.

==Completion==
Thank you <name>.

What was done here... I am worried about Voraxian.

I am glad you went with him.

==Notes==
Pick up all three quests before heading out. Voraxian provides a buff:
:{{Abilities|Voraxian's Enveloping Scales|Voraxian has empowered you with the strength of his flight. Armor is increased by 1,000. Maximum Health is increased by 50%.|id=411801|icon=ability_monk_dragonkick}}

Get to killing, capturing evidence, and totem placing. Head north along the river to turn in.

On return:
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|Ok, everyone! Take your places. We should start this ritual as soon as we can.}}

==Progression==
{{Medicinal Fungi}}
