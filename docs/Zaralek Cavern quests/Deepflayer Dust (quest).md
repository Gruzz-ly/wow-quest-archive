==Objectives==
Collect 10 Deepflayer Dust and deliver them to [[Mistie]] in [[Loamm]].
*[[Deepflayer Dust]] (10)

==Description==
Why, I just got another letter from my good friend Mistie. She's been looking for interesting ingredient ideas for her smelly concoctions!

A while ago, the kithguards took down a [[deepflayer]] near Loamm. I noticed a peculiar dust it shed when it perished. It had a unique aroma to it, and I'm sure Mistie would love to experiment with something like that!

Could you gather some from the deepflayers near Loamm, then bring it to Miss Mistie? You'll be doing us a favor, too!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Alchemy Notes
}}

==Progress==
Such a mysterious musty aroma... the grim note of death alongside the gentleness of soil.

==Completion==
Oh yes, this'll do nicely! Can you smell that with your nose? It's very fragrant!
