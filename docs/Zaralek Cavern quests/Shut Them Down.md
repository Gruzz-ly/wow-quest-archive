[[File:Shut Them Down.jpg|thumb|[[Primalist Stonegrinder]]s, [[Earthrender Conduit]]s, and [[Igira]]]]

==Objectives==
Destroy 3 Earthdrainer Conduits and 4 Extracted Elemental Cores.
* [[Earthdrainer Conduit]] destroyed (3) {{co|29.5|54.3|Zaralek Cavern}}
* [[Extracted Elemental Core]] destroyed (4)

==Description==
[[File:Extracted Elemental Core.jpg|thumb|upright|Extracted Elemental Core]]

Up ahead, the [[Primalists]] are working to awaken the [[Igira|Zaqali's final elder]].

When we used the farsight totem earlier, I observed that they were draining something from the elder. Now I realize it is likely an attempt to dispel the magic keeping the elder in stasis. They are using elemental cores to contain the magic in the same way we did to cleanse [[Sabellian]].

[[Fyrakk]] absorbing [[shadowflame]] is disastrous. We cannot add an elder awakening to that threat. We must halt their efforts.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I cannot be certain if this will stop them entirely, but it will at least slow their progress.

==Completion==
I hope we have bought ourselves enough time to gather reinforcements.

==Notes==

On accept:
:''Ebyssian and Sabellian join the party.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Sabellian, how is your pain?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I am still injured, but the shadowflame... It is gone. I no longer feel it creeping towards my soul.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|We acted quickly enough then. You are cleansed.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I feared the worst. I feared I would end up like [[Deathwing|him]].}}

Players again have the Protection of the Ebon Flight buff while on these quests:
:{{Abilities|Protection of the Ebon Flight|Health increased by 200%. Damage taken reduced by 80%. Immune to knockback effects. Regenerating 2% health every 3 sec.|id=403726|icon=inv_icon_wing08e}}

For an easter egg, consider emoting <code>/rude</code> at [[Fyrakk]]:
:{{text|whisper|Fyrakk|HAHAHA!!}}
:{{Abilities|Roasted|Fyrakk is amused by your actions.|id=401533|icon=inv_fyrakk_dragonbreath|notes=Hits for 50% of max health and causes a 10-second debuff: Burning for 2 Shadowflame damage every 2 sec. Healing taken reduced by 100%.}}

Kill a path up the hill to the west-northwest to find the extracted elemental cores. To the south of the marked quest area is [[Igira]], being channeled by three [[Primalist Stonegrinder]]s using  [[Earthrender Conduit]]s. Kill the Primalists and destroy the conduits:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|It is fortunate that this elder still slumbers. The size of that spear beside her...}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I wonder, if she were awake would she use it on Fyrakk's behalf or stab him with it?}}

==Progression==
{{The Ancient Bargain}}
