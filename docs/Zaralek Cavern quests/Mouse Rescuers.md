==Objectives==
{{Questportrait|Malrogg.jpg|Malrogg|Agrul's (former) employer and sniffing mouse thief.}}
Kill Malrogg.
* [[Malrogg]] slain {{co|46.4|80.5|Zaralek Cavern}}
* [[Persii]] found
* [[Agrul]] followed

==Description==
I feel bad for everything I did working for Malrogg. He was just so big and scary, I never felt like I had a choice...

<Agrul slowly shakes his head.>

No more excuses. We need to get that sniffin' mouse back home to [[Yarren]].

I was never strong enough to take on Malrogg alone. But you... You can save Persii.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 71,350 [[XP]]
* [[Farmhand's Abundant Harvest]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Did you find that drogbar?

==Completion==
I can't thank you both enough for saving Persii!

==Notes==
Head inside the cave to find Malrogg:
:{{text|say|Malrogg|Back off, brul! This sniffin' mouse is mine!}}

Defeat him:
:{{text|say|Malrogg|Stinkin'... mousie...}}

Return outside to catch up with Agrul and Persii:
:{{text|say|Agrul|I'm finally free of Malrogg's threats. Thank you.}}
:{{text|say|Agrul|Persii! Wait for us!}}
:''They run off.''

Return to the [[Hermit's Hovel]]:
:{{text|say|Yarren|You brought Persii back home?}}
:{{text|say|Agrul|Yeah. I never wanted to help Malrogg. But I... I was scared of him. I'm real sorry, Yarren.}}
:{{text|say|Agrul|I know you've got no reason to trust me. But I'd still like to be your farmhand... if you'll have me.}}
:{{text|say|Yarren|It was a brave thing you did, standing up to that bully and saving my mouse. I'm grateful for that.}}
:{{text|say|Yarren|Well... I suppose I could use a hand around here. Persii's a good sniffer, but she ain't much use for lifting heavy things!}}
:{{text|say|Agrul|I won't let you down!}}

On complete, Agrul walks off. He has new gossip once he makes it back out into the pasture:
:{{gossip|Do you like being a farmhand?}}
:Yarren's a lot nicer than my last boss.
:He's grumpy sometimes, but he's never cruel like Malrogg was. And he makes sure I've had enough to eat before I go work in the field!
:I think Yarren actually likes having me around. You know how I know? He says that Persii's gotten attached to me.
:Anyway, the work is hard, but it makes me feel good. Like I'm really helping someone. Making up for the bad stuff I did before.
:At least, I hope I am.
