:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Myrrit|I smell Daffydil and Melati. They're sniffenseekers too! Do you see them?}}
:{{Text|yell|Melati|Eeeeeeeeee!}}
:{{Text|say|Daffydil|Watch out, there's monsters lurking. One of them stole my key right out of my claws!}}
:{{Text|say|Melati|It frightened me...}}
:{{Text|say|Daffydil|I got a good scent of it before it tunneled. It wasn't a worm.}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|<Name>, let's see if Daffydil has any more information for us.}}

Melati's gossip
:If you slay the monster, the treasure is yours. We're not going to kill it, that's for sure!

Speak with Daffydil:
:The treasure was taken by a digging creature!

:{{Gossip|quest=|What kind of smell was it?}}
::It was a fishy smell, like a rotten lake--but it wasn't a fish.

:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Let's be careful with where we dig, <name>, and use my sniff-skills!}}

Avoid green gas that gives the Choking debuff and bar. Use Sniff, follow the trail, and then use Burrow.
*{{Text|say|Myrrit|Woof! That is a strong musk smell!}}
*{{Text|say|Myrrit|Mmm! Is that... rosemary?}}
*{{Text|say|Myrrit|Ugh! That oily smell is overpowering.}}

Burrowing may reveal [[Rock Burrower]]s, [[Skulking Lasher]]s, or [[Billi Cogscrabber]].
*{{Text|say|Myrrit|He looks just like Mr. Smelly!}}
*{{Text|say|Billi Cogscrabber|Hey, I'm diggin' here! Hmph!}}

Repeat the process until [[Bogg]] who drops the key is found:
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|I smell something briny over here...}}
:{{Text|yell|Melati|Oh no, the monster! Run, Daffs!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Hold on-- I need to heal up.}}

;Treasure Chest opened
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|I'm glad my nose came in handy. Effie usually did most of the sniffin'.}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|We're a great team--strong and sniff-tastic!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Let's head back to town.}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|We got the goodies, right? Pick me up when you're ready to go!}}
