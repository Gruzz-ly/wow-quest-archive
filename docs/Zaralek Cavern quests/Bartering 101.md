==Objectives==
Deliver [[Ponzo]]'s box to [[Kayann]] in [[Valdrakken]].

==Description==
So here's what I need you to do.

A friend of mine, Kayann, went all the way up to Valdrakken. He's expecting a delivery from me. Can you get it to him?

No questions, though. Don't look, don't smell, don't taste. This is for Kayann's nose only!

If that's all right with you, I'll send you on your way--with my thanks, of course!

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will receive:|Barter Brick
}}

==Completion==
I know a Ponzo box when I smell a Ponzo box!

Thanks for bringing it up--quite the trip! Here's something Ponzo will love to trade for.
