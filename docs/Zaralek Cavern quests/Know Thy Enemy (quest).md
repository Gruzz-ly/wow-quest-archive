[[File:Know Thy Enemy.jpg|thumb|Zaqali djaradin]]

==Objectives==
Gather 8 pieces of Zaqali equipment from Zaqali [[djaradin]] near the empty shrine.
* Zaqali armaments (8)

==Description==
That djaradin called her people the "[[Zaqali tribe|Zaqali]]"--but my troops did not report any information regarding a second active djaradin [[tribe]] in the [[Dragon Isles]]. I detest an unknown in war.

We will need to learn what we can about them--and quickly--in order to assess their strengths and weaknesses. I have found the best way to know a culture is to examine how they make war.

Slay any you find in the nearby area and take their armaments. I will expect your report.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Scaled Titan's Tooth]]
*[[Proto-Drake Ripper]]
*[[Dragon Maul]]
*[[Dark Earth Glaive]]
*[[Nearly Unbreakable Wall]]
*[[Dark Nail]]
*[[Staff of the Unlit Sky]]
*[[Grounded Stone Focus]]
*[[Rock Shooter]]
*[[Wand of Shifting Stone]]

You also will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
No detail about an enemy is insignificant. Everything can be used against them.

==Completion==
These Zaqali are far more magically talented than the Qalashi, it seems.

Bothersome.

The beast we knew would have been preferable to the beast we do not, but I will adapt our strategies accordingly.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I will scout ahead and identify our next target.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|<Name>, let us make our way to the empty shrine below.}}
:''Ebyssian joins the player and Sabellian runs off.''

While on these quests, players are buffed with:
:{{Abilities|Protection of Ebon Flight|Health increased by 200%. Damage taken reduced by 80%. Immune to knockback effects. Regenerating 2% health every 3 sec.|id=403726|icon=inv_icon_wing08e}}

Defeat Zaqali in the area for their Zaqali equipment, including: [[Black Dragonscale Robes]], [[Dragonbone Totem]], [[Draketooth Fetish]], [[Obsidian Prayer Beads]], and [[Volcanic Herb Sachet]] which collectively serve as [[Zaqali Equipment]] for this quest. Ebyssian will help!

Once done with the kill quota and the other quest, catch up Sabellian inside a small cave that has a dead [[Massive Corebeast]] and (spoiler alert!) a [[Spirit Healer]] in it:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Sabellian! What happened here?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|We required this cave to stay undetected, and the beast would have raised the alarm.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I suppose... what is done is done.}}

==Progression==
