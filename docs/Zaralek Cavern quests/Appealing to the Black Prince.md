[[File:Appealing to the Black Prince.jpg|thumb|[[Ebyssian]] and [[Wrathion]] at [[Obsidian Rest]]]]

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Wrathion]] at the [[Obsidian Rest]].
* Speak to Wrathion {{co|51.5|25.8|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
Our assault will not be successful without the stealth and cunning of Wrathion and his [[Blacktalon]] agents. We must convince him to help us.

Thankfully, I know in his heart he will not deny someone in need--especially if they flatter him.

Let us go to Wrathion at the Obsidian Rest and try to sway him.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +1000 reputation with [[Wrathion (faction)|Wrathion]]

==Progress==
I only hope that his temper has cooled by now.

==Completion==
I am glad to have him by our side.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I will see you at the entrance to [[Brimstone Garrison]], [[Sabellian]].}}
:''Ebyssian shifts back to dragon form and flies away.''

Before leaving, Sabellian has new gossip:
:It wouldn't be the first time I would have to raise arms against those with misguided loyalties.

Find Wrathion outside the inn of Obsidian Rest:
:I always keep the best interests of [[Black dragonflight|my flight]] in mind.
:{{gossip|quest=|Ebyssian would like to speak to you.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Ebyssian! What a joy to see you again so soon.}}
:''Ebyssian lands and shifts back to his visage form.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|The time is now, Wrathion. Are you prepared for battle?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Color me intrigued. Is this about [[Aberrus]]?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|The forces of Aberrus stand against us all. I need your strength to break it--yours, and that of the Blacktalon.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Yes, of course... We must secure Aberrus. But I fear what I will see inside.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I cannot do this without your strength, Wrathion. We must all stand together if we wish to succeed.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|You are right. Annoyingly, you usually are. Rest assured the Blacktalon--and my talons-- will be where you need them.}}

Ebyssian has a new gossip:
:I am pleased to see us working as one, finally. I hope this is a sign of a united future.

==Progression==
{{Inevitable Confrontation}}
