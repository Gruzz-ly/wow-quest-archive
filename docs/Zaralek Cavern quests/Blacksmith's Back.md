==Description==
The kith of Loamm request the skills of a seasoned [[Smith|blacksmith]]! We've heard of the wonders you uplanders make with smelted [[ore]]!

Our Kilnmaster, Mister Crubus, has heard you have devised a way to dig without claws or earth [[magic]]! What a wonderful invention!

Please deliver some of these "shovels" as soon as you can, won't you?

==Progress==
Who are you? Oh, [[Kayann]] sent you?

Well, do you have what I asked for or what?

==Completion==
So these are those... What did you call them? Shovels?

And you hold them in your hands, and move dirt with them? Huh.

I'll be honest with you, friend. I'm an old [[niffen]]. I'm hoping these will spare me from bending over so much.

Well, here goes nothing!
