'''Fyrakk's Forces''' introduces players to [[Fyrakk Assaults]] in the [[Ohn'ahran Plains]] and [[Azure Span]].

==Objectives==
Journey to a [[Fyrakk Assaults|Suffusion Camp]].

==Description==
Champion, [[Fyrakk]] and his [[Primalist]] allies have struck a dark bargain with the [[djaradin]]. We have received word that their forces are assaulting the Dragon Isles in search of resources for some nefarious project.

Please, Champion, find one of these Suffusion Camps and assist any of our allies you can find there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
<!-- 
==Completion==
Welcome Champion! Your aid would be appreciated.
 -->
==Notes==
On accept, the image of Kalecgos teleports away. Head to the active Fyrakk Assault for the week, either [[Suffusion Camp: Cinderwind]] in southeastern [[Ohn'ahran Plains]] or [[Suffusion Camp: Frostburn]] in central [[Azure Span]].

Interacting with the "quest-ender" instantly ends the quest and offers the followup, [[Suffusion Camp]].
