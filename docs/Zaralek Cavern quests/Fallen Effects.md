After picking up any of [[Medicinal Fungi]], [[Healing Crystals]], or [[Satiating Sharpbeak]] at [[Dragonscale Camp]] in southwestern [[Zaralek Cavern]], head north-northeast into the [[Sulfur Wastes]] to find the corpse of [[Sheridon Hastle]]. His corpse has this gossip:
:<Before you lies the body of a Wildhammer dwarf dressed in Dragonscale Explorers attire.
:It has clearly been stabbed multiple times with djaradin weapons. This must be their dead camp member Sheridon Hastle. 
:You imagine the Dragonscale camp members would like his effects returned.>
