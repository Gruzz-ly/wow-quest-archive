==Objectives==
Find experts from both [[Loamm]] and the [[black dragonflight]] to weigh in on your find.
*[[Archivist Edress]] Informed {{co|52.7|26.3|Zaralek Cavern}}
*[[Kiln-Singer Malraka]] Informed {{co|57.8|54.3|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
Well, there's two factors at play here, eh? 

We should do our due diligence and figure out who this was a statue of. But between you and me? 

I'm much more interested in learning about the jokesters that turned it into this work of art. I'm sure there's a historian of the black dragonflight somewhere near [[Aberrus]]. And why don't you poke around Loamm to see if there are any stories surrounding this kind of... artistic license.

==Rewards==
You will unlock access to the following:
: {{abilities|Azerothian Archives: Gaze of Neltharion, Zaralek Cavern Site|Unlock the Azerothian Archives' World Quests at the Gaze of Neltharion of Zaralek Cavern.}}

You will also receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

==Progress==
<Roska looks pleased with your work.>

==Completion==
We'll keep up the dig around the tower.

There's still an awful lot of midden to go through. Even if we don't find something this spectacular again, we've got a lot to learn about the niffen and how they lived before and during the dragons leaving.

But I think we've done a good day's work for now!

==Notes==
Speak with [[Archivist Edress]] at [[Obsidian Rest]]:
{{book|content=
The Obsidian Citadel was a monument to the black dragonflight's history.

But Aberrus... Aberrus is a trove of uncharted research. Terrible and horrendous research, yes, but fascinating nonetheless.

:{{text|say|Archivist Edress|Ah... I see. Well, now no one can ever claim history is not interesting.}}
:{{text|say|Archivist Edress|The statue could represent any number of individuals even if we could discern what was beneath the "additions."}}
:{{text|say|Archivist Edress|I need to see it firsthand. I shall make travel arrangements and meet you there.}}

Speak with [[Kiln-Singer Malraka]] in [[Niffen]]:
{{book|content=
The most important thing is keeping your nose focused on the pottery in front of you.

:{{text|say|Kiln-Singer Malraka|Ah ha ha, what a hoot! My grandmother would tell tales of the Bristle Brigands when I was just a pup.}}
:{{text|say|Kiln-Singer Malraka|The paint though... That's what intrigues me. How could that have survived so long?}}
:{{text|say|Kiln-Singer Malraka|Let me finish up this pot, and I'll meet you back at the site.}}

Return to the excavation site:
:{{text|say|Archivist Edress|Ah, dear me. I'm afraid the details are so eroded we may never know who this represented.}}
:{{text|say|Kiln-Singer Malraka|Oh, bless you for trying, dear. This incredible pigment is a find of its own even if we don't know who it was!}}
:{{text|say|Kiln-Singer Malraka|If I can take a sample, maybe I can figure out how the niffen of old made such vibrant pottery!}}
:{{text|say|Archivist Edress|I am glad then that at least our loss is your gain! In truth any new knowledge benefits us all even if it is unexpected!}}
