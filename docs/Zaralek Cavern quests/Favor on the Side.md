==Objectives==
Uncover 6 intruders and kick them off the Glimmerogg Games.
* Intruders Found (6)

==Description==
[[Brogg the Beast|Brogg]] counts more people than fees today. It's not sitting well with me neither. I'm gonna blow my top!

Sure, [[Glimmerogg]] is popular, but it's not all fun and games. We have rules and everyone must follow them.

You look like someone who can read fine print and follow rules. If you get rid of the intruders that are cheating Brogg, I may have something for you.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Did you get them all?

Brul, just because Brogg's big and strong doesn't mean that I can't count.

==Completion==
Brogg thanks your good eye and discipline, little brul. 

Remember to play by the rules... If a rock lifts by itself, somebody is cheating.

==Notes==
Speak with [[Festival Challenger]]s in the snail racing area. They can say one of:

*Entrance fee? Yeah, I heard it was optional for some people. Lucky me, huh?
*I don't pay to play. I play to WIN!
*My skills would speak for themselves. I'm too good for an entrance fee!
*Pay? I don't gotta pay. I have endorsements! From a shoe brand!<br> What do you mean, drogbar don't wear shoes?
*This year I will be the best. I was told the fee was waived for special guests like myself.
:{{gossip|quest=|You're a party crasher!}}

The challenger turns hostile!
*{{text|say|Festival Challenger|I'll put you in your place!}}
*{{text|say|Festival Challenger|You've made a big mistake!}}

Get the challenger to 20%:
*{{text|say|Festival Challenger|Enough! I have the money. Here, I'll pay right now!}}
*{{text|say|Festival Challenger|Wait, wait! I'll pay the fee! I'll do it!}}

On completion of both: 
:{{text|say|Brogg the Beast|Talk to the others if you want to play some games, brul!}}

[[Storul Heavystone]] starts the next quest, [[Rock By Rock]].
