'''Smelly Scramble''' is a bonus objective that takes place at {{co|57.7|56.2|Zaralek Cavern}} in [[Loamm]] of east-central [[Zaralek Cavern]], announced with a zone-wide emote: {{text|emote|Muskmettle the Smellomancer is getting ready to brew!}}

==Objectives==
*Muskmettle's concotion{{sic}} made by returning smellies to pot

==Description==
The Smellomancer has begun brewing his stink!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 3x [[Fragrant Unearthed Coin]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
*[[Clinking Dirt-Covered Pouch]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|yell|Muskmettle the Smellomancer|IT'S TIME! This shall be the GREATEST, the SMELLIEST concoction ever made! JOIN ME, FRIENDS!}}

[[Muskmettle the Smellomancer]] is standing by his pot that has a Smelliness progress bar over it and is tossing smellibubbles into swirlies nearby.

Get hit by one, then immediately use the extra action button to throw it elsewhere:
:{{Abilities|Throw Smellibubble|Throw a smelly to increase its stench contribution.|id=407352|icon=inv_eng_bombpoison|notes=Instant|range=10-20}}

Each second players are holding the bubble, they take damage:
:{{Abilities|Unbearable Stench|Holding a smelly. The stench is unbearable!|id=407189|icon=inv_eng_bombpoison|notes=10 sec debuff. Deals 9% of max health every second.}}

The objective is to hop-scotch the smellibubbles back to the pot. Players are rooted while they are holding the bubble, so they must use the extra action button to throw it forward. Other players can stand in the landing spot to quickly toss it forward, otherwise solo players can toss the bubble on the ground, then run up to it, click on it, and toss it forward again.

Randomly:
*{{text|say|Muskmettle the Smellomancer|Best way to make smellies? Toss the smellies around to many folks! Get all different smells in the smellies!}}
*{{text|say|Muskmettle the Smellomancer|Catch the smellies! Toss the smellies! DON'T LET THEM TOUCH THE GROUND!}}
*{{text|say|Muskmettle the Smellomancer|What's the best way to make smellies? Why, you toss the smellies around to lots of folks! Then you get different smells in your smellies!}}
*{{text|say|Muskmettle the Smellomancer|SMELLIES! Give them to your friends! Together, we'll make the BEST smelly!}}
*{{text|say|Muskmettle the Smellomancer|The longer the bounce, the smellier the smelly! Keep them in the air! Don't let them fall!}}
*{{text|say|Muskmettle the Smellomancer|YOU get a smelly! And YOU get a smelly!}}

On complete:
:{{text|yell|Muskmettle the Smellomancer|Yes, YES! Breathe in that REEK! DELICIOUS, INCREDIBLE!}}
:{{text|say|Muskmettle the Smellomancer|Please, friend, help yourself. Smell, smell!}}
