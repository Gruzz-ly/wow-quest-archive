==Objectives==
Complete [[Storul Heavystone]]'s weight lifting spree.
* Weight Bars lifted (3)

==Description==
Ah, a challenger! So, you think you can defeat in his famous rock-lifting marathon challenge? 

HA! Silly uplander. No one can compare to Storul! No one has EVER matched my strength.

But maybe you try. Defeat will teach you a valuable lesson: true strength comes from struggle!

Or, Storul will have a new friend to spot him at the gym! Get it, brul!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What? You're not afraid to lose, are you? Don't let fear consume you before you start.

Just do it, brul. Storul will give you a fair trial.

==Completion==
Good, brul, good! You a weakling no more! 

But even though you've proved you can lift as much as me, you're still not as great as Storul. 

Not yet.

There are more rocks ahead for a great challenger like you.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Storul Heavystone|Let's see what you're made of, <class>.}}
:{{text|say|Festival Challenger (1)|I bet you a snifter of mushy ooze they won't finish the lift marathon!}}
:{{text|say|Festival Challenger (2)|You're on, brul. But if they win, I get a glimm-o-tail on the rocks instead!}}

Pick up the [[Starter Weight Bar]] to get slightly pumped:
:{{text|say|Storul Heavystone|Good start. But you'll be waking up in pain tomorrow with that posture.}}
:{{text|say|Festival Challenger|Tsk, tsk... I can do better than that.}}

Next, go for the [[Mid-Weight Rock Bar]] to get fairly pumped:
:{{text|say|Storul Heavystone|Ok, brul. That one was decent. I guess you know a trick of two. Keep going...}}
:{{text|say|Festival Challenger|Yeah! Keep going, brul!}}

Finally, lift the [[Heavy Rock Bar]] to get extremely pumped:
:{{text|say|Storul Heavystone|Well, I'll be a rock's uncle. You did it! I knew you were stronger than you looked!}}
:{{text|say|Festival Challenger|That was cool! You rock!!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Festival Challenger (1)|So, when are you paying your bet, huh? Hehe...}}
:{{text|say|Festival Challenger (2)|Pff! Whatever, brul.}}
