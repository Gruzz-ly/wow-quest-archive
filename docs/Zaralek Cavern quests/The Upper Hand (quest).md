==Objectives==
Defeat [[Scalecommander Sarkareth]].
*Speak with [[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]]
*Sarkareth defeated

==Description==
It troubles me that [[Winglord Dezran|Dezran]] would sacrifice himself so willingly for Sarkareth... And that [[Amythora]] and [[Marithos]] would leave Dezran to save him.

We both know the loss of waking in a new world. But Sarkareth wallows in the darkness of our past. I cannot let him continue to recruit our people.

Sarkareth awaits in the next room. I do not wish to kill him, but we must bring him to justice.

Let me know when you are ready.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Endowed Slippers]]
*[[Inherited Treads]]
*[[Bequeathed Striders]]
*[[Bestowed Stompers]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 15x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +50 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Completion==
I now feel only pity for Sarkareth. Nothing was left of him but an empty husk, driven into madness.

==Notes==
Before picking up this quest, if you talk to [[Marithos]] and [[Amythora]], they have the following gossip.

If you talk to [[Marithos]]:
:The only reason we are not engaged in combat is because Sarkareth told me to wait.
:He has something in store for Emberthal.

If you talk to [[Amythora]]:
:I have heard enough about you and Scalecommander Emberthal!
:I will fight even if this is my last stand!

On accept:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|You go ahead, I will attend to Dezran's wounds and make sure he does not interfere.}}

Speak with Emberthal:
:Sarkareth is there. He has nowhere to go. Let me know when you are ready. We will do it together.
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}

After telling Emberthal to go, a script event plays out:

:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|VOX, initiate containment protocol.}}
:''Sarkareth walks the stairs, Oathbinder in hand.
:{{text|say|Vault Observation Executor|Compliance.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Still hiding in Ebyssian's shadow, I see.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Sarkareth... our conflict must end. Our people must unite.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|I agree.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Unite as we were meant to.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Bound to the hand of our father, Neltharion.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|The Oathbinder? Sarkareth, no!}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|You will all bow to ME!}}
:''Sarkareth uses the Oathbinder, stunning the three dracthyr.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Champion... I can't... you must stop him...}}
:{{RaceIcon|Dracthyr}}{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|You resist the Oathbinder?}}
:{{RaceIcon|Dracthyr}}{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|No matter, if you won't kneel, then you will die!}}

[[File:The Upper Hand - post-cutscene 1.jpg|thumb|Three stunned dracthyr and Sarkareth ready to fight]]
Fend off Sarkareth. Once he gets to 30%, a cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|OvJtKZXmI9k}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|No! Oathbinder... is MINE!}}
:''Sarakreth is on the ground, a yard or so away from [[Oathbinder]]. Emberthal gets to her feet and walks up to Sarkareth.''
:{{text|say|Emberthal|Is this why you came here? To enslave us again with Neltharion's devices? That's how you would create unity?}}
:''Emberthal stomps her left foot down on Oathbinder, shattering it!''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|What... have you done?}}
:''Sarkareth gets to his feet, bringing his left hand to his head.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Our father calls to us, Emberthal! Can you not hear Neltharion drawing us to Aberrus? Telling us to take what is ours?}}
:{{text|say|Emberthal|You are not well, Sarkareth... Come with me.  Perhaps Ebyssian can...}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|No! I will claim the legacy we were promised! VOX, initiate transport!}}
:''Sarkareth raises a hand to the ceiling and the camera cuts to show some titan devices spinning up.''
:{{text|say|VOX|Coordinates confirmed. Initiating transport.}}
:''Emberthal attempts to grab Sarkareth, but he teleports away before she can reach him.''
:{{text|say|Emberthal|Sarkareth, wait!}}
:''Now that the barrier blocking the hall is gone, Ebyssian runs into the room.''
:{{text|say|Emberthal|...He's gone. I... have accomplished nothing.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|This is not over yet. Do you know where he has gone?}}
:{{text|say|Emberthal|Ebyssian... he said he's hearing Neltharion's voice. He's going to Aberrus!}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Whispers in the dark. This may be worse than I'd imagined.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|But at least the dracthyr here are no longer under his control.}}
:''Marithos and Amythora walk forward as the scene fades to black.''

[[File:The Upper Hand - post-cutscene 2.jpg|thumb|Emberthal, Ebyssian, the Destroyed Oathbinder, with Marithos and Amythora in the background]]

After the cutscene, Ebyssian has gossip:
:Emberthal's path is that of pain and suffering but also of growth and learning. In the midst of it is Sarkareth.
:I hope that she will be able to find peace once this is over.
