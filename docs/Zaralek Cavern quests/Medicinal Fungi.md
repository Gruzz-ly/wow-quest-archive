[[File:Drooping Mushroom.jpg|thumb|Drooping Mushroom]]

;First time
:When we happened upon [[Dragonscale Camp|these poor souls]], it was clear they were attacked by [[djaradin]]. The poison on those brutes' weapons is preventing me and their leader, [[Earthmender Narvra|Narvra]], from healing them.
:I noticed peculiar mushrooms on some crystals nearby. I have seen their like before, and I may be able to fashion an antidote from them.
:Can you harvest some while [[Voraxian]] and I keep watch here?
;Other quests complete
:Young one? You being here is a pleasant surprise, if one I cannot fully appreciate right now.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Do you have the cuttings? I'm not sure how long these poor people have.

==Completion==
Thank you. This looks like what we need. 

It will take me a while to purge them, but we should be able to make it work.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|Thank you for...arg... stopping when you saw us. I can't heal them...}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|You are all severely wounded. Let me take a look...}}

On accept:
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|The djaradin attacked us as we hunted for artifacts. They were chasing a giant fire... thing that flew over us. Not all of us made it back.}}
:{{text|emote|Earthmender Narvra winces in pain.}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|This... this expedition is under my charge. I... can't let them down.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Rest. You have been poisoned. I will do what I can for your pain while <name> gathers ingredients for an antidote.}}

Pick up [[Satiating Sharpbeak]] and [[Healing Crystals]] before heading out.

Drooping Mushrooms are found growing on crystals all around the [[Viridian Throne]].

On return:
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|Maybe... maybe I can try a different healing spell...}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Save your strength. <Name> is returning. Once we neutralize the poison, we can work on healing you and your team.}}

After picking up any of the initial three quests, head north into the [[Sulfur Wastes]] to find the corpse of [[Sheridon Hastle]] at {{co|43.0|60.4|Zaralek Cavern}} just off the road. It has this gossip:
:<Before you lies the body of a Wildhammer dwarf dressed in Dragonscale Explorers attire.
:It has clearly been stabbed multiple times with djaradin weapons. This must be their dead camp member Sheridon Hastle. 
:You imagine the Dragonscale camp members would like his effects returned.>
:{{gossip|<Recover Sheridon's effects.>}}

Recovering [[Sheridon Hastle's Effects]] starts [[Fallen Effects]].
