[[File:Jar of Douserpowder.png|thumb|upright|Jar of Douserpowder]]
Some [[Excited Ember]]s have set [[Big Ol' Bessie]] on fire. Use a [[Jar of Douserpowder]] to help put out the fire with a 20-second buff and an extra action button:
:{{abilities|Throw Snuffer Powder|Helps put out fire.|id=405716|image=}}

While the event is in progress, Olfor randomly says:
*{{text|say|Olfor|No, Big Bessie! It's goin'ta be okay, darlin'. Please, someone help!}}
*{{text|say|Olfor|Quick, use this powder to snuff out the fire!}}
*{{text|say|Olfor|Help! Help! Please help!}}

Once the bar empties:
:{{text|say|Olfor|Oh, thank you so much, friends. There you go, old girl, it's alright now... You're so brave...}}

Players can then pet Big Ol' Bessie.
