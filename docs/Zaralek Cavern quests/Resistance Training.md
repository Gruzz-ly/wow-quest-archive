==Objectives==
Collect 5 Glowing Crystals, 5 Sulfuric Crystals, and 5 Magma Crystals from around [[Zaralek Cavern]].
* [[Glowing Crystal (item)]] (5) {{co|39|72|Zaralek Cavern}}
* [[Sulfuric Crystal]] (5) {{co|50|60|Zaralek Cavern}}
* [[Magma Crystal]] (5) {{co|43|54|Zaralek Cavern}} {{co|34|51|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
These caverns aren't easy on my poor snails, which is why I feed them a special crystal diet. Keeps their shells hard and gleaming. 

[[Big Slick in the City|Slick]] eats more than his fair share though, so I'm plumb out. 

Would you collect some crystals in Zaralek Cavern? Get a nice mix, too. We need to make sure Slicks ready for every environment.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Glimmerogg Racer]]

==Progress==
Everyone says they want their snails to have strong, healthy shells, but when it comes time to collect the crystals? They're too busy, they're too scared. 

Crokin' cowards..

==Completion==
That's the stuff! Just wait until you see how Slick's shell shines. Huh. Say that three times fast, am I right?

==Notes==
Four areas light up on the zone map: [[Viridian Throne]] for [[Glowing Crystal (item)]] (which also drop from [[Viridian Colossus|viridian colossi]] and [[Viridian Rager|ragers]]), the [[Sulfur Wastes]] for [[Sulfuric Crystal]], and the [[Molten Overflow]] and southern [[Zaqali Caldera]] for [[Magma Crystal]].
