'''Research: Djaradin of Zaralek Cavern''' is an [[Azerothian Archives]] world quest that is unlocked upon completion of [[The Scale of it All]]. It takes place at {{co|47|53|Zaralek Cavern}} at [[Igira's Watch]] in [[Zaralek Cavern]].

==Objectives==
* Speak with [[Coalo]] {{co|47.0|52.8|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Information Collected (0/100%)

==Description==
:{{text|say|[[Nirobin]]|Fortuitous timing! Stay close to my familiar and distract the hostiles while I perform my investigations.}}

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* {{cost|640}}
* +300 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Completion==
:{{text|say|Nirobin|That's enough for now. Let's resume again after I've logged this data... and washed the accumulated perspiration from my scales.}}

==Notes==
Interact with [[Coalo]] at the south end of the marked quest area, and it releases Clue Seekers all over. Go to each blue spot and use the Gain Clue extra action button to fill the bar. Also be on the look out for [[Juicy Clue]]s.

Completing this world quest adds a page to the [[Tome of Archived Isles Research]] at {{co|58.5|36.7|Thaldraszus}} in [[Nirobin]]'s office at [[Algeth'ar Academy]] in [[Thaldraszus]]:

{{book|content=Information acquired from the Igira's Watch, Zaralek Cavern, Dragon Isles, Azeroth:

I've uncovered a most unique relationship! An Iskaara tuskarr ventured to the Djaradin of Zaralek and initiated a trade agreement! Fish from the seas in return for powerful dragonslaying implements!}}

After completing the world quest a second time, the page is filled in with more information:

{{book|content= ﻿The Iskaara stockpiled these weapons over the course of months. The only reason I can verify for this is a djaradin phrase I've translated referring to the tuskarr's "fear of flame from many mouths."}}

After completing the world quest a third time, the page is completed:

{{book|content= Oh my... The fish were very well received by the djaradin. When the Iskaara trader stopped returning with more fish, a series of riots broke out and many structures were destroyed as a result.

It seems the popularity of lava pool fishing rose during this time as many djaradin decided to slake their desire for fish themselves!
