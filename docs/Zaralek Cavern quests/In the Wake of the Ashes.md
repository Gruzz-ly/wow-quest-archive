'''In the Wake of the Ashes''' concludes the "The Ancient Bargain" chapter of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]]. Chapter four, "Inherited Sin", begins next week with the direct follow-up: [[Here We Go Again (quest)]].

==Objectives==
Meet [[Ebyssian]] at the [[Seat of the Aspects]] in [[Valdrakken]].
* Report delivered

==Description==
We did all we could. We will return to help them rebuild, but for now... the people of [[Loamm]] need time to mourn.

[[Alexstrasza]] must be informed of what happened here today. She must be warned what has been unleashed upon the [[Dragon Isles]].

We will meet you at the Seat of the Aspects.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Endowed Hood]]
*[[Inherited Mask]]
*[[Bequeathed Cowl]]
*[[Bestowed Greathelm]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* [[Symbol of Friendship]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Everyone must know what happened.

It is the only way we can hope to prepare for the damage to come.

==Completion==
That is all we can do for now.

[[Sabellian]], [[Wrathion]], and I must plan our next steps as we prepare to return to [[Zaralek Cavern|Zaralek]].

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Ebyssian. What have I done?}}
:''Ebyssian walks to Sabellian.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|This was not your fault, Sabellian. Fyrakk would have caused this suffering regardless of our actions.}}
:''Wrathion runs up from the north.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I was unable to stop him. I have seen such slaughter before. It stays with you.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|What happened here? What have you all done? I leave you alone for a moment and--}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Wrathion! Not now. Let everyone recover. Let us mourn those that died because of this monster.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Come, my kin. We have a duty to report back to the Life-Binder. We must warn her that Fyrakk has been unleashed upon the Dragon Isles.}}
:''They all walk south into town and disappear into the distance.''

Return to [[Valdrakken]] and check in with [[Alexstrasza]] atop the [[Seat of the Aspects]]. She is in her dragon form, while the other dragons are in their visage forms gathered near the center:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Don't you two pin this on me. I wasn't even involved in that incident in the caldera!}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Wrathion, we must tell the Aspects the news, on behalf of [[Black dragonflight|our flight]].}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Fyrakk has emerged from Zaralek in a blazing trail of destruction! What happened down there?}}

Speak with Ebyssian:
:Thank you for joining us, <name>.
:Are you ready to deliver our report to Alexstrasza?
:{{gossip|I am ready.}}

An in-engine cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|ZnJ-ROtfzic}}
:''Alexstrasza starts the scene in her visage form.''
:{{text|say|Wrathion|The situation is dire, Queen Alexstrasza.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|We pursued Fyrakk to a great cauldron below, a font of [[elemental]] fire.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|He consumed the energies within and emerged -- wreathed in [[shadowflame]].}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Shadowflame... We cannot risk losing you to its corruption.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|The [[Dragonflight|other flights]] will hunt Fyrakk, and work to stop the [[Sundered Flame]].}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|You cannot return to Zaralek.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Respectfully, Life-Binder, it was [[Deathwing]] who fell to that corruption.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I believe that we have the strength to resist what lies below.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|All of you?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|This... is our battle to fight.}}
:''Wrathion and Sabellian nod.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|The world must be shown that the black dragonflight can bear its responsibilities.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|Very well. When you are ready, return to Zaralek.}}
:{{text|say|Alexstrasza the Life-Binder|May the true spirit of the Earth-Warder guide you.}}

On complete, the dragons all return to their usual spots, with the aspects regaining dragon form.

This concludes the "The Ancient Bargain" criterion of [[Embers of Neltharion (achievement)]]. [[Ebyssian]] starts the next quest in the campaign, [[Here We Go Again (quest)]], next week.
