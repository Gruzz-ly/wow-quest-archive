==Objectives==
Carefully excavate the defaced [[dragon]] statue.
*Speak to [[Roska Rocktooth|Roska]] to start the excavation
*[[Defaced Dragon Statue|Statue]] Excavated
*[[Archivist's Earth Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
<This dragon statue is similar to others found in the region but has been covered in paint. 

Googly eyes, stink lines, whiskers, and all manner of other rude drawings decorate the otherwise-imposing stone. The paint looks old and is flaking in places but is not as old as the statue itself. 

Roska will want to have a look at this!>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Nothing like volcanic rock, eh <name>? Never know what you'll find!

==Completion==
I'll tell you what, these [[niffen]] [[bandit]]s had a sense of humor!

==Notes==
On accept, Roska parachutes in:
:{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Whoa! That's quite a find!}}

Speak with her:

{{book|content=Nothing better than standing in the dirt, knowing that just beneath your feet could be a little piece of history.

{{gossip|What can you tell me about this incredible find?}}

Aha, look at that mess of color! These niffen must have been jokesters on top of being bandits.

That dragon statue was probably someone important once upon a time, but by the time the niffen got it, it was just the old jerk who used to own their hideout. 

Sticking it to this stature was probably a way to stick it to all the ghosts they left behind too.

The paint is interesting too. Some folks back at Loamm might want to take a look at it.

{{gossip|quest=|Let's start excavating!}}
}}

If too much lava
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth|There's lava flowing in! Keep it stable!}}

If there's too much earth
:{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|The ground's too hard! We need more lava!}}
:{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Splat that lava! Watch the heat!}}

If the elements are in balance for excavation
:{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|That last rumble hit the sweet spot! Get excavating!}}

Upon excavating the statue, you may examine it for a [[Niffen-Sized Dagger]].
