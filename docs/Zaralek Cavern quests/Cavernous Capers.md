==Objectives==
Travel with [[Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|Rupert]] from the [[Dragonscale Camp]] in the [[Zaralek Cavern]].
* Speak with Rupert to travel to the [[Buried Vault]]

==Description==
While we wait for [[Veritistrasz]] and [[Earthmender Narvra|Narvra]] to nurse the rest of the camp back to health, I thought we might take a short jaunt.

I sensed a cavern on our way here, and... I feel like I may need a bit of spelunking to take my mind off what just happened...

Fancy joining me?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|7|2|25}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
How very rude! 

Why, we turn up, we introduce ourselves politely, and we are attacked!

Ruffians!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Narvra and I will begin healing everyone now that we have an antidote. Go check out the cavern Rupert mentioned. This will take time.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Do you think there could be black dragon artifacts in this cavern?}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|That's the hope. It would be a nice surprise for Tellywin when he wakes up.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Sounds like fun. I will fly and meet you there!}}
:''Voraxian shifts to dragon form and flies away.''
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Voraxian, I could use...}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Sorry! I am too far away and cannot hear you!}}
:{{text|emote|Veritistrasz sighs.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|<Name>, please get him out of whatever trouble he will get himself into.}}

Speak with Rupert again:
:{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready to travel with you.}}
:{{text|whisper|Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|I do apologize for any bumps that may occur; I am not used to passengers on such a trip.}}

On the other side of the loading screen...
:{{text|say|Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|Ah! A watcher! I say my dear fellow, could you assist...}}
:{{text|say|Enraged Watcher|Trespassers shall be purged.}}
:''Voraxian uses his breath attack on the attacking watcher.''
:{{text|say|Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|Oh, Azeroth!}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Well... I did not expect that.}}

Rupert has gossip:
:I am not going to go any further in, if that is okay with you.
:Do you require assistance to return to camp?
:{{gossip|Can you take me back to camp?}}

As does Voraxian:
:I was not expecting watchers. Be careful.
:{{gossip|How did you get in here?}}
:I tunneled.
:I am a black dragon. I may not have all the powers of Neltharion, but a small tunnel is not too difficult to make.
