Location: [[Mysterious Cave]], [[Zaralek Cavern]].

:{{text|say|Myrrit|Wow, look at this place! How fancy. I like statues. Let's go see it up close?}}

Upon approaching the center of the room:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Ooh, are those tablets a clue? This is so exciting!}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Should I trigger one of these buttons on the ground? Which one?}}

The cave is a titanforged style room, at the center two pieces of a [[Deliberately Placed Tablet]] can be found which can be read. First piece:

{{Dialogue|One of our family speaks every word true,

You must find the one, should you seek the way through,

But the rest of us sometimes whisper a lie,

Only darkness will find you, if half-truth you don’t spy,

<Here, the tablet is broken off, and cannot be read.>}}

Second piece:
{{Dialogue|<A large section of this tablet is missing, but the bottom is readable.>

...will call forth the test of might,

Choose that which speaks right.

<At the bottom, someone has scrawled another message.>

Good luck, NOSY NIFFEN!}}

Also in the room one can find four statues: a [[Dragon Statue]], a [[Tauren Statue]], an [[Owl Statue (Sniffenseeking)|Owl Statue]] and a [[Heroic Statue]]. Pressure plates can be found near the statues, upon being stepped on they activate the stautes otherwise targeting the statues gives back:
{{Dialogue|<This statue is quiet and dim. It may need some kind of energy to activate.>}}

Once activated the statues say:
{{dialogue|title=Dragon Statue|<This stone dragon streaked with gold has a runic inscription that lights up.>

The stone statue across from me is as wise, and truthful, as her owl features suggest.

{{gossip|Choose this statue as telling the truth.}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Tauren Statue|<This stone statue of a tauren with a mace has a runic inscription that lights up.>

The heroic, rough stone statue is broken, no longer bound to speak true or eloquently.

{{gossip|Choose this statue as telling the truth.}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Owl Statue|<This broken, wooden statue of an owl has a runic inscription that lights up.>

The tauren statue made of iron who holds the hammer is not the correct choice, if you seek our secrets.

{{gossip|Choose this statue as telling the truth.}}}}

{{dialogue|title=Heroic Statue|<This broken, rough stone statue of an adventurer's feet has a runic inscription that lights up.>

The dragon statue's words can all be trusted.

{{gossip|Choose this statue as telling the truth.}}}}

:{{text|say|Myrrit|Oh no, look out! Aaaaah!}}

Picking the wrong statue summons [[Ghastly Lie]]s which attack the adventurer.

The correct choice is the Tauren Statue. Upon picking it, [[Shade of Skytalon]] appears:
:{{text|say|Shade of Skytalon|You have found the truth. I am bound to protect this treasure. Defeat me if you can!}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Look! A tauren spirit!}}

Upon defeating Skytalon and looting [[Small Key]] from him:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|A key!}}

Upon looting the treasure:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|That puzzle would have stumped Effie and me for hours. Great job!}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|We're a great team--strong and sniff-tastic!}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Let's head back to town.}}
