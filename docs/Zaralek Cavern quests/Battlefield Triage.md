==Objectives==
Collect 5 Vacant Elemental Cores and 1 Zaqali Flame Totem.
* [[Vacant Elemental Core]] (5)
* [[Zaqali Flame Totem]]

==Description==
Our situation is less than ideal, we will have to improvise. I can conduct flame to earth to create magma. [[Shadowflame]] could behave similarly.

The [[Primalists]] are summoning [[earth elemental]]s nearby. If we extract their cores, I can use them to contain the shadowflame infecting [[Sabellian]]'s burn.

The Zaqali's totems should already be attuned to the elements here. It will make the siphoning process much more efficient.

Sabellian will need to come with us. I must keep an eye on him--for his sake.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
We cannot delay. Shadowflame deteriorates both mind and body with insidious haste.

I will do everything I can to halt it.

==Completion==
I can only hope these components will be sufficient for the cleansing ritual.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I--do not believe I can fight in this condition...}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Then do not try. Save your strength, Sabellian.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Fyrakk will pay for this! Mark my words.}}
:''They both join the party.''

Head east back into the [[Zaqali Caldera]]. In this part, plenty of [[Crumbling Scoria]] small earth elementals are ready for their cores to be plucked from their corpses. As Sabellian mentioned, he's not up for combat, but Ebyssian will throw his weight around. The large [[Gargantuan Vessel]] and any [[Zaqali Cindershaper]]s will drop a flame totem eventually.

==Progression==
