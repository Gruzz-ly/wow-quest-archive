==Objectives==
Ride Slick through Snail Markers in Restless Wetlands, Wanderer's Steppe, Upper Frostlands, and Shifting Sands.
* Snail Markers in [[Restless Wetlands]] (5) {{co|78.8|45.7|Waking Shores}}
* Snail Markers in [[Wanderer's Steppe]] (5) {{co|77.4|32.1|Ohn'ahran Plains}}
* Snail Markers in [[Upper Frostlands]] (5) {{co|61.8|31.4|Azure Span}}
* Snail Markers in [[Shifting Sands]] (5) {{co|58.4|80.3|Thaldraszus}}

==Description==
While life in [[Zaralek Cavern|these caverns]] is plenty exciting, Slick has a future in the world above. Namely as your trusty [[mount]].

Which means he needs to prepare for all sorts of environments.

Luckily, the [[Dragon Isles]] has biomes to spare. Why don't you take him for a spin? Give him a taste of what's to come. One lap per location should do the trick.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Glimmerogg Racer]]

==Progress==
I don't do too well above ground, myself. All that sunlight and fresh air just plays havoc on my sinuses.

==Completion==
Here comes Slick, traveler extraordinaire! Mucus seems alright, membranes nice and translucent, no cracks in the shell.

Thanks for taking care of him.

==Notes==
The four locations are:
* [[Restless Wetlands]], [[Waking Shores]], south of [[Wingrest Embassy]]
* [[Wanderer's Steppe]], [[Ohn'ahran Plains]], west of [[Rusza'thar Reach]]
* [[Upper Frostlands]], [[Azure Span]], southwest of [[Rhonin's Shield]]
* [[Shifting Sands]], [[Thaldraszus]], north of the [[Temporal Conflux]]
