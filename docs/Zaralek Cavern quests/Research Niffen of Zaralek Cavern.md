Completing this world quest adds a page to the [[Tome of Archived Isles Research]] at {{co|58.5|36.7|Thaldraszus}} in [[Nirobin]]'s office at [[Algeth'ar Academy]] in [[Thaldraszus]]:

{{book|content=Information acquired from the Gaze of Neltharion, Zaralek Cavern, Dragon Isles, Azeroth:

Scandalous! The data suggests the group of niffen bandits buried a fabulous chest of treasure only for some of their company to dig it up again and bury it elsewhere in secrecy from the others.}}

After completing the world quest a second time, the page is filled in with more information:

{{book|content=

Deplorable! After being buried again in secret, these shady double-crossers were, in fact, double-crossed themselves! A few of their number dug up the chest and relocated it yet again!}}

After completing the world quest a third time, the page is completed:

{{book|content= And then--how exhausting--the double- crossers of the double-crossing group were, yes, double-crossed! And that cycle continued several dozen more times thereafter with the treasure being dug up and relocated each time.

As far as I can tell, its final resting place was ultimately lost by all involved.
