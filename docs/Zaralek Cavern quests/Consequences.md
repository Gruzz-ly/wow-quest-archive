[[File:Take Out the Head - Sabellian.jpg|thumb|upright|Sabellian Shadowflamed]]

==Objectives==
Inspect [[Sabellian]]'s injuries.
* Sabellian's injuries inspected {{co|38.2|48.4|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
[[Shadowflame]]...

Did [[Iridikron]] know this was here? Did he corrupt his brother? Or has [[Fyrakk]] fallen to the temptation?

Only ignorance or arrogance tempts fools to seek it out, believing they can master dark forces that not even [[Neltharion]] could. It infected him, slowly, like gangrenous lesion until finally he succumbed to madness.

So too will Fyrakk.

I will not take that risk with Sabellian. 

He was burned badly before I was able to fly you to safety. Let us assess the extent of the damage.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
I will not lose a single person to shadowflame.

Not Sabellian. Not anyone.

==Completion==
If Fyrakk is absorbing the shadowflame infused in the caldera itself, we will need more strength than just our own to stop him.

But we cannot worry about any of that until Sabellian's wound is cleansed of corruption.

==Notes==
Speak with Sabellian:
:<Sweat beads on Sabellian's temples as he clutches his arm, breathing through his teeth.>
:{{gossip|Let me see your arm.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|He--He caught my arm with shadowflame. It was on his BREATH, Ebyssian! He was consuming-- ARRRG! It burns! It speaks!}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I saw! I know! Let us tend to your wounds, then we can talk about defeating this monster.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|My well-being is of no concern right now! Fyrakk is the only thing you should--}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|You are my brother. I will not trade your life for Fyrakk's, nor for anything.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Arrrrrnnng-- Fine. Only so that I may help you in our coming battle.}}
