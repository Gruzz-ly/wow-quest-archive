==Objectives==
Make Niffen Incense with [[Citros]].
* Add Snail Slime
* Add Bugs
* Add Crystals

==Description==
Well, it's not too often we see uplanders around here!

[[Elder Honeypelt|Honeypelt]] must have a good reason for sending you my way, she doesn't trust just anyone with her incense.

A kith's incense is their pride and joy. Each one smells unique, and we use them to identify each other. 

Making incense is a delicate business. Just head over to that cauldron and [[Marie Shellie]] and I will help ya out with whipping up some replacements.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
It's starting to smell really good!

==Completion==
Not bad for your first go at it! You should go put these down where they belong.

==Notes and trivia==
The great tradition from [[Zul'Drak]] and [[Sholazar Basin]] continues: pick-an-ingredient quests... though thankfully there's no timed portion.

First, Interact with the [[Incense Brew]] to add the Snail Slime from the previous quest. Then add some bugs from the [[Platter of Bugs]], and some crystals from the basket of [[Smelling Crystals]].

The quest title is a reference to the {{wplink|Nirvana}} song "{{wplink|Smells Like Teen Spirit}}".

==Progression==
