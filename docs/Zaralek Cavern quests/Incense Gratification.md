==Objectives==
Place 9 Missing Incense in [[Zaralek Cavern]].
* Incense Placed (9)

==Description==
That's some real potent incense you made! Usually it takes time to get this good!

Now, I've got some of my own brewing to do, so you're gonna have to go out and set those up by yourself.

Once you're finished I'm sure [[Elder Honeypelt|Honeypelt]] will be mighty keen on hearing about it! Best follow up with her when you're done.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* [[Pungent Niffen Incense]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>! I take it [[Citros]] was helpful?

==Notes==
Containers of Niffen Incense on the northwestern road out of [[Loamm]] light up, and are marked on the minimap. Interact with all nine of them.
