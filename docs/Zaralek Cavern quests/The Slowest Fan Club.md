==Objectives==
Collect 8 Aimless Snails.
* [[Aimless Snail]] captured (8)
* [[Snailcatcher Net]] (provided)

==Description==
Has a crowd ever roared for you? Everyone shouting your name, pushing you on to victory?

I want to give that same feeling to [[Slick in the Big City|Slick]]. Give him the taste of being a champion.

Course, we don't speak snail, so we can only be so useful. Round up some snails that could use purpose in their lives. Slick needs a fan club.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Glimmerogg Racer]]

==Progress==
A race track ain't no race track without fans to watch the race. That's just facts.

==Completion==
Perfect! Stick some Big Slick in the City merchandise on these critters and they're ready to go. Our boy's going to be more motivated than ever.

==Notes==
Head north into [[Cascades Column]] and look for Aimless Snail critters. It may help to turn on ESC &rarr; Options &rarr; Interface &rarr; Critters and Companions to help them stick out.

==Progression==
{{Snail Racing}}
