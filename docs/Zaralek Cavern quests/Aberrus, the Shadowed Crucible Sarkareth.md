==Objectives==
Enter [[Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible]], and defeat [[Sarkareth]].
* Slay [[Scalecommander Sarkareth (tactics)|Sarkareth]]
*Speak with [[Ebyssian]] at the Aberrus Approach.

==Description==
I have no interest in following my brothers within Aberrus, but I continue to care for their safety. [[Neltharion]] fell so deeply into madness that his secret stronghold is no doubt filled with any number of unspeakable dangers.

Go with them, <name>. Stand with them. They will need your support in what is to come.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|84|27}}
* 14,300 [[XP]]
* [[Enchanted Wyrm's Shadowflame Crest]]
* [[Dragon Isles Supply Cache]] (250)
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +1,500 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Aberrus holds mysteries and dangers alike. They must be dealt with, before any of them fall into the wrong hands.

==Completion==
I never imagined that Sarkareth would have gone to such lengths to seize power.

Thank you, <name>.

==Notes==
Defeat Sarkareth on any difficulty.

Afterwards, at the [[Aberrus Approach]] by the instance line, check in with Emberthal, Ebyssian, Wrathion, and Sabellian, many of whom have gossip:

;Ebyssian: What have you learned, <name>?
;Sabellian: What is it, <name>?
;Wrathion: Oh, <name>... my apologies. I was preoccupied. Was there something you needed?
