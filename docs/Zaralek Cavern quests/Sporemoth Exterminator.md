==Objectives==
Kill 10 Sporemoths.
* [[Sporemoth]] slain (10)

==Description==
Looks like sporemoths are wrecking these crops.

If they keep eating all the spores, the hermit won't have anything to harvest.

We need to cull the sporemoths. That should help keep the harvest thriving--and show that I know how to take care of a farm.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If we don't keep the pests under control, the spores won't grow.

==Completion==
That should help keep the spores healthy for now.

==Notes==
Defeat [[Hungry Sporemoth|hungry]] and [[Pesky Sporemoth|pesky sporemoths]]. [[Agrul]] will help!

==Progression==
{{Hermit's Hovel}}

==Patch changes==
* {{Patch 10.1.0|note=Added.}}
