==Objectives==
Find [[Agrul]].
* Agrul found

==Description==
I knew I recognized that [[drogbar]]'s voice.

He probably took [[Persii]]. I bet he knows where she is!

Please, <name>, you gotta track down that big bully. Do whatever it takes to get Persii back!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I never should have worked for Malrogg...

==Notes==
Head southeast up the [[Cascades Canyon]] to find Agrul outside a small cave:
:{{text|say|Agrul|Wait! Hear me out!}}
:{{text|say|Agrul|My boss is in that cave. Nasty brul named Malrogg. He made me take the mouse. Said he needed it for snail hunting.}}

Agrul has new gossip:
:I hope it's not too late to make it up to Yarren...

==Progression==
{{Hermit's Hovel}}

==Patch changes==
