'''Stopping Sarkareth''' concludes the fifth chapter of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]], "Inevitable Confrontation". The final chapter, "A Flame, Extinguished", begins two weeks later with [[A Flame, Extinguished]] after defeating Sarkareth in the raid. Additionally, [[Ebyssian]] starts the raid breadcrumb quest: [[Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible: Sarkareth]].

==Objectives==
Defeat the [[Dreadful Defender]] at the [[Aberrus Approach]].
* [[Scalecommander Sarkareth|Sarkareth]] stopped {{co|48.5|15.0|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
This is our last chance, <name>. If we allow Sarkareth to slip in to [[Aberrus]], he may gain power that puts him beyond our reach. We must stop him now!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 11,900 [[XP]]
* [[Drake's Shadowflame Crest]]
* [[Sign of Respect]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Dark Talons]]
* +50 reputation with [[Obsidian Warders]]

==Completion==
He does not care for the [[dracthyr]] loyal to him. He only cares for himself.

<Emberthal sets her jaw.>  

He is lost to us all now.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Emberthal flies over to Sarkareth.''
:{{text|yell|Scalecommander Sarkareth|I need more time!}}

The [[Dreadful Defender]] spawns:
:{{text|say|Dreadful Defender|Initiating aggressive defensive measures.}}

Defeat it, then an in-game cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|w2R_5-cf8sM}}
:''Sarkareth lies prone on the ground before Emberthal and Ebyssian as Wrathion and Ebyssian walk up from the raid.''
:{{text|say|Emberthal|Let it go, Sarkareth. There is no victory beyond that threshold--only ruin.}}
:''Sarkareth shakes his head as Emberthal holds out her hand. Instead of taking it, he swipes and gets to his feet, knocking Ebyssian and Emberthal back.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|No! You will not stop me! Aberrus is mine!}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|I will heed his call!}}
:''Sarkareth leaps into the air and flies into the raid.''
:{{text|say|Emberthal|Then you have made your choice.}}
:''Sabellian is staring Wrathion down.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|We cannot let that zealot take control of the lab.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|What are you looking at me for? Let's go!}}
:''They run off. Ebyssian and Emberthal watch, then Ebyssian turns to look at Emberthal.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|You... will not pursue him?}}
:{{text|say|Emberthal|I know he will face justice but...}}
:{{text|say|Emberthal|He is lost and I grow weary of fighting my own kin. But you...}}
:''Emberthal turns her head to look at Ebyssian. He closes his eyes for a moment, then looks away.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Those two must face this without me. I hope... in their pursuit...}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|They will finally see that Neltharion's legacy is death and nothing more.}}
:''Emberthal turns and takes a few steps toward the console that Sarkareth was using.''
:{{text|say|Emberthal|Then let us find the dracthyr who have not yet succumbed to that fate.}}
:''Ebyssian nods and they both walk to the console.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Lead the way, Emberthal.}}
