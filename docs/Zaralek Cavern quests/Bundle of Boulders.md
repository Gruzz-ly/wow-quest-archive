Hey Uplander!

I heard you've been telling people I've been mean to you.

I haven't, but they told me to be nicer to you because all you've done for us.

Taken advantage of? More like giving you some honest work!

To make you and the others happy, I'll give you some boulders.

See me in Loamm, Ponzo
