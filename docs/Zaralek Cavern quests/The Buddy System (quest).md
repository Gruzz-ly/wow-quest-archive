==Objectives==
Go on a dig adventure with Myrrit.
*Go on a Dig with [[Myrrit]]
*Returned with Myrrit to [[Loamm]]

==Description==
Oh, hello there. Was I speaking my thoughts out loud again?

I don't mean to trouble others with my problems, but...

I'm a sniffenseeker, you see. We find unique and amazing places all over the cavern! But we have an important rule here in Loamm--we always follow the buddy system. Nobody digs alone!

I've had the same buddy since we were pups, but she's too busy to dig anymore. I found this interesting new smell. Before, I had a buddy to go with...

Say, how do you feel about being a stand-in dig

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +125 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

==Progress==
Just let me know if you decide you'd like to go with me!

==Completion==
You're a good partner. We should do more digs together. We could even have a dig team name! Like... the diggies? Duggies? I'll think about it.

I'm not sure when my main dig buddy will have time to go again, so I'm glad to have met you, friend!

==Notes==
;On approach
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|I could go by myself...}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|No, no, that's not a good idea.}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Say, <class>, are you busy?}}

;Upon accept
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Oh, I can't wait! Let me know when you're ready to go.}}

:{{Gossip|quest=|Let's go Sniffenseeking! [Begin first dig]}}

Myrrit takes the adventurer, and they enter a [[Mysterious Cave]]. [[Myrrit's Backpack]] is there.
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Here we are! See why I was nervous to come alone?}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Digs are often full of traps and dangers. We should stay together if we can, new buddy.}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Pick me up and we can get started!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Ready when you are!}}

Interacting with Myrrit's Backpack
:It seems Myrrit has left his backpack here in case you get separated. You find a small toy skunk inside with a nametag that says "Mr. Smelly".
:{{Gossip|Recall Myrrit to the entrance.}}

Click on him.
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|That left passageway smells horrible. I never trust anything that rancid. Let's look at that glowing orb on the right, first!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|If we get separated, let's meet at the start by my backpack, okay?}}

Myrrit has five abilities:
#Burrow
#Sniff
#Put Down Myrrit
#Niffen Friend
#Escape

;Approaching the [[Treasure Chest (Zaralek Cavern)|Treasure Chest]]
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Oooh, there's a treasure chest in there! We'll have to figure something out.}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Wait... I smell something buried nearby.}}

Use Sniff to reveal a piece of ground.
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|I think I smell some metal hidden nearby!}}

Use Burrow, which changes the abilities to:
#Emerge
#Dig

Use Dig.
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|We found a little buried treasure!}}

A [[Smelly Bag]] reveals itself. Loot it for a [[Metal Key]].
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|A key!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|I love keys. But that doesn't help with this shield, does it. The box is inside.}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|There was another passageway. Maybe we could burrow under the fog, and check it out!}}

Going through the gas will make the Choking bar to appear and the character passes out when it's full and resets back.
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Be careful around that poisonous gas. I can burrow under it safely.}}

Burrow through the gas tunnel. On the other side:
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|That was intense--oh, hey! I see a special button. I know how to trigger those!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|My dig buddy always trusts me to disarm the buttons. Stand on it and put me down, okay?}}

Use Put Down Myrrit on the [[Pressure Plate]].

:{{Text|say|Myrrit|The shield opened!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|This is the best part--treasure time! Open the chest!}}

Jump down to the treasure and open it.
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Yay! We did it!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|A perfect sniffenseek!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Pick me up--I can get us out of here in a flash!}}

Myrrit joins you. Use the Escape ability to return back to Loamm.
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|What a great adventure, new buddy!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|I can't wait to do more with you.}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|If you want to go again, just say the word!}}
