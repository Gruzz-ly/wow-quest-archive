*[[Chilled Rune]] {{Profquality|2}} (15)
*Deliver the items to Scridorsa the Chiseler in Loamm

==Description==
The kith of Loamm request the skills of a [[scribe]]! We [[niffen]] have heard of the powerful [[magic]]al writings you produce on the surface, and wish to smell your handiwork with our own noses!

Our Chief Chiseler, Miss Scridorsa, has requested a sample of both pigment and runestone be brought below.

Make a delivery to Loamm as soon as you can, won't you?

==Rewards==

==Progress==
Hmm? Can I help you?

I'm very busy, you know!

==Completion==
What's this? Why are you handing this to me?

...

OH! These are the items I requested from Kayann! Why didn't you say so?

==Notes==
;Upon completion
:{{Text|say|Scridorsa the Chiseler|We've dug up more than one of these "texts" that come from the surface--ink on paper.}}
:{{Text|say|Scridorsa the Chiseler|Paper! Ink! Bah--it's no good to us niffen! Our eyesight is poor. We need texture to feel!}}
:{{Text|say|Scridorsa the Chiseler|I don't know what they were thinking... but I'm going to do something about it!}}
:{{Text|say|Scridorsa the Chiseler|If I combine this empowered rune with this glass, and throw this magic pigment on here...}}
:{{Text|say|Scridorsa the Chiseler|SMELLIFICATION!}}
:{{Text|say|Scridorsa the Chiseler|I call it Scridorsa's Smell-o-vision! The words now each have their own distinct smells!}}
:{{Text|say|Scridorsa the Chiseler|And since I can finally sniff out all these scrolls and tomes, I have much to do! Go on now--and thank you!}}
:{{Text|say|Scridorsa the Chiseler|My goodness, this is quite scandalous! Oh! She did not say that!}}

Completing this quest gives the adventurer the Scridorsa's Smelly Ingenuity buff.
