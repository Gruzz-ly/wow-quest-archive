==Objectives==
Collect 10 Gelcap Spores.
*[[Gelcap Spores]] (10)

==Description==
Ah, Uplander! Can I ask for your assistance?

The cavern below is full of [[mushroom]]s that are useful for all kinds of things! Miss [[Mistie]] has asked for help gathering them for her alchemical experiments.

She says the Gelcap mushrooms produce sticky spores that she can make into a balm, good for easing achy joints and bunions! I sure could use some after standing around on these hard stones all day!

If you can find her some, I'm sure she will make it worth your while!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

{{itembox|You will receive:|Alchemy Notes
}}

==Progress==
Have you collected the spores? I'm eager to get my hands on them!

==Completion==
These are incredibly sticky spores! Thank you, <name>!

Next time you see [[Kayann]], tell him I'll get him his balm soon--and some free sunscreen to boot! I don't know how he stands being up there all day!
