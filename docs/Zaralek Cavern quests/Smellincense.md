'''Smellincense''' is a bonus objective that takes place at {{co|61|54|Zaralek Cavern}} circling [[Deephollow Lake]] counterclockwise east of [[Loamm]] in eastern [[Zaralek Cavern]], announced with a zone-wide emote:
:{{text|emote|Delvert is starting to heat up his smelly pot by Deephollow Lake!}}

==Objectives==
*[[Delvert]]'s [[Incense Pot]] filled
*[[Underlight Moth]] slain

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 3x [[Fragrant Unearthed Coin]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +25 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Delvert|Quickly, friend! This will be my smelliest concoction yet, if you can help me gather ingredients for the pot!}}

[[Delvert]] is riding a cart with [[Beckite]] pulling it that has an Incense Pot on the back. Loot Bellowbeetles, Mellowroots, and Peppercaps, and toss them one-by-one into the pot. Each object thrown is 3-4% progress.

While circling the lake, [[Underlight Moth]]s aggro onto the pot and players who throw anything into it. Fend them off, then get back to filling the bar.
:{{text|say|Delvert|Bah! Those moths know a good a thing when they smell it! Help! Keep them off me!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Delvert|Yes, it's done! Delicious! Thank you, friends!}}
