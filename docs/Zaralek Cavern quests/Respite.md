[[File:Respite.jpg|thumb|A brief respite at [[Dragonscale Camp]]]]

==Objectives==
Join the Dragonscale team in the [[Zaralek Cavern]] for a meal.
* Choose your meal
* Talk to Camp Members (6) (Optional)
* Ask Tellywin about the Artifacts you recovered

==Description==
Thank you for everything you have done for us. 

We've been able to get back on our feet now, and [[Butterfingers]] has cooked up a meal. 

We lost a member of our team and everyone is still a bit shaken... We could do with the morale boost of a good meal.

Would you like to join us?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 14,300 [[XP]]
* 15x [[Flightstones]]
* 5x [[Explorer's Mix]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Thank you, <name>. I think we needed that small break.

==Completion==
Returning these artifacts is the least we can do. And the opportunity to study additional artifacts is tantalizing!

Thank you for helping us, <name>. This opportunity for study will be huge for the [[Dragonscale Expedition]].

==Notes==
[[File:Respite - meal choices.jpg|thumb|Decisions, decisions...]]

On accept:
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|Please, join us for a bite to eat.}}
:{{text|say|Chef Butterfingers|It's not a feast, but it's the best I could rustle up in the short time. Grab whatever you like.}}

The table in front of Butterfingers lights up. Players can choose from [[Peacebloom Tea]], [[Roasted Kabab]], [[Fruit Platter]], [[Cheese Platter]], [[Roasted Nuts]], but not the [[Rock Platter]].

Pick one, then check in with all of the camp members:
;Tellywin Sharpfizzle: <Tellywin looks significantly better than the last time you saw him>
: I guess the good thing about flesh is it is a lot easier to heal with magic than metal is. Someone should probably work on some magic to repair metal.
: That's got to be a thing, right?
: {{gossip|{{text|rare|(Optional)}} Those are impressive swords. Are you the warrior of the group?}}
: No, that was [[Sheridon Hastle|Sheridon]]. He... managed to distract the [[djaradin]] long enough for us to get away. 
: Honestly, I don't even know how to use them, other than stick the pointy end in the other person.
: {{gossip|Why do you have the swords if you don't know how to use them?}}
: Because everything is bigger than me. 
: Take [[wasp]]s, or [[snake]]s or whatever, they've got fangs, stingers, you don't mess with them. 
: Then you have the things that look like wasps and snakes and you think "Oh, that looks bad, going to stay away from that".
: Same thing with the swords, it deters. Although... not enough, apparently.
*{{gossip|I know some people adept with swords, if you would like to learn.}}
*{{Gossip|I could give you a few tips on swords, if you are interested.}}
: No, thanks though. I'm really more a book sort of person.
: That's what drew me to the Dragonscale Expedition. The only thing better than reading about old things is finding old things and figuring out what they are for other people to read about!
: Or at least, I think so. This was my first outing. I haven't actually discovered anything new yet.
: {{gossip|You are in an underground cavern that was [[Neltharion]]'s secret base of operations.}}
: Well, yeah, but there are other people down here as well. It's not that special; it's just a thing that happened. 
: It's not like I did anything to discover the cavern. I just walked in.
: {{gossip|Things rarely feel special to the people they are happening to.}}
: Huh... I hadn't thought of it like that.
: I guess if it wasn't happening to me, I would be interested in reading about it.
: Hmm, these crystals are different from the ones we've seen above ground...
: <Tellywin absentmindedly stops talking and starts furiously writing in his journal.>
* {{gossip|quest=|What were the artifacts we recovered?}}
:{{text|say|Tellywin Sharpfizzle|They are fascinating! The book alone is going to take years to study; it's filled with meticulously kept notes!}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|The final page mentioned something about the [[Gaze of Neltharion]]. What is that?}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|It's what the locals call the big tower in the Sulfur Wastes. It's where we were heading towards when we were attacked. Once we are rested, I mean to move out again.}}
:{{text|say|[[Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental]]|The djaradin were unanticipated. We can circumnavigate the sulfur pits via [[Loamm]] this time.}}
:{{text|say|Tellywin Sharpfizzle|And after we return, we can get these artifacts back to basecamp for study!}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|At the [[Obsidian Citadel]] you mean. These artifacts belong to my flight, and they should be returned to us.}}
:{{text|say|Tellywin Sharpfizzle|Oh... that's not standard protocol...}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|You're right, Voraxian. These artifacts should be returned to your people.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|You have my thanks. I will make sure you have access to the rest of the Citadel's artifacts for study in exchange.}}
:{{text|say|Tellywin Sharpfizzle|Oh my! That is very generous!}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|Our mission to the Gaze of Neltharion may of yield more of your flight's artifacts, Voraxion. Will you be joining us? Veritistrasz?}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|I would like to, yes.}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Yes, I will join you, young ones. If anything to keep from having to patch all of you up again.}}
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|Whatever the reason, I'm glad to have you both onboard.}}
;Earthmender Narvra: We lost Sheridon during the attack, and the team is struggling to get back on their feet. 
: Anything you can do to help build their spirits would be greatly appreciated.
: {{gossip|{{text|rare|(Optional)}} How are you doing?}}
: Oh, I'm doing well. I just want to make sure that the team is doing well. 
: I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
: {{gossip|It's okay to not be okay.}}
: No, I need to hold it together for everyone else. 
: They need a strong leader.
: {{gossip|It takes strength to admit you need help.}}
: I failed my team. It was their first time on a mission. I was the only veteran, and I failed them.
: Sheridon is dead. Everyone else in the team was severely injured. If you and the dragons hadn't turned up when you did, we would all have died.
: I... don't think I should be leading this team.
: {{gossip|I have been saved by others too. There is no shame in needing help.}}
: Hah, you have been saved by others? You are the great <name>! From what I hear you are the one that does the saving. 
: Every story I have heard of you has you defeating the greatest threats to [[Azeroth]] and walking away with your head held high.
* {{gossip|I would have been killed by the [[Lich King]] if not for [[Tirion Fordring|Tiron Fordring]]{{sic}}.}}
* {{gossip|[[Illidan]] and [[Khadgar]] saved me from being blown up on [[Kil'Jaeden]]'s ship.}}
* {{gossip|[[Magni]] and [[MOTHER]] helped me hold off corruption and defeat [[N'zoth]].}}
* {{gossip|Khadgar and [[Kalecgos]] saved me from [[Primal Incarnates|the Incarnates]].}}
* {{gossip|[[Ebyssian]] saved me from [[Fyrakk]].}}
: I... have to admit, I hadn't heard that part of your tales. I guess you only ever hear the victory part. 
: If even you need help sometimes, then maybe it isn't a weakness. Thank you <name>.
;Chef Butterfingers: "It's a promotion," they said. "Be a head chef," they said. 
: They didn't tell me giant fire djaradin were on the menu! Seems like that was relevant information!
: {{gossip|{{text|rare|(Optional)}} How are you doing?}}
: Ya know, I thought the worst thing in my life was playing second fiddle to that giant hunka charcoal in a hat over there. 
: Turns out the worst thing was nearly being murdered by giant fire beasts.
: I guess I have a story to tell my grandkids now that doesn't involve cookin' beans.
: {{gossip|How did you prepare this food so quickly?}}
: I'm a good cook is how! Ok, it's not one of those fancy [[Tuskarr]] feasts I keep hearing people yammer on about, but I didn't have much time, and everyone needed something warm in their belly.
: Sometimes you can make something tasty, and quick, and healthy! Not often mind, and it's not exactly high cuisine, but it'll do in a pinch.
: {{gossip|Have you always enjoyed cooking?}}
: Yeah, I've been cooking since I was a kid, my ma said she could barely get me outta the kitchen.
: I just like to see the looks on peoples faces when they eat good food you know? The difference between a slammed together cheese sandwich, and one made with love is night and day.
: Unless you are like Tellywin, in which case apparently "Food is just food".
: {{gossip|Your food is having a positive effect on everyone, their spirits seem to be lifting.}}
: You noticed that too huh? Nice to see right? 
: You a cook yourself?
: {{gossip|I consider myself a good chef.}}
: Oh that's great! I always love meeting another chef! 
: Maybe next time we can cook a meal together?
;Veritistrasz: I did not expect to run into you down here <name>, but I am very glad I did. You saved these people, as you saved me. 
: I was not in a good place when we first met in the [[Ruby Lifeshrine]], but you sat and listened, and that helped. 
: More than you could ever know.
: {{gossip|{{text|rare|(Optional)}} How are you doing?}}
: I am doing... well? 
: It sounds surprising to say it after so many years, but I am honestly doing well.
: It feels good to be helping people once again, although I do wish it were under better circumstances.
: {{gossip|What brought you here?}}
: After you introduced me to Voraxian, we have been spending a lot of time together trading stories and talking about what we want to accomplish. We both want to see the [[black dragonflight]] grow and flourish.
: When these caverns opened, we both decided to come and help.
* {{gossip|Do you have any other plans here?}}
:: Voraxian wanted to come down here to find stories about the obsidian flight of old. 
:: He hopes they are positive ones. I fear they won't be, but I am here to support him.
:* {{gossip|I'm glad you are doing well.}}
:: In no small part due to you. You helped when I needed it. 
:: You listened at the Lifeshrine when I needed to talk, and you did not judge. You introduced Voraxian, and helped give me the push I needed to start helping out the black dragonflight.
:: I do not think I can adequately thank you for all you have done for me.
:: <Veritistrasz smiles softly.>
:: Maybe one day.
:* {{gossip|<Smile sadly in understanding, nod, and turn to talk to another member of camp.>}}
* {{gossip|I'm glad you and Voraxian are getting along.}}
:: Ah, do not tell him, but I am starting to become fond of him. 
:: In many ways he reminds me of Distyia. She also wanted to explore the past, learn from it, and bring those lessons forward to a new time.
:: He wanted to come down here to hear stories from the local inhabitants about the obsidian flight of old. 
:: He hopes they are positive ones. I fear they won't be, but I am here to support him.
:* {{gossip|I'm glad you are doing well.}}
:: In no small part due to you. You helped when I needed it. 
:: You listened at the Lifeshrine when I needed to talk, and you did not judge. You introduced Voraxian, and helped give me the push I needed to start helping out the black dragonflight.
:: I do not think I can adequately thank you for all you have done for me.
:: <Veritistrasz smiles softly.>
:: Maybe one day.
:* {{gossip|<Smile sadly in understanding, nod, and turn to talk to another member of camp.>}}
Veritistrasz has a [[carving of Distyia]] at his feet...

;Voraxian: <Name>, I knew you were good at raiding vaults, but that was an impressive display earlier!
: {{gossip|{{text|rare|(Optional)}} How are you doing?}}
: Fantastically! It feels good to be on an adventure, it feels good to have helped these people, and it feels good to meet a friend again. 
: That is three feels good. I would be ungrateful to ask for more than that.
: {{gossip|How have things have been with you and Veritistrasz?}}
: Good, he is doing a lot better than when we first met. 
: I think the sense of purpose is helping him. That is why I want to introduce him to the rest of my flight.
: {{gossip|Did you come down here looking for more artifacts?}}
: Yes and no. I had hoped to learn more about my flight's history from before the corruption. 
: Then we found the buried vault and now there are artifacts too. 
: A very happy surprise!
* {{gossip|I'm happy to help you learn about your flight's history. It's unlikely to be positive though.}}
:: Certainly not with that attitude, <name>! 
:: I jest, I jest.
:: This cavern was from before the black dragons fell to corruption. So even if there were some bad apples, there must have been some good as well?
* {{gossip|I'm happy to help you learn about your flight's history.}}
:Thank you! I look forward to us working together again. It is always a pleasure!
* {{gossip|<Nod and turn to talk to another camp member.>}}
;Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental: Well. That was certainly quite the adventure. I have to say enraged Titan watchers was not exactly what I was expecting I would have to deal with today.
: Between that and the djaradin, it has certainly been a very... engaging day.
: {{gossip|{{text|rare|(Optional)}} How are you doing?}}
: Ah, well. I do have a stiff upper lip, but I have to admit, I am quite shaken.
: I had only recently met Sheridon, but he seemed like a nice person. And he was taken from us with such brutality. 
: Then we had those uncouth watchers, which I was not expecting at all. 
: It has been a day.
: {{gossip|Why are you so different from other earth elementals?}}
: I am not sure I understand the question. 
: You are different from others of your race, are you not?
* {{gossip|I'm not that different.}}
:: <Name>, we have been climbing together. I have seen you launch yourself off the side of a cliff in a very nontraditional climbing manner and catch a rock with seemingly no care in the world. You are far from a normal example of a <race>.
:: {{gossip|I meant that most earth elementals on the isles have been aggressive so far.}}
:: Well, you might find yourself a tad aggressive if the land you were bound to was [[Cataclysm (event)|torn asunder]] by an [[Deathwing|insane Earth-Warder]].
:: Then, as you started to recover, you were stabbed with a [[Sword of Sargeras|giant Titan sword]].
:: Then, as you started to recover yet again, you had your very essence nearly sucked into the [[Shadowlands|realms of Death]].
:: It has been quite the two decades is all I am saying.
:: {{gossip|Why are you helping the [[Dragonscale Expedition]]?}}
:: I prefer to rely on diplomacy where possible.
:: It seems to me that most mortals are trying to help Azeroth. Holding the many accountable for the actions of the few rarely gets you anything except hate and violence. 
:: I prefer to try to bring us together rather than push us apart. That is much easier to do from the inside, as it were.
::* {{gossip|I am glad you are with the team.}}
::: Thank you. That does mean a lot to me. 
::: Gosh, now I am blushing.
::: <Rupert turns away from you and tries to hide his head.>
::* {{gossip|<Nod and talk to someone else.>}}
* {{gossip|I suppose I am.}}
:Exactly: our climbing adventures alone would be enough for me to know that you are an uncommonly brave person with the way you propel yourself from one rock to another with no care in the world.

:I am terrified of heights. I do not know how you do it.

:{{Gossip|I meant that most earth elementals on the isles have been aggressive so far.}}

Sharpbeak also has gossip:
: Squawk?
