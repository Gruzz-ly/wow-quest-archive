==Objectives==
Observe the Scene from the past.
*Nexus Point reached
*Put on the Goggles
*Observation Mode activated
*Temporal Scene observed
*[[Technoscryers]] (provided)

==Description==
[[Tuskarr]] artifacts, underground, deep in [[Djaradin]] territory?

If we didn't find it ourselves I wouldn't believe it. What do you think they were doing down here?

Ok looks like the nexus point is right here in this cave. Let's get to the bottom of this!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Azerothian Archives]]

==Progress==
I wonder what we'll find?

==Completion==
Tuskarr and Djaradin trading? I wonder how long that lasted.

==Notes==
On activating observation mode:
:{{text|say|Tuskarr Merchant|Greetings, honorable Djaradin.}}
:{{text|say|Zaqali Quartermaster|Tuskarr. What do you bring to trade?}}
:{{text|say|Tuskarr Merchant|Oh, only a selection of the finest fish caught in our very rivers!}}
:{{text|say|Tuskarr Merchant|And in return, the harpoons which have proven so effective against the [[dragon]]s above.}}
:{{text|say|Zaqali Quartermaster|...These fish will not be enough.}}
:{{text|say|Tuskarr Merchant|How perceptive! These are just a sample. We guarantee enough fish to make your belly as full as mine, if you wish.}}

==Progression==
