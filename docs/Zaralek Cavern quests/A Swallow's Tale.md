'''A Swallow's Tale''' begins the optional "A Swallow's Tale" storyline of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]].

==Objectives==
Speak with Swallows Keeper [[Nevroll]] in [[Zaralek Cavern]].
*Speak with Nevroll {{co|55.7|60.2|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
Uplander!

I'm [[Effervesta]], Lady Redolence to the [[niffen]] of [[Loamm]]--the daughter of [[Aurantia|their leader]]. No need for formalities though, you can just call me Effie!

Keep this between you and me, but we're a bit behind on some shipments to [[Glimmerogg]], and the [[Drogbar]] are definitely not happy one bit! You've already been so helpful to [[Elder Honeypelt]]... maybe you can give me a hand too?

Our swallows keeper, Nevroll, might be able to dig up some dirt on the issue. 

Will you go talk to him, please?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Really? You'll help?

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Cinnam|Oh this is NOT good! Aurantia is going to be FURIOUS!}}

Speak with Cinnam:
:I do my best to help Nevroll with taking care of the swallows!
:{{gossip|quest=|Do you know where Nevroll is?}}
:I have no idea where he is!
:He wasn't here this morning when I got here, and neither were the swallows!
:I have no idea what I'm going to do... Nevroll can be scary when he's angry.
:I have to get them back!
:{{gossip|What can I do to help?}}
:''Opens the completion pane of Cinnam's gossip window.''
