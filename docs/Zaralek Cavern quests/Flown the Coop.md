==Objectives==
Find 6 [[Frightened Swallow|Lost Swallows]] in [[Zaralek Cavern]].
*Swallows found (6)

==Description==
They're gone! Just... gone!

The swallows, [[Nevroll]], all of it!

And now you say that [[Effervesta]] told you that we're behind on our shipment of swallow nests to the [[Drogbar]]?

This is really bad, Uplander. 

If you want to help, you can start by bringing back as many birds as you can find.

I'll see if I can scrape together any useable nests for the Drogbar in the meantime.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
If Nevroll or the Drogbar show up before we find those birds, we're toast!

==Completion==
Oh, I'm so glad you were able to find some of them!

==Notes==
Look for [[Frightened Swallow]]s in [[Loamm]].

While working on this quest, look for a [[Dead Cave Swallow]] under the bridge, which starts [[A Bitter Pill to Swallow]].

==Progression==
{{A Swallow's Tale}}
