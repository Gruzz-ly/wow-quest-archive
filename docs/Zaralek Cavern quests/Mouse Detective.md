'''Mouse Detective''' begins an un-breadcrumbed optional storyline of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]] at [[Hermit's Hovel]] in south-central [[Zaralek Cavern]].

==Objectives==
Search for the missing mouse.
* Tracks followed {{co|50.4|76.4|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Speak to Argul{{sic}}

==Description==
Normally I'd chase strangers off my property, but today's an exception.

My sniffin' mouse has gone missing. It's not like Persii to ignore me when I call for her...

I can't smell as good as other niffen, so I can't tend to the harvest without her help.

Poor thing must be so scared, out there all on her own. Please, you gotta find Persii!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 47,600 [[XP]]

==Progress==
What? What do you want?

==Completion==
That niffen needs his mouse, huh? Hmm...

==Notes==
Follow the tracks south across the [[Fanged Pasture]] to eventually reach [[Agrul]]:
:{{text|say|Agrul|What? What are you looking for?}}

Speak with the drogbar:
:This farm's nice, huh? Quiet. Calm.
:{{gossip|quest=|<Ask Agrul if he's seen the mouse.>}}
:{{text|say|Agrul|The hermit's sniffin' mouse? She probably wandered off,  or... uh...}}
:{{text|say|Agrul|Anyway, she's gone now. Nothing we can do about that.}}

==Progression==
{{Hermit's Hovel}}
