:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Where did you go? I'm coming to find you!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|That was scary. I'm sorry we got separated, I had to hide from a big worm!}}

Myrrit can sniff out a [[Treasurewhiskers]], that drops [[Deepflayer Claw]] starting [[Deep Cuts]].
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Oh! Stop everything! What's this special scent...?}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|It's a treasurewhiskers! They steal all sorts of things from us!}}

Sniff around and kill three [[Crystal Wormling]]s and [[Diganthor]] appears.
Myrrit|Phew, that's worm-stink!

Kill Diganthor to loot the [[Spit-covered Key]]. Then proceed to the central area and have Myrrit sniff and dig out the Treasure Chest.

:{{Text|say|Myrrit|It was nice to chase a monster, instead of it chasing US!}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Let's head back to town.}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|We got the goodies, right? Pick me up when you're ready to go!}}

A 15-minute debuff Impending Collapse is also obtained...
