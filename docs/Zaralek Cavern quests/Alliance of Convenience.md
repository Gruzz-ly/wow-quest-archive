[[File:Alliance of Convenience.jpg|thumb|Zaqali djaradin and Primalists]]

==Objectives==
Kill 4 Zaqali [[djaradin]] guarding [[Igira]]'s shrine.
* [[Zaqali]] guards slain (4)

==Description==
The [[Primalists]] have a sizeable force of djaradin guarding them while they complete their work.

Even in small numbers, djaradin prove to be formidable opponents when allowed to engage in battle on their own terms. It is far better to bring the fight to them, leaving as little time to react as possible.

Take them out. We cannot have them encroaching on the space we have managed to carve out thus far.

==Rewards==
You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
*[[Endowed Wrap]]
*[[Inherited Cloak]]
*[[Bequeathed Drape]]
*[[Bestowed Cape]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I am certain there will be no lack of djaradin this close to the elders' shrines.

==Completion==
Good. We will need to keep this area clear for now.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Ebyssian and Sabellian join the party.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Sabellian, how is your pain?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I am still injured, but the [[shadowflame]]... It is gone. I no longer feel it creeping towards my soul.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|We acted quickly enough then. You are cleansed.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I feared the worst. I feared I would end up like [[Deathwing|him]].}}

Players again have the Protection of the Ebon Flight buff while on these quests:
:{{Abilities|Protection of the Ebon Flight|Health increased by 200%. Damage taken reduced by 80%. Immune to knockback effects. Regenerating 2% health every 3 sec.|id=403726|icon=inv_icon_wing08e}}

For an easter egg, consider emoting <code>/rude</code> at [[Fyrakk]]:
:{{text|whisper|Fyrakk|HAHAHA!!}}
:{{Abilities|Roasted|Fyrakk is amused by your actions.|id=401533|icon=inv_fyrakk_dragonbreath|notes=Hits for 50% of max health and causes a 10-second debuff: Burning for 2 Shadowflame damage every 2 sec. Healing taken reduced by 100%.}}

Kill a path up the hill to the west-northwest to find the extracted elemental cores for the other quest. This quest is specifically looking for Zaqali djaradin, so the core hounds and Primalists in camp do not count.

==Progression==
{{The Ancient Bargain}}
