==Objectives==
Speak with [[Roska Rocktooth|Roska]] to start the dig, then excavate artifacts from around the [[Gaze of Neltharion|tower]].
*Tell Roska to start the dig
*Finds Unearthed (2)
*Major Find Unearthed
*[[Archivist's Earth Totem]] (provided)

==Description==
Get a load of those rock formations! Surveying doesn't get much better than this. 

This tower has been here for ages. The [[Black dragonflight|black dragonflight]] used it for some seriously dark stuff, but that's not why we're here. After the dragons left, a troupe of [[Niffen|niffen]] bandits took shelter in the ruins and robbed the place blind. But they left a bunch of trash everywhere. 

Imagine what we could learn about the niffen from that trash once we get digging!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{Cost |28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Nothing like volcanic rock, eh <name>? Never know what you'll find!

==Completion==
<Roska lets out an uproarious bout of laughter.>

Oh, now that one's got to have some kind of crazy story behind it!

==Notes==
On accept, after receiving [[Archivist's Earth Totem]] which summons [[Helpful Earth]]:
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth| This strapping, stony lad should help you shake finds out of the rubble.}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth| Let me know when you're ready to get digging!}}
Tell Roska to start the dig:
{{book|content={{gossip|quest=|I'm ready to start digging!}}}}
:''Roska summons her earth totem and causes a minor earthquake.''
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth| Let's give this place a little rumble and see what shakes out, eh?}}
:{{text|say|Roska Rocktooth| That ought to do it. Try and stay cool with all that lava around!}}

Upon discovering a find, [[Antique Niffen Salvage]], Roska will yell one of the following lines
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|That's one for the thesis!}}
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|That's a find if ever I've seen one!}}
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Would you look at that!}}

Upon unearthing the finds, you may discover [[Tattered Wanted Poster]] and [[Sharpened Shalewing Bones]]

Upon unearthing [[Ruptured Magma]]
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Protect the artifacts!}}
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|That's no find!

Upon finding a rock, you get [[Just a Rock]]
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|Nothing to do but keep digging!}}

Once you've unearthed both finds, an earthquake occurs
*{{text|yell|Roska Rocktooth|This one's gonna be a real treat, I can feel it!}}

Once the [[Defaced Dragon Statue]] is discovered, Roska has new gossip:
{{book|content=
{{gossip|What can you tell me about this incredible find?}}

﻿﻿Aha, look at that mess of color! These niffen must have been jokesters on top of being bandits.

That dragon statue was probably someone important once upon a time, but by the time the niffen got it, it was just the old jerk who used to own their hideout.

Sticking it to this stature was probably a way to stick it to all the ghosts they left behind too.

The paint is interesting too. Some folks back at Loamm might want to take a look at it.
