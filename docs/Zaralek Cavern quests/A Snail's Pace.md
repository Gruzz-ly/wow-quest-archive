==Objectives==
Collect 12 Lap Markers by doing two laps around the [[snail]] track.
*Conch Whistle used (Optional)
*Lap Markers passed (12)

==Description==
It's an off day for our local racing track, so I figured we could take the opportunity to build up Slick's speed. Grow some confidence on his home turf, I'm thinking.

Take two laps around the track. Let's see how your training is coming along!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Glimmerogg Racer]]

==Progress==
Not every day needs to be at a hundred, you know? Even in the fast-paced world of snail racing.

==Completion==
Look at you two, tighter than mucus brothers. Oh, that's what I call it when two snails get stuck to each other. Happens.

You're both coming along just fine. Can't wait to see where you go!

==Notes==
Use the [[Conch Whistle]] to summon [[Big Slick in the City]], then take two laps around the track.

==Progression==
