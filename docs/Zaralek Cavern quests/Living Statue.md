:{{text|say|Myrrit|Wow, look at this place! How fancy. I like statues. Let's go see it up close?}}

This mysterious cave is a titanforged room with two [[Disturbed Protector]]s patrolling around a female [[titan watcher]]. Four empty pedestals surround the statue which can be filled by orbs found around the room.

When Myrrit snuffs out an orb underground:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|I smell something... oh, what's the way to describe this... spicy!}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|We found a little buried treasure!}}

When the first orb is placed:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|It's so glowy.}}

When the second orb is placed:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|I wonder what will happen?}}

When the third orb is placed:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|A perfect fit!}}

When the fourth orb is placed:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|What do we do? Touch the statue? I'm nervous, <name>!}}

Upon activating the statue:
:{{text|say|[[Empowered Protector Lynaera]]|You meddle with what you know naught.}}
:{{text|say|Empowered Protector Lynaera|Come, reveal your might!}}

Upon defeating Lynaera, looting the [[Heated Titan Key]] from her, and opening the nearby chest with it:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|I was afraid that we'd die in here when that scary thing appeared, but you smushed that guardian. Good work!}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|We're a great team--strong and sniff-tastic!}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|That was amazing. Let's head back with our treasure!}}
