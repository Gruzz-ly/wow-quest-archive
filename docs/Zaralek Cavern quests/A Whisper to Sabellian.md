==Objectives==
Speak to [[Sabellian]] at the [[Obsidian Spire Outpost|Djaradin Assault]].
* Speak to Sabellian {{co|46.7|29.6|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
Our assault on [[Brimstone Garrison]] will not work without Sabellian and his relentless and mighty [[Black dragon|dragons]]. We must convince him that our objectives are aligned.

If we appeal to him as a tactician and [[General (rank)|general]], I'm sure he will help us... I hope.

We will find him with his troops at the [[Djaradin]] Assault.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 4,750 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]
* +500 reputation with [[Sabellian (faction)|Sabellian]]

==Progress==
I believe Sabellian will listen to reason.

==Completion==
Perhaps we will be able to fight as one.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I believe in [[Black dragonflight|my flight]]. They will unite for a good cause.}}
:''Ebyssian shifts back to his dragon form and flies away.''

[[Sabellian]] is at the [[Obsidian Spire Outpost]] just south of the bridge alongside [[Field Commander Ignax]] and [[Exadria]]. Speak with him:
:In such a dangerous place, I must keep my eyes open... and stay focused on what needs to be done.
:{{gossip|quest=|Ebyssian would like to speak to you.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Should I expect a lecture?}}
:''Ebyssian flies in and shifts to his visage form.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Far from it.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|We have all been avoiding [[Aberrus]], but the time has come. Lend me your strength, Sabellian. Emberthal needs to break through the Brimstone Garrison. We can do it if we work together.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Aberrus. You believe Emberthal is worth the blood of my dragons?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|It is no secret that you seek to unravel the legacy of the Earth-Warder hidden within Aberrus. If you must break through the defenses surrounding it, why not now, side by side with allies?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|... Very well. We will be there.}}

==Progression==
{{Inevitable Confrontation}}
