==Objectives==
Find [[Sarkareth]].
* Sundered Flame sentries defeated

==Description==
Did [[Neltharion]] keep this place as his hoard? No wonder that Sarkareth was looking for it. 

Neltharion's "treasures" litter every corner of it.

There's no telling what Sarkareth has gotten his claws on here.

Stay close!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I did not wish to fight Dezran. Sarkareth's strong personality and manipulative tongue are making his people follow his wildest whims.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Three dracthyr appear.''
:{{text|say|Winglord Dezran|Hey! How did you get in?}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Dezran? Stop! I do no wish to fight you!}}
:{{text|say|Winglord Dezran|I have my orders, Emberthal. I cannot let you pass.}}
:''Dezran attacks!''
:{{text|say|Winglord Dezran|Go! Tell Sarkareth we've been breached!}}
:{{text|say|Marithos|Yes, sir!}}
:{{text|say|Amythora|But... what about you, Winglord?}}
:{{text|say|Marithos|That was an order, Amythora! Come on!}}
:{{text|say|Amythora|Of... of course. For the Sundered Flame!}}
:''Amythora and Marithos run further inside.''

Get Dezran to 20% and he becomes unattackable:
:{{text|say|Winglord Dezran|Well? What are you waiting for? End it! Strike me down!}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|No. No more deaths.}}
:''Emberthal walks further into the vault.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I came here to stop Sarkareth and bring him to justice--not to kill more of us.}}

==Progression==
{{Sundered Legacy}}
