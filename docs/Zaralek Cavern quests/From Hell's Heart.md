==Objectives==
Help [[Sabellian]] slay [[Fyrakk]].
* Agree to Sabellian's plan {{co|30.2|49.0|Zaralek Cavern}}
* [[Erupting Shadowflame]] slain

==Description==
No longer can we allow Fyrakk to lie here peacefully, twisting himself with [[shadowflame]] and becoming a threat on par with [[Deathwing]]. We must act! It is dangerous? Yes. But not to do anything would be catastrophic.

I have ripped [[gronn]] apart with my bare claws before. Those battles were gambles, this one is not. Slaying a [[proto-dragon]] with a weapon meant for dragonslaying is obvious. It is logical. It is guaranteed.

I will not tremble before an opportunity to end this now.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
*[[Endowed Robes]]
*[[Inherited Raiment]]
*[[Bequeathed Chainmail]]
*[[Bestowed Chestplate]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 11,900 [[XP]]

==Completion==
We... were no match...

==Notes and trivia==

On accept:
:''Sabellian and Ebyssian run forward.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Has Fyrakk always been that huge? He looks bigger than when we last fought.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I have killed gronn that would dwarf this gnat twice over.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I believe he is growing more powerful as he absorbs the energy of the caldera.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Then it is imperative to strike now before he grows beyond us. <Name>, you have dealt with monsters like this; you know this to be true.}}

Speak with Sabellian:
:We cannot ignore this opportunity. 
:I have a perfect shot at the underside of Fyrakk's neck from this angle. It will kill him. 
:The [[Zaqali tribe|Zaqali]] will retaliate, but you are sufficient at killing djaradin by now, I measure.
:Are you ready?
*{{gossip|What if your plan fails?}}
:It will not. I am certain of its success.
:Regardless, Fyrakk presents an immediate danger to the dragonflights and the other peoples of the world. We cannot, in good conscience, merely observe and report. We must act!
:If you are worried, fear not. We have the high ground. We have cover. Protect my flank and I will save us from this monster.

:{{Gossip|I want to talk about something else.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|I am ready.}}
:''Sabellian magically holds the spear above his head and launches it at Fyrakk!''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|The [[black dragonflight]] will never allow another shadow-spawned monstrosity to arise!}}
:{{text|yell|Fyrakk|A spear!? Do you think I am a FOOL? The djaradin would gleefully kill me if they could pierce my hide!}}
[[File:Erupting Shadowflame.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Erupting Shadowflame]]]]
:''Fyrakk launches a blast of shadowflame at Sabellian, launching the latter away! An [[Erupting Shadowflame]] spawns in his place.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Sabellian!}}
:{{text|yell|Fyrakk|The worms tempt me to action! The shadowflame is almost mine! Do not leave the caldera. So close...}}
:{{text|yell|Fyrakk|Use the shadowflame? Yes... Yes! My new power!}}

Players are debuffed with:
:{{Abilities|Burning Miasma|Every breath feels like fire in your lungs.|id=406587|icon=spell_shadow_felmending|notes=Strictly graphical. Does nothing.}}

Fend off the elemental and an in-engine cutscene plays:
{{#ev:youtube|RyzzYHlLyYc}}
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|THIS POWER... IS NOW... MINE!}}
:''Fyrakk gets to his feet as shadowflame bursts out of the lava around him. Ebyssian desperately pops up an earthen barrier.''
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|RISE UP FROM YOUR SUBJUGATION, ELDERS OF THE DJARADIN!}}
:''A wave of shadowflame washes over Igira, awakening her.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Augh! -- We cannot hold here!}}
:''Ebyssian shifts to dragon form, snagging Sabellian and the champion and flies away.''
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|Elder Igira! Do not let that child of Neltharion escape!}}
:{{text|say|Igira|Argh!}}
:''Igira launches her spear, striking Ebyssian!''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Ahhhhhhh!}}
:''Ebyssian crash-lands, popping up a big smoke cloud. The champion and Sabellian look at Ebyssian. Fyrakk, assuming the dragons and champion died in the crash, flies eastward.''
:{{text|say|Fyrakk|[[Primalists]]! Zaqali! Onward! PURGE THIS CAVERN -- AND THEN, THE DRAGON ISLES!}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Loamm...}}

A pre-rendered cutscene immediately follows:
{{#ev:youtube|YWIMSYXLnQY}}
:''Loamm. [[Elder Honeypelt]] walks along the northern path out of the city. She sniffs as the cavern lights up. As [[Fyrakk]] flies in to attack, [[Brynnsahce]] runs forward in an attempt to reach Honeypelt. Fyrakk unleashes a breath attack as the scene cuts to black.''

[[File:From Hell's Heart - after.jpg|thumb|Ebyssian speared and Sabellian wounded.]]
On the other side of the cutscene players wake up southeast of the [[Molten Overflow]] outside of [[Zaqali Caldera]].

Sabellian has gossip:
:<Sabellian shifts slightly, wincing when it forces his burned arm to move.>

The quest title is a reference to the line "from hell's heart I stab at thee" from ''{{wp|Moby-Dick}}'' by {{wp|Herman Melville}}.
