==Objectives==
Defeat the Brimstone forces loyal to [[Neltharion]] in the [[Brimstone Garrison]].
* Defeat enemies in Brimstone Garrison (0/100%)

==Description==
Do you know what I see when I gaze upon the Brimstone Garrison?

Traitors.

These soldiers believe themselves followers of the [[black dragonflight]], yet they ignore us the true heirs to Neltharion and bend a knee to the specter of our malevolent father. 

This cannot be allowed to stand. 

Show them the error of their ways.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* [[Whelpling's Shadowflame Crest]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
I know that I rule with an iron claw... but it is only because I see what must be done to preserve our people.

==Completion==
It is a shame that these warriors swear allegiance to the wrong cause. They could have been fine allies, but their misguided allegiance doomed them.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|The true black dragonflight are the rightful owners of those weapons!}}
:''Those capable shift to their dragon forms and fly away. The rest run up the bridge.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I will find another way to [[Sarkareth]] while you push your attack here. We shall meet ahead and face him together.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Thank you, <name>. I will never forget your kindness in my time of need.}}
:''Emberthal flies away.''

Push in and get to killing, but don't focus on murder to the detriment of the other quests.

Complete the objectives of this and the other quests, then find [[Wrathion]], [[Ebyssian]], and [[Sabellian]] atop a building in the northern part of the garrison.

On complete, Sabellian has new gossip:
:Wrathion is transparent and easy to unbalance which makes him a predictable opponent.
:My read of Ebyssian is that he wants to serve the black dragonflight... but that his altruism is true is hard for me to believe.
