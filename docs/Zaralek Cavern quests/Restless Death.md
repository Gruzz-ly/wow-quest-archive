==Objectives==
Place anchor totems in the [[Acidbite Ravine]] to allow [[Earthmender Narvra|Narvra]] to start a cleansing ritual.
* Place the first Ritual Anchor Totem {{co|50.4|44.0|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Place the second Ritual Anchor Totem {{co|50.2|41.2|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Place the third Ritual Anchor Totem
* Place the fourth Ritual Anchor Totem

==Description==
What could lead someone to do this... 

I can perform a ritual that might aid these poor creatures passing on. Take these totems and place them along the river. With enough anchor points, I should be able to help them move on.

We'll move ahead to look for a ritual site.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you placed the anchor totems?

==Completion==
Thank you, <name>. Give me a moment. We will begin the ritual shortly. 

Let us hope we can bring rest to these souls.

==Notes==
Pick up all three quests before heading out. Voraxian provides a buff:
:{{Abilities|Voraxian's Enveloping Scales|Voraxian has empowered you with the strength of his flight. Armor is increased by 1,000. Maximum Health is increased by 50%.|id=411801|icon=ability_monk_dragonkick}}

Get to killing, capturing evidence, and totem placing.

Ghost Ritual Anchor Totems are along the lava river in [[Acidbite Ravine]], also marked on the minimap. A [[ghost]] of [[Lead Researcher Sytorian]] says something after each placement:
#{{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|What are you doing? You cannot undo my work!}}<br> {{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|[[Azeroth]] must be ready for any threat the [[Great Dark Beyond|cosmos]] throws at us!}}
#{{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|My work was for the good of all!}}<br> {{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|The things I did so you could sleep comfortably at night...}}
#{{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|I may have failed [[Neltharion]] in life once...}}<br> {{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|But I will not fail him in death! Azeroth must be kept safe!}}
#{{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|You... you do not have the strength to do what must be done.}}<br> {{text|say|Lead Researcher Sytorian|To make the decisions that have to be made... to dirty your claws so that others may keep theirs clean!}}<br> {{text|say|Voraxian|If you are the example of [[Black dragonflight|my flight]]'s past, I am glad to not meet your standards!}}

Head north along the river to turn in.

On return:
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|Ok, everyone! Take your places. We should start this ritual as soon as we can.}}
