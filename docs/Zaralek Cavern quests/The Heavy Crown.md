==Objectives==
Help create a time for [[Myrrit]] to talk to [[Effervesta]].
* Talk to Effervesta {{co|54.6|54.9|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Sat on the "Throne" while perfumed
* Problem Solved

==Description==
I was really down when didn't come like she said she would.

But I understand that she's so busy, what with being kidnapped and all of her duties. I don't blame her.

I want to tell her how much that time meant to me when we were pups, though. That I'll be here for her if she ever needs me. Then at least she knows I'm still here.

Can you help me get her attention long enough to say what I need to?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +125 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

==Progress==
I don't want to bother her...

==Completion==
Now that I have her here, I don't know what to say!

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Let's go see her together this time!}}
:''Myrrit runs off, then stops at the end of the line.''
:{{text|say|Myrrit|I'll just get in line here. Maybe she'll get to me...}}

The same crowd is still pestering Effervesta. Speak with her:
:I'm very busy. Can you be quick?
*{{gossip|quest=|Myrrit really needs to speak with you. He's here. Can you see him?}}
*{{gossip|Why didn't you meet Myrrit at the secret spot?}}
:Oh no! I did miss that, didn't I. It completely slipped my mind!
:I didn't mean to. There's just so much going on here that I lost track. 
:He wasn't waiting too long, was he?
:{{gossip|quest=|Myrrit really needs to speak with you. He's here. Can you see him?}}
:I need to apologize to Myrrit, but I can't get any time away from all of this.
:Wait, I have an idea. Would you stand in for me? All I need to do is spray you with my royal perfume--they won't know the difference!
:Um... and make a quick diversion, of course. Are you ready?
*{{gossip|quest=|Spray away!}}
*{{gossip|quest=|Umm....}}
:{{Text|yell|Effervesta|BEHOLD! My newest royal perfume!}}
:''Effervesta sets off a smoke bomb.''
:{{text|say|Pestering Niffen|It's so pungent!}}
:{{text|say|Pestering Niffen|Eek!}}
:{{text|say|Effervesta|All you need to do now is sit on the chair and help them out for a minute. Stall for me, okay?}}
:''She stealths away to meet Myrrit just to the north.''
:{{text|say|Pestering Niffen|Truly eye-watering.}}
:{{text|say|Pestering Niffen|Wow, so strong.}}
:{{text|say|Pestering Niffen|I can taste it! So inspiring!}}

Hop on the [[Cushion of Questions]] and [[Marron Glassee]] steps forward:
:{{text|say|Marron Glassee|Lady Effervesta, may I just say: your new scent is very artistic.}}
:{{text|say|Marron Glassee|Do I detect a hint of <race>? An exotic choice.}}
:{{text|say|Marron Glassee|All pleasantries aside, please assist me!}}

Interact with Marron:
:Here's the problem for you to judge, Lady Effervesta.
:I believe I am the smelliest, but Timura says SHE is the smelliest because of her new Hat-Of-Stench.
:My argument is that the smell should come from within, not a hat!
*{{gossip|quest=|Timura is smelliest. The Hat-Of-Stench is a creative way to be smellier.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|Marron is the smelliest. It should be a natural body scent we judge by.}}
*{{gossip|quest=|I am the smelliest! Does my stench not fester in your nostrils?!}}

Pick any option:
:{{text|say|Timura Nilla|We accept your judgement, but I...}}
:{{text|say|Timura Nilla|Wait! You're not the Lady Redolence! The scent is fading fast. Where is she?}}
:{{text|say|Pestering Niffen|You can't trick us!}}

On complete:
:{{text|say|Effervesta|So, Myrrit. How've you been?}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|Oh, I'm good. How're you?}}
:{{text|say|Effervesta|So busy! I can barely get a breath in!}}
