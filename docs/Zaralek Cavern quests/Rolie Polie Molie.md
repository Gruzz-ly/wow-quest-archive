:Greetings, greetings!

:Care to help us gather some snail slime for our best smellies?

:<Olie snickers>

:We niffen make the best smellies, but... I can help you get good at it too!

:{{Gossip|I'm ready.}}
:{{Text|say|Olie says: The best way to get snail slime is to sneak up underneath them and then jump out and scare them!}}

Control a [[Curious Niffen]] with the following abilities:
#Jump
#Dig Faster
#Dig Deeper

Jump on [[Slimy Whelk]]s, then walk through the slimes on the ground to collect them. Jumping on a single whelk several times angers them with Irritated. When it reaches 3 stacks, they attack with the Fury of the Snails.
