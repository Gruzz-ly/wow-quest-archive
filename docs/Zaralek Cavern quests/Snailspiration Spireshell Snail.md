'''Snailspiration: Spireshell Snail''' becomes available after summoning a [[Spireshell Snail]].

==Objectives==
Summon a max-level Spireshell Snail battle pet and show it to Briggul.
*Max level Spireshell Snail shown to [[Briggul]]

==Description==
I smell a [[snail]] on you, but it's strange. You holding out on me?

Not many people know this, but snails are incredibly susceptible to peer pressure. Show off that wonder-snail you got there, and let's get [[Big Slick in the City|Slick]] inspired.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Glimmerogg Racer]]

==Progress==
Show me that snail! Let's inspire Slick to be his best slimy self.

==Completion==
I'm sure Slick a-SPIRES to be as strong as your snail there! Ha!

<Briggul wipes a joyful tear from her eye.>

I should bring that one to the next race. The other trainers are going to eat it up.

==Notes==
Speak with Briggul:
:{{Gossip|<Show Briggul your level 25 Spireshell Snail.>}}

==Patch changes==
