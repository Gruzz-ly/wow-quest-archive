==Description==
[[File:Buzzing Orb.jpg|thumb|upright|Buzzing Orb]]

[[Scalecommander Emberthal|Emberthal]] wanted this guy [[Sarkareth]] dealt with yesterday. I understand! I hate waiting too!

This door is frustratingly hard to crack... But! I have a plan because I always have a plan! My recipe for success is being one step ahead of everyone else. It's worked for me so far! Sorta.

So, about this plan... I might need your help!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* [[Buzzing Orb Core]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +50 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
Were you able to get me some of those orbs?

==Completion==
[[Tuberros]] is a life saver! These should do just fine! Now give me a moment to figure the energy flux and flaw and... hmm... Yes... no, nope, ok, maybe...

:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|I am one step ahead of you! But there's just one thing I didn't calculate into my plans...}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|The door's energy core is depleted, so... not sure what to do about that.}}
:{{text|say|Perisimona|Hey, my sporepaws... What about the machines outside? The ones that make that terrible buzzing sound?}}
:{{text|say|Tuberros|Oh yes! The buzz-orbs!}}
:{{text|say|Perisimona|I dared Tuberros to touch one, and it burned him, the poor thing. Smelled like roasted cave bat for weeks!}}
:{{text|say|Tuberros|Maybe if you bring some orbs to the door, they'll zap it open for you!}}
:{{text|say|Rannan Korren|Sounds like a plan!}}

A [[Buzzing Orb Core (quest item)]] drops from [[Nal ks'kol Defense Orb]]s and can also be found in [[Buzzing Orb]]s on the ground. Gather six.
