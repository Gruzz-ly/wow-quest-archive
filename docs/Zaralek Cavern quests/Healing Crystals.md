[[File:Healing Crystals.jpg|thumb|Crystalline elementals at the [[Viridian Throne]]]]

;First time
:Greetings! 
:Apologies if I seem... distracted. I have been beside myself worrying about my injured friends. 
:But maybe you, gentle<class>, can assist us?
:[[Earthmender Narvra|Narvra]] needs aid in healing us. Shards from [[crystal elemental]]s have healing properties. I feel terrible asking to harm a fellow elemental, but if you could... obtain some from them, that would greatly aid my friends.
:Don't worry--the elementals will regenerate in time. My friends' needs come first, however impolite our gathering methods may be.
;High renown
:<Name>?
:Oh my goodness, it is good to see you! I would provide refreshments but we are in a bit of a pickle unfortunately. Can you help?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* +250 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Have you retrieved the crystals? I'm worried about [[Chef Butterfingers|Butterfingers]]; he's not doing well.

==Completion==
<Narvra winces.>

Thank you. These crystals should allow us to heal everyone once again.

Myself included.

==Notes==
On approach:
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|Thank you for...arg... stopping when you saw us. I can't heal them...}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|You are all severely wounded. Let me take a look...}}

Rupert has gossip after accepting the quest:
:Hello <name>. I would provide refreshments, but we are in quite the predicament. 
:We were attacked by djaradin while on our way to investigate the tower to the north and had to beat a hasty retreat. We are not in good shape. We lost one of our members and suffered a large amount of injuries.
:Would you be able to render assistance?

Pick up [[Satiating Sharpbeak]] and [[Medicinal Fungi]] before heading out.

Defeat [[Viridian Colossus|viridian colossi]], [[Viridian Nugget|nuggets]], and [[Viridian Rager|ragers]] for their [[Viridian Heartcrystal]].

On return:
:{{text|say|Earthmender Narvra|Maybe... maybe I can try a different healing spell...}}
:{{text|say|Veritistrasz|Save your strength. <Name> is returning. Once we neutralize the poison, we can work on healing you and your team.}}

After picking up any of the initial three quests, head north into the [[Sulfur Wastes]] to find the corpse of [[Sheridon Hastle]] at {{co|43.0|60.4|Zaralek Cavern}} just off the road. It has this gossip:
:<Before you lies the body of a Wildhammer dwarf dressed in Dragonscale Explorers attire.
:It has clearly been stabbed multiple times with djaradin weapons. This must be their dead camp member Sheridon Hastle. 
:You imagine the Dragonscale camp members would like his effects returned.>
:{{gossip|<Recover Sheridon's effects.>}}

Recovering [[Sheridon Hastle's Effects]] starts [[Fallen Effects]].
