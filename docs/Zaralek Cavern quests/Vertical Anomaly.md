:{{Text|say|Myrrit|Look at the sparklies here! You like sparklies, right?}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|It's so glowy.}}
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|This looks like a room that [[Effie]] and I would have avoided. Floating magic things are dangerous for [[niffen]]!}}

[[Empowered Wyrmling]]s are flying about and on the ground is a [[Pressure Plate]] and a [[Steam Fissure]].

:{{Text|say|Myrrit|I smell something shiny and full of power!}}

Destroy two crystals - one on the right side, one on the left side. Put Myrrit down on the Pressure Plate and enter the middle bubble. Jump and start floating through the other smaller bubbles and find [[Floating Chest]] to loot the Waterlogged Key. Then return and open the Lost Dive Box.
:{{Text|say|Myrrit|What a crazy place. Effie would have suggested we just find a new place, but you handled it so well!}}
