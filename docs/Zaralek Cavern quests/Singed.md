[[File:Singed.jpg|thumb|Marithos, Amythora, Scalecommander Emberthal, and the Destroyed Oathbinder]]

==Objectives==
Talk to Marithos and Amythora [[Sundered Flame]].{{sic}}
* Talk to [[Amythora]]
* Talk to [[Marithos]]

==Description==
Standing here, seeing these two Sundered Flame before me, there is no more anger. I see the confusion in their eyes and how they look at each other... They are so uncertain of their future.

They remind me of myself and the moment I emerged alone, my creche dead and forgotten by passing ages.

I have to talk to them, <name>. Will you accompany me? As a friend?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +50 [[reputation]] with [[Obsidian Warders]]
* +50 reputation with [[Dark Talons]]

==Progress==
I want to help them... be there for them when no one was there for me.

==Completion==
Perhaps I could help them cope with their feelings of abandonment. Maybe... I can reconcile my own past and lead them to a better future--one they deserve.

==Notes==
On accept:
:''Emberthal walks forward.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|I am Scalecommander Emberthal. I know you have just been through something terrible.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|You have been abandoned by your leader. Let me help you.}}

Ebyssian has new gossip:
:I am proud of Emberthal's compassion, leadership, and patience. Uniting the dracthyr one by one will take time, but I am optimistic about Emberthal's future.

Speak with Amythora:
:I used to tremble when I heard the name Emberthal. Sarkareth told us she had committed atrocities. I thought that she was vicious, brutal, and cruel.
:I now see clearly that Sarkareth was not who I thought he was, and neither was Emberthal. She could have ended our lives... but now she wants us to follow her?
:{{gossip|Emberthal would welcome you with open arms.}}
:''Amythora cheers.''

And with Marithos:
:Sarkareth left us behind. I would have never left him; I would have died for him! 
:He is not the leader I thought he was.
:I need to figure out where to go from here.
:{{gossip|Would you join Emberthal's cause?}}
:''Marithos bows.''

On complete:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Come with me to Loamm. I have much to discuss with you.}}
:{{text|say|Marithos|I am right behind you, Scalecommander.}}
:{{text|say|Amythora|We both are.}}
:''The dracthyr walk out of Nal ks'kol.''

==Progression==
