==Objectives==
Set up a dig for [[Myrrit]] and [[Effervesta]].
*Talk to Effervesta {{co|54.6|59.4|Zaralek Cavern}}
*Give Myrrit the good news
*[[Squishy Snack]] bought from [[Floressa|Innkeeper]] {{co|56.4|55.8|Zaralek Cavern}}
*Check on Myrrit at the "Secret Spot"

==Description==
Really, I have fun digging with you. I do! Please, don't take this badly, but... I miss my best friend.

I don't blame her for being busy. She was kidnapped, and she is the princess! I know she doesn't have lots of time. I just wish... 

...I don't know.

Maybe I wish things were the way they used to be, when she wanted to dig with me.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +125 [[reputation]] with [[Loamm Niffen]]

==Progress==
It's Effervesta's favorite snack...

==Completion==
Maybe she forgot, or she's still busy.

==Notes==
Check in with [[Effervesta]] near her usual spot. She's being accosted by [[Marron Glassee]], [[Timura Nilla]], and a bunch of [[Pestering Niffen]]. Marron, who has a particularly putrid stench, has gossip:
:I'm not leaving until this is solved once and for all.

Speak with Effervesta:
:I'm very busy. Can you be quick?

:{{gossip|quest=|Myrrit is wondering if you have time to go on a dig with him.}}
:{{text|say|Effervesta|Oh, I'd love to!}}
:{{text|say|Pestering Niffen (1)|Lady Effervesta, I have a question.}}
:{{text|say|Effervesta|I just have so little time. I've been so busy... as you can see!}}
:{{text|say|Pestering Niffen (2)|Effervesta, we need to know what you want us to do.}}
:{{text|say|Effervesta|Tell Myrrit I'll meet him at our spot. It's at the bridge southwest of Loamm. I'll be right there!}}
:{{text|say|Pestering Niffen (3)|My question is urgent!}}
:{{text|say|Effervesta|One at a time, please. I'll help each of you, just one at a time.}}

She has new gossip:
:I just have to find some time for Myrrit.

Back to Myrrit:
:What did she say?
:{{gossip|quest=|Effervesta says she will meet with you at your 'spot.'}}
:{{text|emote|Myrrit beams with happiness.}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|This is fantastic! I'm so excited. I'm going to head over right away!}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|I want to surprise her with a treat, though. Can you pick up a Squishy Snack and meet us at the secret spot?}}
:''He runs off.''

Head to the main building and check in with [[Floressa]] to purchase a [[Squishy Sack]] for {{cost||10}}, then head southwest out of town across the bridge to find Myrrit, but no Effervesta...
:{{text|say|Myrrit|She... didn't come.}}

On complete:
:{{text|emote|Myrrit sighs.}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|I'm trying not to take it personally.}}
:''Myrrit sadly walks back toward town.''
:{{text|say|Myrrit|I do enjoy going on digs with you, <name>. It's just not the same. That's all.}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|She's my best friend. It feels like I'm losing her.}}
:{{text|say|Myrrit|We'll dig again soon, though, okay? You and me.}}

Check back in with Myrrit again for the next quest, [[The Heavy Crown]].
