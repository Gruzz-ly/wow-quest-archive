'''Snailspiration: Rapana Whelk''' becomes available after summoning a [[Rapana Whelk]].

==Objectives==
Summon a max-level Rapana Whelk battle pet and show it to Briggul.
*Max level Rapana Whelk shown to [[Briggul]]

==Description==
I smell a [[snail]] on you, but it's strange. You holding out on me?

Not many people know this, but snails are incredibly susceptible to peer pressure. Show off that wonder-snail you got there, and let's get [[Big Slick in the City|Slick]] inspired.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* +100 [[reputation]] with [[Glimmerogg Racer]]

==Progress==
Show me that snail! Let's inspire Slick to be his best slimy self.

==Completion==
Don't let that one fool you, <name>. I can sense the shell of a killer. Hope Slick is more inspired than spooked!

==Notes==
Speak with Briggul:
:{{Gossip|<Show Briggul your level 25 Rapana Whelk.>}}

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.1.0|note=Added.}}
