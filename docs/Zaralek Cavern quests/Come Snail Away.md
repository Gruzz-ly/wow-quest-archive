==Objectives==
Introduce yourself to Slick.
* [[Big Slick in the City|Slick]] met

==Description==
Hmm. You ever mount a snail before?

I've trained generations of racing snail champions, but now I've come across my toughest case yet. Problem is he's too crokin' big. Straight up barred from competition.

It's a shame to keep such a prize specimen stuck in a bucket though. If you can help me train Slick up to be the speedster I know he is, we'll call him yours!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]
* [[Conch Whistle]]

==Progress==
The big guy's racing name is Big Slick in the City, but we just call him Slick.

==Completion==
He likes you! Well, he doesn't dislike you. Hard to tell with snails.

Now you just need to come back here every day for Slick's training regimen. He may be slow now, but we'll get him up to speed.

==Notes==
[[Big Slick in the City]] is a couple of yards to [[Briggul]]'s right. Interact with the snail to make... introductions. Once done, Briggul offers a daily quest to work on her [[Glimmerogg Racer]] personal friendship reputation.

==Progression==
{{Snail Racing}}

==Patch changes==
