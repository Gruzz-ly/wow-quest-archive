==Objectives==
Speak with [[Sabellian]].

==Description==
By my scales, I needed that win! [[Fyrakk|That blasted Incarnate]] swatting us like flies did a number on my ego, and I assume Sabellian feels no different. 

As infuriating as I find his lack of humor, groaning voice, and ugly shoes... I would ask that you check in on him. He is still family, after all, and I do not wish him to become dinner to these [[deepflayer]]s.

Meet [[Elder Honeypelt|Honeypelt]] and I outside [[Deepflayer Nest|these dreadful nests]] when you finish up with Sabellian.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* {{cost|2|80|90}}
* 1,200 [[XP]]

==Completion==
I could hear you and [[Wrathion]]'s yawping from all the way over here.

If you have finished with all that, why not take a look at this, <name>.

==Notes==
Sabellian is not far to the southeast, looking at a Scavenged Relic. On approach:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|This certainly looks like one of [[Deathwing|father]]'s gadgets...}}

==Progression==
{{Underground 1}}
