==Description==
Because of our recent conflicts, I have been researching the [[djaradin]]. Our archives had little information on their elders.

Legends say that they were once great warlords who now slumber beneath the earth. The djaradin believe they will awaken and lead them to a brutal victory against the [[dragonflight]]s.

We need to know what we are up against. There is an empty shrine just below us that resembles the ones housing the elders. 

We may find some answers there.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
From what we have gathered so far, it seems that [[Iridikron]] has made a deal with the Zaqali and sent the [[Primalists]] to awaken their elders.

Do they merely share a common enemy, or is Iridikron receiving something else in return?

==Notes==
On accept, Ebyssian joins the player and follows along and will help out in combat. While on these quests, players are buffed with:
:{{Abilities|Protection of Ebon Flight|Health increased by 200%. Damage taken reduced by 80%. Immune to knockback effects. Regenerating 2% health every 3 sec.|id=403726|icon=inv_icon_wing08e}}

In the lava river is a small island with a big pot of incense. Interact with it:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|The Zaqali honor the strength of the earth and the ferocity of fire. This caldera is a place of violence, yet they revere it.}}

The next island south has a Thrumming Earthstone:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|One of Iridikron's sigils... An ancient alliance between the Zaqali and the Primalists, paid for in the blood of dragons.}}

To the west is a broken pot of Cached Weaponry:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|This seems to have contained the elder's armaments. The Zaqali are smiths of vicious weapons.}}

To the north is a polearm on the ground, a Battered Ebon Armament:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|These artifacts are neither Zaqali nor Primalist. This looks like something Neltharion had crafted. Have these djaradin found his laboratory?}}

Further north is a Prayer Tablet:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|They have been trying to awaken their elders all this time. This elder, Rashok, was missing since they first discovered the cavern.}}

It reads:
{{book|Prayer Tablet|content=
<poem>
Hear our prayers, O Elders -- though slumbering beneath the earth,
Our voices rise like the smoke of sacrifice
To reach the heights you have conquered.

Igira -- cruelest of djaradin, mastersmith of legend. 
Awaken! 
Reforge us in glory, our spirits quenched in mighty blood;
O Igira, the earth and the sky bend under your hammer.

Vakan -- the blackened bone within the fires.
Awaken!
All flame casts shadows and cinders still smolder within;
O Vakan, who taught us the voice of the ashes.

Gholna -- in one arm, the strength of ten thousand.
Awaken! 
Shatter the sky with flame and anoint us in its rain.
O Gholna, the lava trembles to behold your heat.

Rashok -- great warrior of molten flame.
Stolen!
The dragons feared you even in your dreamless sleep.
O Rashok, who will feed the flames with ebon blood once more.
</poem>

Afterwords, Ebyssian says:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I believe we have learned enough at this shrine. Let us find Sabellian, and our next target.}}

Catch up with Sabellian inside a small cave that has a dead [[Massive Corebeast]] and (spoiler alert!) a [[Spirit Healer]] in it:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Sabellian! What happened here?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|We required this cave to stay undetected, and the beast would have raised the alarm.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I suppose... what is done is done.}}
