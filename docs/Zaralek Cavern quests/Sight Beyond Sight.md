[[File:Sight Beyond Sight.jpg|thumb|[[Zaqali Farseer]] and [[Flamesight Totem]]]]

==Objectives==
Inspect nearby [[Flamesight Totem]]s to find a way to activate the [[Greater Flamesight Totem]] atop the guard tower.
* [[Flamesight Rune]] (3)
* [[Greater Flamesight Rune]] {{co|35.5|42.2|Zaralek Cavern}}
* Greater Flamesight Totem activated {{co|35.5|42.1|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
[[File:Flamesight Totem.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Flamesight Totem]]]]
I had not expected to find [[djaradin]] here, though it does not surprise me. Legends tell of their elders slumbering beneath the earth. It makes sense that some would delve underground in search of them.

Their forces are heavily guarding this outer area. I recognize the magic their scouts are using--it is [[Far Sight|farsight]], powered by those totems near them.

I spotted a larger totem at the top of the nearby tower. If you can figure out how to power it, we can use it to search the caldera from afar.

==Rewards==
You will receive one of:
* [[Endowed Mantle]]
* [[Inherited Epaulets]]
* [[Bequeathed Spaulders]]
* [[Bestowed Pauldrons]]

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
This tower provides the best vantage point in the caldera.

If there is any evidence that [[Fyrakk]] came through here--or worse--we will see it.

==Completion==
<[[Ebyssian]] narrows his eyes in contemplation. At last, he sighs a deep breath and sets his jaw.>

We cannot act yet. We need more information, and a better opening.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Ebyssian, let us scout the caldera while <name> handles the djaradin.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|So long as we do not run headlong into danger.}}
:''They walk off.''

[[Zaqali Farseer]]s in the area are channeling [[Far Sight]] near [[Flamesight Totem]]s. Interact with the totems for their [[Flamesight Rune]]. After acquiring three, head uphill along the path to the west to find [[High Seer Jhatal]] and two [[Blazing Hound]]s guarding the entrance to the watchtower. Aggro her:
:{{text|say|High Seer Jhatal|You dare invade the sacred grounds of the Zaqali? I will feed your broken body to the hounds!}}

[[File:Greater Flamesight Totem.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Greater Flamesight Totem]]]]
Defeat her:
:{{text|say|High Seer Jhatal|Iridikron... will uphold... his bargain...}}
:''Ebyssian and Sabellian run up, then head up to the top of the tower.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Well done, <name>. That rune should power the totem I saw at the top of this tower. We have discovered several locations to scout.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Accurate intelligence is a boon to any operation, especially one as small as ours.}}

Follow them up top and interact with the [[Greater Flamesight Totem]] to start an in-engine cutscene:
{{#ev:youtube|IX6-fKU2q3E}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Let us see what they are guarding...}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Those massive djaradin...}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|they are beyond anything we encountered in the Waking Shores.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Those are djaradin elders. Not just dragonslayers, but slayers of entire bloodlines.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Look there!}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|That one appears to still be slumbering.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|And the [[Primalists]] are awakening her. We must stop them. Quickly.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Wait. Do you sense it?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|That flame infusing the lava...}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Is it...}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|[[Shadowflame]]. The poison that drove [[Neltharion]] to madness.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|We must end this. The corruption cannot be allowed to spread.}}
