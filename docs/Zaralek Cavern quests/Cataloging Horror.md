==Objectives==
Use the Cataloging Camera to take pictures of experiment dumping sites in the [[Acidbite Ravine]].
* Photograph Evidence (6)
* [[Cataloging Camera]] (provided)

==Description==
I... I need to bring the evidence of this insanity back to [[Black dragonflight|my flight]]. It may destroy us, but my people need to know what happened here.

I borrowed some cataloging cameras from [[Tellywin Sharpfizzle|Tellywin]]. Can you join me in documenting these atrocities?

I can provide you with a similar protection to that which I gave in the vault. I will leave any fighting to you; I cannot bring myself to cause any more suffering than my flight has already wrought.

Let us be done with this as swiftly as possible.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 47,600 [[XP]]
* +75 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
I can barely believe what was done here...

==Completion==
Thank you. To know that this was occurring before my flight's fall...  sickens me to my core.

I will take these photographs to our leaders. If we cannot learn from our history, we are doomed to repeat it.

==Notes==
Pick up all three quests before heading out. Voraxian provides a buff:
:{{Abilities|Voraxian's Enveloping Scales|Voraxian has empowered you with the strength of his flight. Armor is increased by 1,000. Maximum Health is increased by 50%.|id=411801|icon=ability_monk_dragonkick}}

Get to killing, capturing evidence, and totem placing.

Evidence is handily marked with magical yellow chevrons pointing down at it. While standing in front of the evidence, use the provided [[Cataloging Camera]], hold still for a moment, then use the vehicle interface's #1 ability to actually take a shot:
#{{abilities|Catalog|Stand still to take pictures of nearby evidence.|id=406246|range=70|cd=3 sec|notes=Instant}}

Voraxian can say one of:
*{{text|say|Voraxian|What could lead someone to do this...}}
*{{text|say|Voraxian|Is this what my flight was even before they fell to the [[Old God]]s?}}

After six:
:{{text|say|Voraxian|<Name>, what we have documented here is... abhorrent. I do not know what to do.}}
:{{text|say|Voraxian|How can we reconcile what we did with the future of our flight?}}

Turn in to Voraxian whenever, then head north along the river for the other two quests.

On return:
:{{text|say|[[Earthmender Narvra]]|Ok, everyone! Take your places. We should start this ritual as soon as we can.}}

==Progression==
