==Objectives==
Eliminate 6 Enraged Watchers in the [[Buried Vault]]s.
* [[Enraged Watcher]] slain (6)

==Description==
How incredibly rude! I know we did not bring gifts, but this is hardly the way to greet visitors! There is no excuse for such terrible manners! Scoundrels! Cads! Brutes!

<[[Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|Rupert]] coughs into his hand.>

What I meant to say was these watchers appear to be a threat. Anyone who tunnels in here could be in danger. 

Would you be able to make this place safer by eliminating them?

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|21|6|75}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 28,550 [[XP]]
* +150 [[reputation]] with [[Dragonscale Expedition]]

==Progress==
Such terrible manners are inexcusable...

==Completion==
Good show, <name>. This place is much safer now. Those Ruffians will not bother anyone else.

==Notes==
Pick up [[A Room Without a View]] before heading out. On accept of both:
:{{text|say|Voraxian|Here. Allow me to bestow upon you my bulwark. I hope it will aid you against the watchers!}}
:{{text|say|Rupert, the Gentleman Elemental|And give those churlish watchers a jolly hard kick in the breeches for me!}}

Players are buffed with:
:{{Abilities|Voraxian's Bulwark|Voraxian has empowered you with the strength of his flight. Damage taken reduced by 50%. Damage increased by 200%.|id=400396|icon=inv_shield_1h_revenantfire_d_01}}

Get to killing while clearing a path to the back of the vault.

==Progression==
{{Medicinal Fungi}}
