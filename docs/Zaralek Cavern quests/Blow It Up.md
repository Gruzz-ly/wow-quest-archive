==Objectives==
Destroy the [[djaradin]] heavy weaponry in the [[Battlefield Ruins]].
* [[Dragonslayer Ballista]] destroyed (4)

==Description==
Make no mistake, the djaradin are experienced [[dragon]] killers. But right now their ruthless tactics are overshadowed by the devastating power of their battlefield ballistae, capable of taking out any threat from a long distance.

I have lost many good soldiers to these potent weapons.

It is essential that we destroy the ballistae if we hope to level the playing field and take to the skies. It is possible that we may even be able to gain the upper hand in this war.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
Report, soldier.

==Completion==
We can see the smoke from up here! Good job.

==Notes==
On accept of all three:
:{{text|say|Field Commander Ignax|Glory to the [[black dragonflight]].}}

Use the sack of bombs still equipped on the player's back to blow up ballistae all over the [[Battlefield Ruins]]. The four ballistae are marked on the map and are operated by [[Zaqali Arbalist]]s.

Blow up the fourth:
:{{text|say|Field Commander Ignax|The ballistae are destroyed!}}
:{{text|say|Field Commander Ignax|Soldiers, send for the dragon lords! Our victory is near.}}
