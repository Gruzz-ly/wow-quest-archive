==Objectives==
Find the venom of the beast that bit [[Skuttog]].
* Cave entrance found {{co|54.8|65.8|Zaralek Cavern}}
* [[Crawler Venom]] (6)
* [[Broodmother Venom]] {{co|52.6|65.3|Zaralek Cavern}}

==Description==
We found Skuttog near a cave to the north, by some nasty spiders. It seems like his skin is turning into bone.

I can heal him, but I need venom from whatever bit him. Please help.

==Rewards==
{{itembox|You will be able to choose one of these rewards:
|Satchel of Healing Spores
|Friendship Censer
|Djaradin Boasting Tablets
|Suspended Sulfuric Droplet
|Drogbar Rocks
|Drogbar Stones
}}

You will also receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]

==Progress==
Please hurry. He's almost a statue already.

==Completion==
This should be enough. Let's see if it works.

==Notes==
Head northeast to the [[Crystal Fields]] and enter the cave where [[Spinmarrow]] spawns, then get to killing [[Calcifying Crawler]]s for their [[Crawler Venom]] and the [[Osseous Broodmother]] for the [[Broodmother Venom]].

Defeat the neutral [[Bone Collector]]s to encourage hostile crawlers to spawn!
