==Objectives==
Defeat the [[djaradin]] forces and stop their advance in the [[Battlefield Ruins]].
* Fly with [[Ebyssian]]
* Djaradin Forces defeated (0/100%)
*Reach the Ledge

==Description==
<As [[Field Commander Ignax|Ignax]] looks up, you see a small smile appear on his face.>

Few of my soldiers have experience fighting alongside dragons. What a glorious day.

Their presence gives us confidence, <class>. Now we must put an end to the djaradin's advance once and for all.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* [[Whelpling's Shadowflame Crest]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Completion==
This must be the nesting area mentioned in the stolen report.

But why are the djaradin here dead? 

Are we too late?

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Today we remind our enemies that these lands are under our protection.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|It is time we take back what is ours.}}

Speak with Ebyssian, who has new gossip:
:The Zaralek Cavern was long forgotten--just like our forces still stationed here, fighting in our flight's name. 
:It is time we send a message to our enemies.
*{{gossip|Why are the djaradin here?}}
:Local scouts have observed increased djaradin activity in the area in recent days. 
:Given your discovery, it would seem their plan is to break into Aberrus and rescue some entity they refer to as the "elder." 
:Could it be their old leader or some other equally important figure?
*{{gossip|quest=|Let's fly.}}

Players enter the vehicle interface as Ebyssian goes on a bombing run:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Everyone, get ready. It is our flight's duty to stop the djaradin army.}}
#{{Abilities|Fire Breath|Hurl a fireball to a location.|range=500|cd=1.5 sec|notes=Instant|id=404735|icon=inv_misc_head_dragon_01}}
#{{Abilities|Black Dragon's Roar|Let out a mighty roar and summon the white-hot fury of the black dragons.|range=500|cd=1.5 sec|notes=Instant|id=409673|icon=ability_warrior_dragonroar}}

Take potshots at everything that moves. Once the quota of death is done, Ebyssian flies east:
:{{text|say|Field Commander Ignax|Commander, our scouts have found dragon nests to the east.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I do not like this.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Neither do I. The Field Commander can maintain control on the battlefield while we investigate.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|What happened here?}}
