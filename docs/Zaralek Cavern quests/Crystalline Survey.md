==Notes==
[[Mordigan Ironjaw]], [[Examiner Rowe]], [[LOU-C Fitzcog]] and [[Aelnara]] of the [[Dragonscale Expedition]] have set up and are curious how the [[Agitated Crystalline]] elementals in the area work:
:{{text|say|Mordigan Ironjaw|Ho, friend! We could use a helpin' hand! Those crystal monsters 're all worked up by our geoscanner! Take 'em down so we can study their materials!}}
:{{text|say|Examiner Rowe|An actually fruitful geological survey, this time. One can hope.}}
:{{text|say|LOU-C Fitzcog|Not a grain of salt in sight!}}
:{{text|emote|Aelnara sighs.}}

Kill Agitated Crystalline crystal golems for 2-3% progress each and members of the expedition can say at random:
*{{text|say|Mordigan Ironjaw|Argh! Hard enough 'ta crack my teeth!}}
*{{text|say|Examiner Rowe|Did it bleed? No? ... Pity.}}
*{{text|say|Mordigan Ironjaw|Hard, crunchy, stale but with a slight zing... These crystals are old, very old.}}
*{{text|say|Mordigan Ironjaw|Hmm... Not salty enough.}}
*{{text|say|LOU-C Fitzcog|I wonder how these creatures are powered? They certainly aren't mechanical.}}
*{{text|say|Examiner Rowe|No fluids at all, hm? Interesting.}}
*{{text|say|Examiner Rowe|The fracture pattern here is... mesmerizing.}}

At 100%:
:{{text|say|LOU-C Fitzcog|That's all the data we can get for now! Team, what are our conclusions?}}
:{{text|say|Mordigan Ironjaw|Slick material! May be useful in 'ta forge, though probably not 'ta cooking pot. Needs more salt!}}
:{{text|say|Examiner Rowe|The luminosity is a fascinating feature. I would like to study it more.}}
:{{text|say|Aelnara|We've barely scratched the surface of why the crystals are forming into monsters. Is something infusing them with magic? We need more time and resources to study.}}
:{{text|say|LOU-C Fitzcog|Well, sounds like there's more to be done, as always!}}
