==Objectives==
Speak with [[Vaskarn]].

==Description==
Quite a few uplanders have arrived since the cavern was split clean open! 

A friendly winged-one by the name of Vaskarn has been particularly helpful to us. She's made the guard's{{sic}} armor tougher and the monster hunter's{{sic}} weapons stronger.

She's going to be plenty valuable if you plan on taking down more giant beasties here in Zaralek!

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Got quite the gear on you! Shall we see what we can make of it?

==Notes==
After picking up all three quests and speaking with Brynnsahce:
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Woah... You smell completely different to anything I've ever smelled. Even Elder Honeypelt doesn't come back with scents this unexpected.}}
:{{text|say|Aurantia|Why don't we all move to Carrilion Belfry? We're clogging up the streets here.}}
:{{text|say|Brynnsahce|Anyway!  I'll be your guide in Loamm.  Let me show you why Elder Honeypelt chose me as her monster hunter apprentice!}}
:''The players all move north.''

[[Vaskarn]] is inside the inn, not far from [[Cuzolth]], the item upgrader, and [[Floressa]], the innkeeper.
