==Objectives==
Deliver Vibrant Wildercloth Bolts to [[Rossmar]] in [[Loamm]].
*[[Vibrant Wildercloth Bolt]] {{Profquality|2}} (75)

==Description==
The kith of Loamm request the skills of a talented [[tailor]]! We niffen are terribly curious about the magical finery you create here!

We have our own stitchers and clothes-makers down below. Mister Rossmar has expressed an interest in the procurement of bolts of high quality cloth!

Make a delivery to Loamm as soon as you can, won't you?

==Progress==
Did [[Kayann]] send you? Oh, thank the soil!

I need those bolts of cloth, and quickly!

==Completion==
Ohhh, this is wonderful cloth! It glides so gently through my claws, but also feel strong enough to withstand daily use!

And you delivered it just in time! What's the emergency? Well...
