==Objectives==
Disperse 12 patches of [[shadowflame]] by [[dragonriding]] through them.
* Shadowflame dispersed (12)
* Head into [[Loamm]]

==Description==
The shadowflame has already corrupted [[Fyrakk]] irreparably. Every place in [[Zaralek Cavern|Zaralek]] darkened by his wings has been lit ablaze with shadowflame.

We cannot leave it behind and let it fester--it will need to be extinguished while it is still kindling, lest we allow its corruption to take root.

<[[Ebyssian]] coughs, then winces.>

[[Sabellian]] and I cannot take to the air in this state. Disperse the flames with your drake. We will follow you below and meet you back at Loamm.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Completion==
[[Titan]]s forgive us... 

There will be worse than this to come.

==Notes==

On accept:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|We must gather our strength, but the [[niffen]] of Loamm cannot wait. Take to the skies, <name>. We will follow shortly.}}
:''They run off.''

Fly through all twelve rings near the shadowflame, then head into Loamm, which is also alight:
:''Sabellian and Ebyssian run up.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|By the titans...}}

The town's buildings are on shadowflame. On the ground are the bodies of [[Incinerated Villager]]s, and [[Terrified Niffen]] run about.
