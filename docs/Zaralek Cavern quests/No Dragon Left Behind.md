[[File:From Hell's Heart - after.jpg|thumb|[[Ebyssian]] speared and [[Sabellian]] wounded]]

==Objectives==
Find a way to remove the spear from [[Ebyssian]]'s side.
* Pull the spear out by hand
* Pull the spear out with more leverage
* Let [[Sabellian]] help
* Remove the heated spear

==Description==
I... cannot move so long as this spear remains in my side. But we need to follow [[Fyrakk]]'s trail.

<Ebyssian grunts sharply, his breathing labored, claws digging into the dirt.>

Remove it. I can... bear the pain it will cause.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* [[Draconic Cauterizing Magma]]
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]
* +130 [[reputation]] with [[Valdrakken Accord]]

==Progress==
He did not leave me.

I cannot leave him.

==Completion==
We should both be able to walk. 

Fyrakk has left a trail of destruction across the cavern. We must help any harmed by him, even if we can do nothing to stop him.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|You must... remove it quickly... I need to-- to...}}

Interact with Ebyssian to attempt to pull the spear out by hand:
:''Sabellian gets to his feet.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|...Ebyssian?}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Sabellian, I--I am sorry...}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Hush. Save your strength. It is my turn to tend to your wounds.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I tried to save us but-- I hesitated.}}

Interact with Ebyssian again to hook a rope around the spear, then drag it 20 yards away:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|You cannot just... rip their spears out. The barbs... hook behind our scales.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I can heat the metal to soften the spearhead. Let-- ugh. Let me gather my strength.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Sabellian, you are injured.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I would give everything I have to save you, brother.}}

Speak with Sabellian:
:[[Djaradin]] spears are crafted to hook into our scales. Removing it by force will cause untold damage, if you even succeed.
:It is why I intended to use such a weapon on Fyrakk.
:<Sabellian glances down at his burned arm, then at the spear in Ebyssian's side. He grimaces at himself.>
:Let me help him.
:{{gossip|Do what you can.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|This will hurt. But it will also cauterize the wound.}}
:''Sabellian channels a fire spell into Ebyssian's wound, heating the spear in the process.''
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|AAGH! Ah--nnn....}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|That... That is all I have left. It is done. Remove the spear before it cools, <name>. I have not the strength anymore.}}

Interact with Ebyssian one last time to finally pull the spear out of him. The spear flies out and Ebyssian returns to his visage form.
