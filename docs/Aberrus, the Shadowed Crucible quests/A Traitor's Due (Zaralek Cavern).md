==Objectives==
Defeat the Neltharion Loyalists.
* [[Neltharion Loyalists]] slain (0/100%)

==Description==
These sycophants shame themselves and the [[black dragonflight]]. It is clear that they are willing to die in service of [[Neltharion|my father]]'s dark machinations.

Let us not disappoint them.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
We will never erase this mark on our legacy. But there is no way forward while they yet live.

==Completion==
[[Wrathion]]'s [[Blacktalon]] may not be front-line soldiers, but they should be able to take care of the rest.

==Notes==
Pick up both quests before heading in.

While running north, Wrathion and Sabellian have a conversation:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I knew of Deathwing's corruption when I was still in the shell. But I had no idea how deeply it ran.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Father... pursued his goals with relentless conviction. He was never fond of half measures.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|A trait you admired?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|In some ways, yes. But now, seeing what it can lead to, I am... less certain.}}

On the way, [[Talonstalker Kavia]] has a report:
:{{text|say|Talonstalker Kavia|Sirs!}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Your report?}}
:{{text|say|Talonstalker Kavia|Loyalists remain in the experiments wing, and the laboratories are still infested with warped beasts.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|And the other wing?}}
:{{text|say|Talonstalker Kavia|We're holding against the djaradin, but it is still heavily contested.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Thank you, Kavia.}}

Speak with her:
:Stay alert, <name>. There are more to contend with than just the Neltharion loyalists.

Head down the steps and Wrathion and Sabellian continue:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Such twisted malevolence... the air is thick with it.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|That ends today. This is the final culling.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Was it like this when you hatched? Were the others truly so far gone?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Worse. They weren't haunted echoes he'd left behind. They were devoted followers of the bleak future he'd led them to.}}

Head northwest, defeating [[Obsidian Bulwark|Obsidian bulwarks]], [[Obsidian Magus|magi]], [[Obsidian Soldier|soldiers]], [[Obsidian Tyrant|tyrants]], and [[Obsidian Tormentor|tormentors]] with the help of the Blacktalon, Wrathion and Sabellian.

On the way, note the corpse of the [[Drained Djaradin]], which starts [[Honorbound (quest)]]:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|What is this?}}

On accept of Honorbound:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|The djaradin are ruthless adversaries of our flight. But to be imprisoned and have their life siphoned away... it is too cruel a fate, even for our enemies.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|How long have they been here?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Long enough.}}

Look for cages holding more Drained Djaradin and open the cage doors to free them. After the first:
:{{text|say|Drained Djaradin|If I die, let it be in battle!}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|These pitiful creatures... did father truly hold so little regard for life?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|He cared only about forging a future in which the black dragonflight would be dominant.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|As... as I have done.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|You are not him, Sabellian. You wish to see our kind thrive, not dominate. It is an admirable pursuit.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Thank you, Wrathion. But I must do better.}}

The second and beyond:
:{{text|say|Drained Djaradin|Finally... free...}}
:''The djaradin stumbles out of the cage, then falls forward as it breathes it's last.''

The first specimen tanks for [[Remnants]] show up in the [[Onyx Laboratory]], with some [[Inchoate Beastling]]s nearby. Use the provided [[Blacktalon Napalm]] to destroy the tanks.
