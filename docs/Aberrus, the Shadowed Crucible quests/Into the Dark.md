==Objectives==
Meet with [[Ebyssian]] and [[Emberthal]] in the room at the bottom of the laboratory.
* Reach the upper platform of the [[Onyx Laboratory]] (Optional)
* Ride the [[slitherdrake]]s to [[Neltharion's Sanctum]]
* Pass through the [[Edge of Oblivion]] (Optional)
* Meet up with Ebyssian and Emberthal

==Description==
My [[Blacktalon]] forces continue to secure the laboratory, but I think we are done here, <name>.

We have secured some slitherdrakes to take us down to the central platform. From there we can continue below, to where [[Sarkareth]] fell.

I am certain and Emberthal will benefit from our presence.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|14|4|50}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 4,750 [[XP]]

==Completion==
Good, you have made it. I could use your help, <name>.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|There are some serpent drakes stationed at the top of the Experiments Wing for us, champion.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|They should see us safely to the lower platform.}}

Keep heading north through the [[Onyx Laboratory]] and up the steps. At the top in the southern part of the room are three slitherdrakes ready to go. Interact with the middle drake and it will fly southeast into the molten crucible and then north into [[Neltharion's Sanctum]]. Keep running south and jump through the [[Edge of Oblivion]]. Just before the door to the Sarkareth encounter arena:
:{{text|say|Wrathion|I confess... this is the last place I wanted to revisit.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|I could say the same for this entire facility.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Well then. Let us get this over with.}}

Open the door then jump down to reach Ebyssian and Emberthal, who are looking at the corpse of [[Scalecommander Sarkareth]]. Additionally, two [[Blacktalon Invoker]]s are channeling a portal.
