==Objectives==
Free the imprisoned djaradin.
* [[Djaradin]] freed (5)

==Description==
<The djaradin's body is gaunt and wasted, its life energy siphoned away by the hungry machines that power this dark laboratory.

Perhaps there are other djaradin imprisoned here that can be spared from this horror.>

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|28|9|}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 9,500 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The [[black dragonflight]] is defined by our actions, not our accomplishments.

==Completion==
May they find the honor in death that was denied them in life.

==Notes==
Inside [[Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible]] for [[A Traitor's Due (Zaralek Cavern)]] and [[Remnants]], players will come across the dead [[Drained Djaradin]] that offers this quest.

On accept:
:{{text|say|Sabellian|The djaradin are ruthless adversaries of our flight. But to be imprisoned and have their life siphoned away... it is too cruel a fate, even for our enemies.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|How long have they been here?}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Long enough.}}

Look for cages holding more Drained Djaradin and open the cage doors to free them. After the first:
:{{text|say|Drained Djaradin|If I die, let it be in battle!}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|These pitiful creatures... did father truly hold so little regard for life?}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|He cared only about forging a future in which the black dragonflight would be dominant.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|As... as I have done.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|You are not him, Sabellian. You wish to see our kind thrive, not dominate. It is an admirable pursuit.}}
:{{text|say|Sabellian|Thank you, Wrathion. But I must do better.}}

The second and beyond:
:{{text|say|Drained Djaradin|Finally... free...}}
:''The djaradin stumbles out of the cage, then falls forward as it breathes it's last.''

==Progression==
{{A Flame, Extinguished}}
