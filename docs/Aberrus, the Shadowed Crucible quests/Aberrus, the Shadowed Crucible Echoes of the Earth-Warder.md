'''Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible: Echoes of the Earth-Warder''' is the [[raid skip]] quest for [[Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible]]. Defeat the [[Echo of Neltharion]] three times to skip to him after defeating [[Kazzara, the Hellforged]].

As with other raid skip quests, completing this on higher difficulties will automatically unlock the lower-difficulty skips.

==Objectives==
Collect 3 Tomes of the Earth-Warder from the [[Echo of Neltharion]] within [[Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible]] on <Normal/Heroic/Mythic> Difficulty.
* [[Tome of the Earth-Warder]] (3)

==Description==
I sense a dark presence somewhere within these halls... something strangely familiar. Perhaps it will reveal itself as we explore the many chambers of Aberrus. If you can find evidence of this looming evil, we may be able to gain easier access to the depths below.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|56|18}}
* 13,000 [[XP]]

==Progress==
The knowledge gained from these may allow us to access the lower depths of Aberrus more directly.

==Completion==
These should allow us to descend into the depths of Aberrus more easily.

==Patch changes==
*{{Patch 10.1.0|note=Added.}}
