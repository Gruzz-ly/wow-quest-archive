'''A Flame, Extinguished''' begins the final chapter of the [[Embers of Neltharion campaign]], unlocked the week of 23 May 2023 for players who defeated [[Scalecommander Sarkareth (tactics)|Scalecommander Sarkareth]] in [[Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible]] (or at any time thereafter upon his defeat), or the week of 13 June 2023 for all players regardless of raid progress.

==Objectives==
Speak to [[Wrathion]] or [[Sabellian]].
* Speak to Wrathion or Sabellian to enter Aberrus
* Experience the retelling of [[Sarkareth]]'s fate

==Description==
Sarkareth is no more.

His hubris left him vulnerable to the dark influences that have assaulted our flight for millennia. Just like Neltharion before him.

I believe Emberthal seeks more answers than what Wrathion and Sabellian are able to give. She may need some assistance.

==Rewards==
You will receive:
* {{cost|21|6|75}}
* 10x [[Flightstones]]
* 7,150 [[XP]]

==Progress==
Return to me if you'd like to help further.

==Completion==
Here we are, <name>.

I admit that the [[black dragonflight]]'s legacy is rife with moments that many would deem disreputable, vicious, or even vile.

So understand the weight of my words when I say that the contents of this edifice may be the worst of it.

==Notes==
On accept:
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|Sarkareth...}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|I am sorry for the friend you lost.}}
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Emberthal|As you said, he chose his path. And yet... though he was deeply misguided, Sarkareth deserves a farewell that befits the [[dracthyr]] he once was.}}
:{{text|say|Ebyssian|Of course. I will go with you to the place he fell.}}
:''Emberthal and Ebyssian run into the instance.''
:{{text|say|Sabellian|There are still dangers remaining in Aberrus. We should not let them travel alone.}}
:{{text|say|Wrathion|Agreed. Champion, will you join us? This is a path best walked together.}}
:''Sabellian and Wrathion run up to the instance line, but stop short.''

Speak with either:
;Wrathion
:My [[Blacktalon]]s push our advantage, but the conflict rages inside. Prepare yourself.
:{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready to enter.}}
;Sabellian
:Steel yourself, <name>. Aberrus has darkness within and without.
:{{gossip|quest=|I'm ready to enter.}}

Inside are [[Horace "Scalding" Stern]], reprising his repair duties, and a number of unnamed [[Blacktalon Breacher|Blacktalon breachers]], [[Blacktalon Invoker|invokers]], [[Blacktalon Slayer|slayers]], and [[Blacktalon Strategist|strategists]].

Speak with Wrathion:
:Oh, <name>... my apologies. I was preoccupied. Was there something you needed?
:{{gossip|quest=|Can you tell me what happened in there?}}

The post-Sarkareth encounter [[Dragonflight in-game cinematics|in-engine cutscene]] plays:
{{#ev:youtube|kXAnLzt22Ug|Sarkareth Raid Finale}}
:''Sarkareth's chamber. Sarkareth is on his hands and knees, catching his breath as the last of the void smoke leaves his body.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|I was... your loyal soldier, father.}}
:''He looks up and focuses on the crack in the wall...''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Did I not... uphold your legacy?}}
:''and weakly reaches out his right hand toward it.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Was it all just... an illusion?}}
:''The camera cuts to Wrathion's face looking down at Sarkareth. Wrathion spares a quick glance in Sabellian's direction.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|Empty... promises...}}
:''The camera cuts again to Sabellian, who glances back at Wrathion. They both have unsure looks on their faces.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|leading us only...}}
:''The camera cuts back to Sarkareth has he breathes his last and collapses.''
:{{text|say|Scalecommander Sarkareth|to oblivion...}}
:''Then pulls away, looking down on Wrathion and Sabellian, silently watching.''
