Seek out your warchief. Tell him that I await him here...</p>
<p>==Notes==
:What did Garrosh tell you, <name>?</p>
<p>{{gossip|''Garrosh is beyond redemption, Greatmother.  I fear that in helping the Mag'har, I have convinced Garrosh that he is unfit to lead.''}}</p>
<p>:<Greatmother Geyah nods, accepting your answer.></p>
<p>:I can no longer fight the spirits, <name>.  My time has long since passed.  Once again, I must thank you for all that you have done.  While Garrosh may be unmoveable, many of my people have been lifted by your accomplishments.  They are now willing to fight for our rights as a unified clan.</p>
<p>{{gossip|''I have done all that I could, Greatmother.  I thank you for your kind words.''}}</p>
<p>:<Greatmother Geyah smiles at you.></p>
<p>:You remind me of my son, <name>.</p>
<p>:He was an immovable mountain.  A pillar of strength and honor.</p>
<p>:<Geyah's eyes well up with tears.></p>
<p>:He sacrificed himself so that we could survive.  So that generations of orcs after him could be born into a world without the blood curse...  Without [[Gul'dan]] and his [[Dark Horde|Old Horde]]...</p>
<p>:<Geyah stares into the distance, lost in thought.></p>
<p>:Oh [[Durotan]], how I wish you could be here.  Your people so desperately need you...</p>
<p>{{gossip|''Greatmother, you are the mother of Durotan?''}}</p>
<p>:<Greatmother Geyah nods.></p>
<p>:Did you know my son?</p>
<p>[[File:GossipGossipIcon.png]] ''Greatmother, I never had the honor.  Durotan died long before my time, but his heroics are known to all on my world.  The orcs of Azeroth reside in a place known as [[Durotar]], named after your son.  And...  <You take a moment to breathe and think through what you are about to tell the Greatmother.></p>
<p>:<Greatmother Geyah's violet eyes lock onto yours.></p>
<p>:Yes...</p>
<p>{{gossip|''It is my [[Thrall|Warchief]], Greatmother.  The leader of my people from my world.  He...  He is the son of Durotan.  He is your grandchild.''}}</p>
<p>:<Tears stream down Greatmother Geyah's face.></p>
<p>:I...  I...  Durotan survived to have a child?  The child [[Draka]] told me of before they left...  It was their greatest fear...  To raise a child in this world.  On the other side of that gate was their only hope.  I dared not tell Durotan, but secretly, I begged the spirits to watch over them- to protect their child and to give them strength.</p>
<p>:I...  I must see my grandchild.  I must see him.  Please, I am too weak.  You must tell him.  Before I leave this world...</p>
<p>{{gossip|''I will return to Azeroth at once, Greatmother.''}}</p>
<p>===Transcript from final cutscene===
''When you talk to Greatmother Geyah, you will see many of Thrall's Kor'kron elite guards aligned in two rows of wolfriders at the entrance of Garadar. Thrall will appear by Garrosh, and will start walking uphill toward the Main Hall. There Thrall kneels down in front of Greatmother Geyah, and sits. Thrall will stay there for a few hours talking to her. The Horde gets buffed. You will see thunderbolts spreading and jumping from player to player throughout Nagrand.''</p>

:{{text|say|'''Thrall says:''' Greatmother... Am I...}}
:{{text|say|'''Greatmother Geyah says:''' There is no doubt - you are the heir of Durotan... my grandson. Draka told me she was with child before she and your father left [[Draenor|our world]], but I never dared dream that they would survive...}}
:{{text|say|'''Thrall says:''' They... did not, Greatmother. They were killed shortly after I was born. I never knew them. I was raised as a slave.  To this day, I carry the name of Thrall.}}
:{{text|say|'''Greatmother Geyah says:''' Thrall? You've been a slave only to the past, grandson! But no more! When last I saw him, Durotan told me the name he would give his unborn son... He was... so proud...}}

:{{text|say|'''Greatmother Geyah says:''' Go'el. You are Go'el, son of Durotan - rightful chieftain of the [[Frostwolf clan|Frostwolves]]. This day, grandson - you are the great joy of my heart.}}
:{{text|say|'''Thrall says:''' I have dreamed of this moment all my life, Greatmother. 'Till now, all I've had were [[Orgrim Doomhammer|Orgrim's]] stories about my parents and their adventures on Draenor. He was my greatest teacher and dearest friend. He died a hero... They all died as heroes - and for all of them, a song of honor remains.}}
:{{text|say|'''Greatmother Geyah says:''' I see that you hold the Doomhammer. Have all of our greatest heroes fallen, grandson?}}
:{{text|say|'''Thrall says:''' They died honorably, Greatmother.}}
:{{text|say|'''Greatmother Geyah says:''' What of Grommash? What of Hellscream?}}
:{{text|say|'''Thrall says:''' He died as our greatest hero. It was Grom who freed us all... I was by his side when he struck down [[Mannoroth]] and ended the curse forever.}}
:{{text|say|'''Greatmother Geyah says:''' Blessed spirits! For twenty years, all we knew was that Grom was the first to drink from the cursed chalice and bring damnation down upon our people... It is the only truth his son, Garrosh has ever known.}}

:{{text|say|'''Thrall says:''' Tell him? Greatmother, that boy's father died so that all of us could live free of the blood curse. I will tell him nothing. I will show him! Show him and any that would doubt Hellscream's resolve exactly what Grom Hellscream did for all orcs!}}

:{{text|say|'''Mannoroth says:''' So predictable. I knew you would come. And I see you've brought the mighty Hellscream.}}

:{{text|say|'''Garrosh says:''' You have shown me truths that I would have never known. You and your allies have gifted me with something that cannot bear a price: Redemption. Thrall, redeemer of the [[Mag'har (faction)|Mag'har]], you honor me as none ever have...}}
:{{text|say|'''Garrosh says:''' On this day, a great burden has been lifted from my chest. My heart swells with pride. And for the first time, I can proudly proclaim who I am. I can finally unleash the fury in my heart.}}
