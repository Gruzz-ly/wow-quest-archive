<p>'''Penance and Renewal''' concludes "Epilogue: Judgment", the final chapter of the [[Zereth Mortis campaign]], thereby also making it the final quest of the overarching [[Shadowlands campaign]]. A few quests remain in the [[Shadowlands epilogue]], however.</p>
<p>==Objectives==
Speak to Tyrande at the Ring of Transference in [[Oribos]].
*Speak to [[Tyrande Whisperwind|Tyrande]] in the [[Ring of Transference]]{{Co|55.23|59.31|Oribos|1}}</p>
<p>==Description==
When I became the new [[Arbiter (title)|Arbiter]], I vowed to myself that I would listen to those around me, to take their counsel into consideration before passing eternal judgment.</p>
<p>I have an inkling of what Tyrande intends for [[Sylvanas Windrunner|Sylvanas]]. Her fury is tempered by wisdom, and I trust in the decision she has made.</p>
<p>Meet her in the Ring of Transference and see her judgment come to pass.</p>
<p>==Completion==
Justice for [[Teldrassil]]. Peace for the [[kaldorei]].</p>
<p>==Notes==
On accept:
:{{Text|say|Arbiter Pelagos|True justice brings both punishment... and renewal. I trust in Tyrande to achieve both.}}</p>
<p>Using the exit portal brings the player not to the [[Enclave]] like usual, but to just outside the [[Idyllia]] in the [[Ring of Fates]]. Take the portal back up to the [[Ring of Transference]], where a small gathering awaits: Tyrande, [[Dori'thur]], [[Shandris Feathermoon|Shandris]], and [[Maiev Shadowsong|Maiev]] are standing in front of the [[Soul Pillar]], while Sylvanas is standing with [[Alleria Windrunner|Alleria]] and [[Vereesa Windrunner|Vereesa]]. The Alliance leaders [[Anduin Wrynn|Anduin]], [[Jaina Proudmoore|Jaina]], and [[Genn Greymane|Genn]] are standing close together on the northern side of the gathering, the Horde leaders [[Lor'themar Theron|Lor'themar]], [[Baine Bloodhoof|Baine]], and [[Thrall]] on the eastern side, and [[Bolvar Fordragon|Bolvar]], [[Tal-Inara]], and [[Uther]] on the southern side.</p>
<p>Just as the player approaches, Sylvanas finishes a conversation with her sisters:
:{{Text|say|Vereesa Windrunner|...and now, after so long... there is much we need to say to one another...}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|I know, sisters. But judgment comes.}}</p>
<p>All of the characters present have unique gossip text here (except Dori'thur, since she's an owl). Much of it is faction-dependent. Jaina only speaks to Alliance players.</p>
<p>[[File:Penance and Renewal - Alliance leaders.jpg|thumb|Jaina, Anduin, and Genn]]
;Lady Jaina Proudmoore ({{Alliance}} only)
:Hatred is a cycle, <name>. One that is all too easy to perpetuate. And forgiveness does not come easily to those who have been wronged.
:Years ago, I implored others to set aside their grievances and bring that cycle to an end. Only now, after so much has happened, do I grasp the enormity of what I was asking.
:Hatred and guilt have haunted me, as they have so many others. I still believe the cycle can be broken, though it takes relentless effort... and a great deal of time.</p>
<p>;Anduin Wrynn
:The shadow of the things I've seen... what [[Zovaal|the Jailer]] forced me to do... hangs over me.
:For the part you played in setting me free, I'll always be grateful.
:But I cannot pretend that I can simply go back to being the person I was. I need... time.
:&lt;{{Alliance}} I must ask more of you. The [[Alliance]] will need your dedication, now more than ever. / {{Horde}} No doubt the [[Horde]] will rely upon your courage in the days ahead. Defend Azeroth, <name>. No matter what comes.&gt;</p>
<p>;Genn Greymane ({{Alliance}})
:I will never forgive the Banshee for what she did to Teldrassil. Or [[Gilneas (kingdom)|Gilneas]].
:Or [[Liam Greymane|my son]].
:<Greymane clenches his fist.>
:But for now, our focus must turn to Anduin. He will need our help to recover from what he's endured.</p>
<p>;Genn Greymane ({{Horde}})
:I refuse to believe that your fallen Warchief feels even the slightest remorse for her crimes.
:When will she answer for what she did to my people? To my son?
:<Greymane glowers.>
:You have much to answer for as well.</p>
<p>[[File:Penance and Renewal - Horde leaders.jpg|thumb|Lor'themar, Baine, and Thrall]]
;Lor'themar Theron
:We [[Blood elf|sin'dorei]] are no strangers to suffering and tragedy. I have seen [[High elf|my people]] [[Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas|massacred]], [[Quel'Thalas (kingdom)|my kingdom]] razed, and [[Sunwell|all I revere]] defiled.
:When [[Silvermoon City|Silvermoon]] at last rejoined the world, it was Sylvanas who extended her hand and welcomed us into the Horde.
:Those days are long behind us now. The devastation and loss inflicted upon [[Azeroth]] by the Banshee Queen is nigh incalculable.
:The knowledge that I stood by while so much of it happened still haunts me. Perhaps, in the end, judgment will come for me as well.</p>
<p>;Baine Bloodhoof
:Sylvanas had me imprisoned and tortured for defying her, though the pain she inflicted upon me pales in comparison to that of her other victims.
:For a time, I hated her for what she did to me and to the Horde. But hatred is a poison. Once it seeps into your veins, it will spell your doom.
:It is right that Sylvanas faces justice for all she has done. The guilty must stand before those they have wronged... and answer for their crimes.</p>
<p>;Thrall
:When Sylvanas sent her [[Mawsworn]] to capture me, all I wanted was to escape. To leave the [[Shadowlands]] behind and return to my home. My family.
:And yet, this journey has taught me so much. About [[Draka|my mother]], about myself, and about the legacy we all leave behind.
:This was not the path I would have chosen. But perhaps it was the path I needed to walk.</p>
<p>[[File:Penance and Renewal - Shadowlands heroes.jpg|thumb|Bolvar, Tal-Inara, and Uther]]
;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon
:As I sat for years upon the [[Frozen Throne]], I felt a malevolent shadow upon my mind. I did not realize it was the Jailer attempting to twist me into yet another of his pawns.
:It took all of my resolve to resist his influence. And still, I have no way of knowing how many of my actions furthered [[Icecrown Citadel]]'s true purpose.
:That is what is most insidious about him. Even after the Jailer's defeat, the doubt he sowed within each of us lives on.</p>
<p>;Tal-Inara
:Balance has been restored to the Shadowlands, [[Maw Walker]]. A new Arbiter speaks, with a voice for all to hear.
:To that end, Arbiter Pelagos invites you to visit him within the [[Crucible (Oribos)|Crucible]] whenever you so choose.
:Blessed be his voice.</p>
<p>;Uther
:In life, Sylvanas Windrunner served as [[Ranger-General of Silvermoon]]. If you had told her then of the atrocities she would commit in undeath, she wouldn't have believed you.
:We all sometimes harbor darkness in our hearts. I nearly succumbed to mine. What I did to [[Arthas Menethil|Arthas]] could have become the first step on a path to damnation.
:Yet from understanding flows compassion, and compassion can save us from any darkness. It is an ideal to which we must all aspire... though we must never forget that it does not come easily.</p>
<p>;Maiev Shadowsong
:Do you believe this to be justice, <class>? That Sylvanas be allowed to endure after slaughtering countless innocents?
:There was [[Wolfheart|a time]] when rage clouded my vision and I turned my glaive against my own people.
:And after my beloved comrade, [[Sira Moonwarden|Sira]], was struck down and raised into undeath, she unleashed her hatred against us.
:By rights, both our lives were forfeit. Yet I was given a chance to mend that which I had sought to tear asunder. Not for my sake, but for those whom I had wronged. I pray Sira may receive that chance as well.
:As for Sylvanas, I do not know if this is justice. But I believe that it is right.</p>
<p>;Shandris Feathermoon
:The kaldorei--those who burned as well as those who survived--have long awaited this moment. To know that the Banshee will be made to answer for all she has done.
:Many called for her head. Some still do, and I doubt that anything less will satisfy them.
:But Sylvanas spoke true when she said death would be a mercy. And if she can spare [[soul]]s from the torments of the [[Maw]], then perhaps her penance will prove more valuable than her execution.</p>
<p>[[File:Penance and Renewal - Three sisters.jpg|thumb|Vereesa, Alleria, and Sylvanas]]
;Alleria Windrunner
:As I fought [[demon]]s for centuries across the [[Twisting Nether]], I clung to the hope that I would one day hold [[Arator the Redeemer|my son]] again, and stand beside my sisters once more.
:I could never have imagined the fate that befell Sylvanas, or the monstrous choices she would make thereafter.
:Vereesa desperately hopes that the return of her soul fragment means that our sister has been returned to us. I am less certain.
:But I have learned to be patient. I will be watching...</p>
<p>;Vereesa Windrunner
:After witnessing Sylvanas's deeds during [[Fourth War|the war]], I feared the last vestige of the sister I knew was gone forever.
:But when I heard what transpired here in the Shadowlands, I had to come and see for myself.
:I'd understand if you thought me a fool for still having hope, but... I have lost so many that I loved.
:If there is even a chance that a spark of the Sylvanas I knew has returned, then I refuse to give up on her.</p>
<p>;Sylvanas Windrunner ({{Alliance}})
:Ah, <name>. You have little reason to listen to my words, but I offer them nonetheless.
:Nothing I say or do can change what I have done. My judgement is at hand, and I accept whatever comes.
:In life, I fought to protect my home. It is good that Azeroth has you and your allies to defend her.
:Farewell.</p>
<p>;Sylvanas Windrunner ({{Horde}} rebel and default for characters who haven't completed [[Tracking Tipoff]])
:Ah, <name>. Before I face the coming judgment, I would share words with you.
:I was [[News from Oribos|recently reminded]] that we cannot change the past. If you choose to hate me for the things I've done, I could not blame you for it.
:But know this. We shared common cause once, and you have proven your dedication to the Horde time and again. I hope that you will continue to defend it, no matter what may come.</p>
<p>;Sylvanas Windrunner ({{Horde}} loyalist)
:<Name>. It is fitting that we share a few final words here, as I stand upon the precipice of judgment.
:You have shown me loyalty time and time again, even when others spurned you for it. Even when my own actions did not merit such dedication.
:I'm not certain what fate awaits me. But if one day I have need of trusted allies, I know that I can call upon you.</p>
<p>;Tyrande Whisperwind
:The Banshee tore a gaping wound in the soul of my people. She set our home aflame and sent countless kaldorei to the Maw.
:Whatever judgment the Arbiter hands down can never balance the scales. Nothing he can do or say will ever be enough.
:{{Gossip|<Witness Tyrande's judgement.>}}</p>
<p>A real-time cutscene plays.</p>
<p>{{#ev:youtube|TvSr815MoTM}}
:''At the start of the cutscene, the Maw Walker and all of the characters have moved closer to the Soul Pillar, with Sylvanas standing near the edge. Dori'thur circles overhead as Tyrande walks past Sylvanas to the edge.''
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Below lies the Maw.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|An unjust fate to which you doomed so many.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|And it will be there... that your penance begins.}}
:''Tyrande circles around Sylvanas as she speaks.''
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Every soul lost in its depths, betrayed or condemned...}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|you shall find and send forth to the Arbiter}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|to be judged with the compassion all souls deserve.}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|You will toil there, under Dori'thur's watchful eye,}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|scouring every darkened reach,}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|until the final soul is free, and you are all that remains.}}
:''Tyrande walks back to the others.''
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|This... is how you shall bring renewal to your victims,}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|and my people.}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|However long it takes...}}
:{{Text|say|Sylvanas Windrunner|it shall be done.}}
:''Tyrande holds out her arm and Dori'thur lands on it.''
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Andu-falah-dor, old friend. Watch her well.}}
:''Dori'thur alights from Tyrande and begins flying around the Soul Pillar. Sylvanas turns to face the pillar, takes a deep breath, and looks back on Vereesa, who looks saddened, and Alleria, who looks angered. She then then leaps into the pillar. Dori'thur dives down beside her, and they both disappear down into the Maw.''</p>

</gallery></p>
<p>On the other side of the cutscene, turn in to Tyrande. Upon completion, most of the gathered characters walk away in different directions. The Windrunner sisters and the night elves remain where they are.
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|The Banshee's penance will save countless lost souls. A fate that would not come to pass had I slain her in [[Ardenweald]].}}
:{{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Perhaps this is why [[Elune|Mother Moon]] [[The Battle of Ardenweald#Stage 9: The Forest Answers|stayed my hand]].}}</p>
<p>The last line of dialogue depends on player's faction:
<em>{{Alliance}} {{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|Thank you for your aid, <name>. Soon I must return to Azeroth to begin healing the kaldorei and preserving our future.}}
</em>{{Horde}} {{Text|say|Tyrande Whisperwind|The Horde inflicted a grievous wound upon my people, <name>. You may never earn my trust... but you have my thanks for setting things right.}}</p>
<p>She, Shandris, and Maiev then walk off, use the portal down to the Ring of Fates, and disappear.</p>
<p>===Post-quest dialogue===
After completing this last part of the expansion storyline, a number of "Stay awhile and listen" dialogues unlock around Oribos, similar to after [[Covenants Renewed]] at the end of the [[Chains of Domination campaign]]. Characters with dialogues display a large {{Gossip icon}} icon above their head. The icon disappears after the first time the player triggers the dialogue, but the option remains permanently available from the NPCs in case the player wants to see the dialogue again. Unless otherwise noted, the NPCs continue to have the same initial gossip text as they did before the finale cutscene. The player also, for the first time, unlocks permanent access to the Crucible and can travel to and from it at will by talking to Tal-Inara in the Enclave.</p>

:With the Jailer defeated, the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]] need no longer maintain a presence in Oribos. We will soon make our exodus from the city and return to Azeroth.
:However, our vigil is far from over. Without the [[Helm of Domination]] to control them, the [[Scourge]] threaten to spread across the world like the [[Plague of Undeath|plague that created them]].
